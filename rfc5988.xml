    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies relation types for Web links, and defines a registry for them. It
        also defines the use of such links in HTTP headers with the Link header field. </t>
    </abstract>

  </front>

  <middle>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>A means of indicating the relationships between resources on the Web, as well as indicating
        the type of those relationships, has been available for some time in HTML <xref
          target="W3C.REC-html401-19991224" />, and more recently in Atom <xref target="RFC4287" />.
        These mechanisms, although conceptually similar, are separately specified. However, links between
        resources need not be format specific; it can be useful to have typed links that are
        independent of their serialisation, especially when a resource has representations in multiple
        formats.</t>

      <t>To this end, this document defines a framework for typed links that isn't specific to a
		particular serialisation or application. It does so by redefining the link relation registry 
		established by Atom to have a broader domain, and adding to it the relations that are defined by HTML.</t>
		
      <t>Furthermore, an HTTP header field for conveying typed links was defined in Section 19.6.2.4 of <xref
          target="RFC2068" />, but removed from <xref target="RFC2616" />, due to a lack of
        implementation experience. Since then, it has been implemented in some User Agents (e.g., for stylesheets), and 
        several additional use cases have surfaced.</t>

      <t>Because it was removed, the status of the Link header is unclear, leading some to
        consider minting new application-specific HTTP headers instead of reusing it. This document
        addresses this by re-specifying the Link header as one such serialisation, with updated but 
		backwards-compatible syntax.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Notational Conventions">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
        "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
        BCP 14, <xref target="RFC2119" />, as scoped to those conformance targets.</t>

      <t>This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of <xref target="RFC2616"
         />, and explicitly includes the following rules from it: quoted-string, token, SP (space),
		LOALPHA, DIGIT.</t>
		
	  <t>Additionally, the following rules are included from <xref target="RFC3986" />: URI and
        URI-Reference; from <xref target="RFC4288" />: type-name and subtype-name; from <xref
          target="W3C.REC-html401-19991224" />: MediaDesc; from <xref target="RFC5646"/>: Language-Tag;
        and from <xref target="RFC5987"/>, ext-value and parmname.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Links" anchor="links">
      <t>In this specification, a link is a typed connection between two resources that are identified by Internationalised Resource Identifiers (IRIs) <xref target="RFC3987"/>, and is comprised of: <list style="symbols">
          <t>A context IRI,</t>
          <t>a link relation type (<xref target="link-relationship-types" />),</t>
          <t>a target IRI, and</t>
		  <t>optionally, target attributes.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

		<t>A link can be viewed as a statement of the form "{context IRI} has a {relation type} resource at {target IRI}, 
		which has {target attributes}".</t>

		<t>Note that in the common case, the context IRI will also be a URI <xref target="RFC3986"/>, because many protocols
		(such as HTTP) do not support dereferencing IRIs. Likewise, the target IRI will be converted to a URI (see 
		<xref target="RFC3987"/>, Section 3.1) in serialisations that do not support IRIs (e.g., the Link header).</t>

		<t>This specification does not place restrictions on the cardinality of links; there can be multiple links to and from a particular IRI, and multiple links of different types between two given IRIs. Likewise, the relative ordering
		of links in any particular serialisation, or between serialisations (e.g., the Link header and in-content links) is 
		not specified or significant in this specification; applications that wish to consider ordering significant can do
		so.</t>

		<t>Target attributes are a set of key/value pairs that describe the link or its target; for example, a media type hint. 
		This specification does not attempt to coordinate their names or use, but does provide common target attributes 
		for use in the Link HTTP header.</t>

		<t>Finally, this specification does not define a general syntax for expressing links, nor does it mandate a specific 
		context for any given link; it is expected that serialisations of links will specify both aspects. One such
		serialisation is communication of links through HTTP headers, specified in <xref target="header.link" />.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="link-relationship-types" title="Link Relation Types">
      	<t>In the simplest case, a link relation type identifies the semantics of a link. For example, a link
        with the relation type "copyright" indicates that the resource identified by the target IRI is a statement of
        the copyright terms applying to the current context IRI.</t>

		<t>Link relation types can also be used to indicate that the target resource has particular attributes, or 
		exhibits particular behaviours; for example, a "service" link implies that the identified resource is part of
		a defined protocol (in this case, a service description).</t>

      	<t>Relation types are not to be confused with media types <xref target="RFC4288" />; they
        do not identify the format of the representation that results when the link is dereferenced.
        Rather, they only describe how the current context is related to another resource.</t>

		<t>Relation types SHOULD NOT infer any additional semantics based upon the presence or absence of
		another link relation type, or its own cardinality of occurrence. An exception to this is the combination of 
		the "alternate" and "stylesheet" registered relation types, which has special meaning in HTML4 for historical
		reasons.</t>

      	<t>There are two kinds of relation types: registered and extension.</t>

	<section title="Registered Relation Types" anchor="registered-relation-types">
	  	<t>Well-defined relation types can be registered as tokens for convenience and/or to promote reuse by other applications. This 
		specification establishes an IANA registry of such relation types; see <xref target="link-relation-registry"/>.</t>

		<t>Registered relation type names MUST conform to the reg-rel-type rule, and MUST be compared character-by-character 
		in a case-insensitive fashion. They SHOULD be appropriate to the specificity of the relation type; i.e., if the semantics 
		are highly specific to a particular application, the name should reflect that, so that more general names are available for
		less specific use.</t>
			
		<t>Registered relation types MUST NOT constrain the media type of the context IRI, and MUST NOT constrain the available 
		representation media types of the target IRI. However, they can specify the behaviours and properties of the target resource 
		(e.g., allowable HTTP methods, request and response media types that must be supported).</t>
		
		<t>Additionally, specific applications of linking may require additional data to be included in the registry. For example, 
		Web browsers might want to know what kinds of links should be downloaded when they archive a Web page;
		if this application-specific information is in the registry, new link relation types can control this behaviour 
		without unnecessary coordination.</t>

		<t>To accommodate this, per-entry application data can be added to the Link Relation Type registry, by registering it 
		in the Link Relation Application Data registry (<xref target="data_registry"/>).</t>
		
	</section>

	<section title="Extension Relation Types" anchor="extension-relation-types">
      	<t>Applications that don't wish to register a relation type can use an extension relation type, which is
		a URI <xref target="RFC3986"/> that uniquely identifies the relation type. Although the URI can point to a 
		resource that contains a definition of the semantics of the relation type, clients SHOULD NOT automatically 
		access that resource to avoid overburdening its server.</t> 
		
		<t>When extension relation types are compared, they MUST be compared as strings (after converting to URIs
			if serialised in a different format, such as a Curie <xref target="W3C.CR-curie-20090116"/>) in a case-insensitive fashion,
			 character-by-character. Because of this, all-lowercase URIs SHOULD be used for extension relations.</t>
		
		<t>Note that while extension relation types are required to be URIs, a serialisation of links can specify
			that they are expressed in another form, as long as they can be converted to URIs.</t>
</section>
</section>

    <section anchor="header.link" title="The Link Header Field">
      <t>The Link entity-header field provides a means for serialising one or more links in HTTP headers. It is 
	semantically equivalent to the &lt;LINK&gt; element in HTML, as well as the atom:link feed-level element 
	in Atom <xref target="RFC4287" />. </t>

	<section title="Target IRI">

	  <t>Each link-value conveys one target IRI as a URI-Reference (after conversion to one, if necessary; see <xref target="RFC3987"/>, Section 3.1) inside angle 
		brackets ("&lt;&gt;"). If the URI-Reference is relative, parsers MUST resolve it as per <xref target="RFC3986"/>, Section 5. 
		Note that any base IRI from the message's content is not applied.</t>
		
	</section>
    <section title="Context IRI">

        <t>By default, the context of a link conveyed in the Link header field is the IRI of the requested resource.</t>
            
      <t>When present, the anchor parameter overrides this with another URI, such as a fragment of this resource, or a third resource (i.e., when the anchor value is an absolute URI). If the anchor parameter's value is a relative URI, parsers MUST resolve it as per <xref target="RFC3986"/>, Section 5. Note that any base URI from the body's content is not applied.</t>
            
      <t>Consuming implementations can choose to ignore links with an anchor parameter. For example, the application in use may not allow the context IRI to be assigned to a different resource. In such cases, the entire link is to be ignored; consuming implementations MUST NOT process the link without applying the anchor.</t>
            
            <!-- probably need to revisit security considerations -->

       <t>Note that depending on HTTP status code and response headers, the context IRI might be "anonymous" (i.e., no context IRI is available). For instance, this is the case on a 404 response to a GET request.</t>

    </section>

	<section title="Relation Type">

      <t>The relation type of a link is conveyed in the "rel" parameter's value. The "rel" parameter MUST NOT appear more 
		than once in a given link-value; occurrences after the first MUST be ignored 
		by parsers.</t>
	
	  <t>The "rev" parameter has been used in the past to indicate that the semantics of the relationship are
		in the reverse direction. That is, a link from A to B with REL="X" expresses the same relationship as a link from B 
		to A with REV="X". "rev" is deprecated by this specification because it often confuses authors and readers; in most
		cases, using a separate relation type is preferable.</t>
		
      <t>Note that extension relation types are REQUIRED to be absolute URIs in Link headers, and MUST be quoted if they
		contain a semicolon (";") or comma (",") (as these characters are used as delimiters in the header itself).</t>
	
	</section>
	<section title="Target Attributes">

	  <t>The "hreflang", "media", "title", "title*", "type", and any link-extension link-params are considered to be target 
		attributes for the link.</t>

	  <t>The "hreflang" parameter, when present, is a hint indicating what the language of the result of dereferencing the link should
		be. Note that this is only a hint; for example, it does not override the Content-Language header of a HTTP response 
		obtained by actually following the link. Multiple "hreflang" parameters on a single link-value indicate that multiple languages
		are available from the indicated resource.</t>

	  <t>The "media" parameter, when present, is used to indicate intended destination medium or media for style information (see
		<xref target="W3C.REC-html401-19991224" />, Section 6.13). Note that this may be updated by <xref target="W3C.CR-css3-mediaqueries-20090915"/>). 
		Its value MUST be quoted if it contains a semicolon (";") or comma (","), and there MUST NOT be more than one "media" 
		parameter in a link-value.</t>

      <t>The "title" parameter, when present, is used to label the destination of a link such that it can be used as a 
		human-readable identifier (e.g., a menu entry) in the language indicated by the Content-Language header (if present). 
		The "title" parameter MUST NOT appear more than once in a given link-value; occurrences after the first MUST be ignored by 
		parsers.</t>

	  <t>The "title*" parameter can be used to encode this label in a different character set, and/or contain language information as per
		<xref target="RFC5987"/>. The "title*" parameter MUST NOT appear more than once in a given link-value; occurrences 
		after the first MUST be ignored by parsers. If the parameter does not contain language information, its language is indicated by the
		Content-Language header (when present).</t>
		
	  <t>If both the "title" and "title*" parameters appear in a link-value, processors SHOULD use the "title*" parameter's value.</t>

	  <t>The "type" parameter, when present, is a hint indicating what the media type of the result of dereferencing the link
		should be. Note that this is only a hint; for example, it does not override the Content-Type header of a HTTP response
		obtained by actually following the link. There MUST NOT be more than one type parameter in a link-value.</t>
		
	</section>

	<section title="Examples">

		      <t>For example:</t>

		      <figure>
		        <artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
Link: <http://example.com/TheBook/chapter2>; rel="previous";
      title="previous chapter"
]]></artwork>
		      </figure>

		      <t>indicates that "chapter2" is previous to this resource in a logical navigation path.</t>
		
			  <t>Similarly,</t>

		      <figure>
		        <artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
Link: </>; rel="http://example.net/foo"
]]></artwork>
		      </figure>

			<t>indicates that the root resource ("/") is related to this resource with the extension relation type "http://example.net/foo".</t>

			<t>The example below shows an instance of the Link header encoding multiple links, and also the use of RFC 2231 encoding to encode both non-ASCII characters and language information.</t>

		      <figure>
		        <artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
Link: </TheBook/chapter2>;
      rel="previous"; title*=UTF-8'de'letztes%20Kapitel,
      </TheBook/chapter4>;
      rel="next"; title*=UTF-8'de'n%c3%a4chstes%20Kapitel
				]]></artwork>
	      </figure>

			<t>Here, both links have titles encoded in UTF-8, use the German language ("de"), and the second link contains the Unicode code point U+00E4 ("LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS").</t>

      <t>Note that link-values can convey multiple links between the same target and context IRIs; for example:</t>

      <figure>
        <artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
    Link: <http://example.org/>; 
          rel="start http://example.net/relation/other"
]]></artwork>
      </figure>
 	<t>Here, the link to "http://example.org/" has the registered relation type  
	"start" and the extension relation type "http://example.net/relation/other".</t>

		<t>The underlying registry data (e.g., the XML file)  must

		<section title="Registering New Link Relation Types">

		<t>Relation types are registered on the advice of a Designated Expert (appointed by the 
			IESG or their delegate), with a Specification Required (using terminology from <xref target="RFC5226"/>).</t>
		
        <t>The requirements for registered relation types are described in <xref target="registered-relation-types"/>.</t>

		<t>Registration requests consist of the completed registration template 
			below, typically published in an RFC or Open Standard (in the sense described
		    by <xref target="RFC2026"/>, Section 7). However, to allow for the
			allocation of values prior to publication, the Designated Expert may approve 
			registration once they are satisfied that a specification will be published.</t>

		<t>Note that relation types can be registered by third parties, if the Designated Expert determines that an
			unregistered relation type is widely deployed and not likely to be registered in a timely manner.</t>

		<t>The registration template is:</t>

        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Relation Name: </t>
            <t>Description:</t>

			<t>Notes: [optional]</t>
			<t>Application Data: [optional]</t>
          </list>
        </t>

		<t>Registration requests should be sent to the link-relations@ietf.org mailing list, marked clearly in the subject line
			(e.g., "NEW RELATION - example" to register an "example" relation type).</t>

	    <t>Within at most 14 days of the request, the Designated Expert(s) will either approve or deny the
		    registration request, communicating this decision to the review list and IANA. Denials should include an explanation
			and, if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request successful.</t>

		<t>Decisions (or lack thereof) made by the Designated Expert can be first appealed to Application Area Directors (contactable 
			using app-ads@tools.ietf.org email address or
			directly by looking up their email addresses
			on http://www.iesg.org/ 
			website) and, if the appellant is not satisfied with the response, to the full IESG (using the iesg@iesg.org mailing
			list).</t>

      <t>IANA should only accept registry updates from the Designated Expert(s), and should direct all requests for registration
      to the review mailing list.</t>

				automated transaction. In Atom documents, a link element with a rel="payment"
				attribute may exist at the feed/channel level and/or
				the entry/item level. For example, a rel="payment" link at
				the feed/channel level may point to a "tip jar" URI, whereas
				an entry/item containing a book review may include a

				where the book may be purchased through an online retailer.</t>

	<section title="Link Relation Application Data Registry" anchor="data_registry">
		
		<t>This specification also establishes the Link Relation Application Field registry, to allow entries in the Link Relation Type
			registry to be extended with application-specific data (hereafter, "app data") specific to all instances of a
			given link relation type.</t>

		<t>Application data is registered on the advice of a Designated Expert (appointed by the 
			IESG or their delegate), with a Specification Required (using terminology from <xref target="RFC5226"/>).</t>

		<t>Registration requests consist of the completed registration template below;</t>

        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Application Name: </t>
            <t>Description: </t>
            <t>Default Value: </t>
	    <t>Notes: [optional]</t>
          </list>
        </t>

		<t>The Description SHOULD identify the value space of the app data. The Default Value MUST be appropriate to entries to which 
			the app data does not apply.</t>

		<t>Entries that pre-date the addition of app data will automatically be considered to have the default value for that
			app data; if there are exceptions, the modification of such entries should be coordinated by the Designated Expert(s), 
			in consultation with the author of the proposed app data as well as the registrant of the existing entry (if possible).</t>

		<t>Registration requests should be sent to the link-relations@ietf.org mailing list, marked clearly in the subject line
			(e.g., "NEW APP DATA - example" to register "example" app data).</t>

	    <t>Within at most 14 days of the request, the Designated Expert will either approve or deny the
		    registration request, communicating this decision to the review list. Denials should include an explanation
			and, if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request successful. Registration requests that are undetermined
			for a period longer than 21 days can be brought to the IESG's attention (using the iesg@iesg.org mailing list) 
			for resolution.</t>

      <t>When a registration request is successful, the Designated Expert will forward it to IANA for publication.
      IANA should only accept registry updates from the Designated Expert(s), and should direct all requests for registration
      to the review mailing list.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The content of the Link header field is not secure, private or integrity-guaranteed, and
        due caution should be exercised when using it. Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) with HTTP (<xref target="RFC2818"/> 
		and <xref target="RFC2817"/>) is currently the only end-to-end way to provide such protection.</t>

      <t>Applications that take advantage of typed links should consider the attack vectors opened
        by automatically following, trusting, or otherwise using links gathered from HTTP
      headers. In particular, Link headers that use the "anchor" parameter to associate a link's 
	  context with another resource should be treated with due caution.</t>
	
	  <t>The Link entity-header field makes extensive use of IRIs and URIs. See <xref target="RFC3987"/> for security 
		considerations relating to IRIs. See <xref target="RFC3986"/> for security considerations relating to URIs.
	   See <xref target="RFC2616"/> for security considerations relating to HTTP headers.</t>
	
    </section> 

	<section title="Internationalisation Considerations">
		<t>Target IRIs may need to be converted to URIs in order to express them in 
			serialisations that do not support IRIs. This includes the Link HTTP header.</t>
		<t>Similarly, the anchor parameter of the Link header does not support IRIs, and therefore
			IRIs must be converted to URIs before inclusion there.</t>
		<t>Relation types are defined as URIs, not IRIs, to aid in their comparison. It is not expected that they will be displayed to end users.</t>

    <section title="Notes on Using the Link Header with the HTML4 Format">
      <t>HTML motivated the original syntax of the Link header, and many of the design decisions in
        this document are driven by a desire to stay compatible with these uses.</t>

      <t>In HTML4, the link element can be mapped to links as specified here by using the "href"
        attribute for the target URI, and "rel" to convey the relation type, as in the Link header.
		The context of the link is the URI associated with the entire HTML document.</t>

      <t>All of the link relation types defined by HTML4 have been included in the Link Relation Type
        registry, so they can be used without modification. However, there are several potential ways to 
		serialise extension relation types into HTML4, including</t>
		
	  <t><list style="symbols">
		<t>As absolute URIs,</t>
		<t>using the document-wide "profile" attribute's URI as a prefix for relation types, or</t>
		<t>using the RDFa <xref target="W3C.REC-rdfa-syntax-20081014"/> convention of mapping token prefixes to 
		URIs (in a manner similar to XML name spaces) (note that RDFa is only defined to work in XHTML <xref 
		target="W3C.REC-xhtml-basic-20080729"/>, but is sometimes used in HTML4).</t>
	  </list></t>

	  <t>Individual applications of linking will therefore need to define how their extension links should be 
		serialised into HTML4.</t>

	  <t>Surveys of existing HTML content have shown that unregistered link relation types that are not
		URIs are (perhaps inevitably) common. Consuming HTML implementations should not
		consider such unregistered short links to be errors, but rather relation types with a local
		scope (i.e., their meaning is specific and perhaps private to that document).</t>

      <t>HTML4 also defines several attributes on links that are not explicitly defined by the Link
        header. These attributes can be serialised as link-extensions to maintain fidelity.</t>

	  <t>Finally, the HTML4 specification gives a special meaning when the "alternate" and "stylesheet"
		relation types coincide in the same link. Such links should be serialised in the Link header using a
		single list of relation-types (e.g., rel="alternate stylesheet") to preserve this relationship.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Notes on Using the Link Header with the Atom Format">
      <t>Atom conveys links in the atom:link element, with the "href" attribute indicating the target
        IRI and the "rel" attribute containing the relation type. The context of the link is either
        a feed IRI or an entry ID, depending on where it appears; generally, feed-level links are obvious candidates
		for transmission as a Link header.</t>

	  <t>When serialising an atom:link into a Link header, it is necessary to convert target IRIs (if used)
        to URIs.</t>

      <t>Atom defines extension relation types in terms of IRIs. This specification re-defines
		them as URIs, to simplify and reduce errors in their comparison.</t>

	  <t>Atom allows registered link relation types to be serialised as absolute URIs. 
		Such relation types SHOULD be converted to the appropriate registered form
		(e.g., "http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/self" to "self") so that they are not mistaken
		for extension relation types.</t>

	  <t>Furthermore, Atom link relation types are always compared in a case-sensitive fashion; therefore, registered link
		relation types SHOULD be converted to their registered form (usually, lowercase) when serialised in an Atom
		document.</t>

      <t>Note also that while the Link header allows multiple relations to be serialised in a
        single link, atom:link does not. In this case, a single link-value may map to several
        atom:link elements.</t>

      <t>As with HTML, atom:link defines some attributes that are not explicitly mirrored in the
        Link header syntax, but they can also be used as link-extensions to maintain fidelity.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Acknowledgements">
      <t>This specification lifts the idea and definition for the Link header from RFC 2068; credit
        for it belongs entirely to the authors of and contributors to that document. The link
        relation type registrations themselves are sourced from several documents; see the applicable
        references.</t>

      <t>The author would like to thank the many people who commented upon, encouraged and gave
        feedback to this specification, especially including Frank Ellermann, Roy Fielding, Eran Hammer-Lahav, and Julian Reschke.</t>
