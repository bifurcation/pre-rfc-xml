    <abstract>
    <t>Unmanaged large buffers in today's networks have given rise to a slew of performance issues. These performance issues can be addressed by some form of Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanism, optionally in combination with a packet-scheduling scheme such as fair queuing. This document describes various criteria for performing characterizations of AQM schemes that can be used in lab testing during development, prior to deployment.</t>

<section anchor="sec:introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Active Queue Management (AQM) addresses the concerns arising from using
unnecessarily large and unmanaged buffers to improve network and application
performance, such as those presented in Section 1.2 of the AQM recommendations
document <xref target="RFC7567"></xref>. Several AQM algorithms have been
proposed in the past years, most notably Random Early Detection (RED) <xref
target="FLOY1993"></xref>, BLUE <xref target="FENG2002"></xref>, Proportional Integral controller (PI) <xref target="HOLLO2001"></xref>, and
more recently, Controlled Delay (CoDel) <xref target="CODEL"> </xref> and
Proportional Integral controller Enhanced (PIE) <xref
target="AQMPIE"> </xref>. In general, these algorithms actively
interact with the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and any other transport
protocol that deploys a congestion control scheme to manage the amount of data
they keep in the network. The available buffer space in the routers and
switches should be large enough to accommodate the short-term buffering
requirements. AQM schemes aim at reducing buffer occupancy, and therefore the
end-to-end delay. Some of these algorithms, notably RED, have also been widely
implemented in some network devices. However, the potential benefits of the
RED scheme have not been realized since RED is reported to be usually turned
off.</t>

<t>A buffer is a physical volume of memory in which a queue or set of queues
are stored. When speaking of a specific queue in this document, "buffer
occupancy" refers to the amount of data (measured in bytes or packets) that
are in the queue, and the "maximum buffer size" refers to the maximum buffer
occupancy. In switches and routers, a global memory space is often shared
between the available interfaces, and thus, the maximum buffer size for any
given interface may vary over time.</t>

<t>Bufferbloat <xref target="BB2011"></xref> is the consequence of deploying
large, unmanaged buffers on the Internet -- the buffering has often been
measured to be ten times or a hundred times larger than needed. Large buffer sizes in combination with TCP and/or unresponsive flows increases end-to-end delay. This results in poor performance for latency-sensitive applications such as real-time multimedia (e.g., voice, video, gaming, etc.). The degree to which this affects modern networking equipment, especially consumer-grade equipment, produces problems even with commonly used web services. Active queue management is thus essential to control queuing delay and decrease network latency.</t>
<t>The Active Queue Management and Packet Scheduling Working Group (AQM WG)
was chartered to address the problems with large unmanaged buffers in the
Internet. Specifically, the AQM WG is tasked with standardizing AQM schemes
that not only address concerns with such buffers, but are also robust under a
wide variety of operating conditions. This document provides characterization
guidelines that can be used to assess the applicability, performance, and
deployability of an AQM, whether it is a candidate for standardization at IETF or not.</t>
<t>The AQM algorithm implemented in a router can be separated from the
scheduling of packets sent out by the router as discussed in the AQM
recommendations document <xref target="RFC7567"></xref>. The rest of this memo
refers to the AQM as a dropping/marking policy as a separate feature to any
interface-scheduling scheme. This document may be complemented with another
one on guidelines for assessing the combination of packet scheduling and
AQM. We note that such a document will inherit all the guidelines from this
document, plus any additional scenarios relevant for packet scheduling such as
flow-starvation evaluation or the impact of the number of hash buckets.</t>

<section anchor="subsec:intro_tradeoff" title="Reducing the Latency and Maximizing the Goodput">
<t>The trade-off between reducing the latency and maximizing the goodput is intrinsically linked to each AQM scheme and is key to evaluating its performance. To ensure the safety deployment of an AQM, its behavior should be assessed in a variety of scenarios. Whenever possible, solutions ought to aim at both maximizing goodput and minimizing latency.</t>
</section>


<section anchor="subsec:intro_obj" title="Goals of This Document">
<t>This document recommends a generic list of scenarios against which an AQM
proposal should be evaluated, considering both potential performance gain and
safety of deployment. The guidelines help to quantify performance of AQM
schemes in terms of latency reduction, goodput maximization, and the trade-off
between these two. The document presents central aspects of an AQM algorithm
that should be considered, whatever the context, such as burst absorption
capacity, RTT fairness, or resilience to fluctuating network conditions. The
guidelines also discuss methods to understand the various aspects associated
with safely deploying and operating the AQM scheme. Thus, one of the key
objectives behind formulating the guidelines is to help ascertain whether a
specific AQM is not only better than drop-tail (i.e., without AQM and with a
BDP-sized buffer), but also safe to deploy: the guidelines can be used to
compare several AQM proposals with each other, but should be used to compare a
proposal with drop-tail.</t>
    <t>This memo details generic characterization scenarios against which any AQM proposal should be evaluated, irrespective of whether or not an AQM is standardized by the IETF. This document recommends the relevant scenarios and metrics to be considered. This document presents central aspects of an AQM algorithm that should be considered whatever the context, such as burst absorption capacity, RTT fairness, or resilience to fluctuating network conditions.</t> 
<t>These guidelines do not define and are not bound to a particular deployment
scenario or evaluation toolset. Instead, the guidelines can be used to assert
the potential gain of introducing an AQM for the particular environment, which
is of interest to the testers. These guidelines do not cover every possible
aspect of a particular algorithm. These guidelines do not present
context-dependent scenarios (such as IEEE 802.11 WLANs, data centers, or rural broadband networks). To keep the guidelines generic, a number of potential router components and algorithms (such as Diffserv) are omitted.</t>

<t>The goals of this document can thus be summarized as follows:</t>
<t><list style="symbols">
<t>The present characterization guidelines provide a non-exhaustive list of scenarios to help ascertain whether an AQM is not only better than drop-tail (with a BDP-sized buffer), but also safe to deploy; the guidelines can also be used to compare several AQM proposals with each other.</t>
<t>The present characterization guidelines (1) are not bound to a particular evaluation toolset and (2) can be used for various deployment contexts; testers are free to select a toolset that is best suited for the environment in which their proposal will be deployed.</t>
<t>The present characterization guidelines are intended to provide guidance for better selecting an AQM for a specific environment; it is not required that an AQM proposal is evaluated following these guidelines for its standardization.</t>

        <section anchor="sec:e2e_metrics" title="End-to-End Metrics">
          <t>End-to-end delay is the result of propagation delay, serialization delay, service delay in a switch, medium-access delay, and queuing delay, summed over the network elements along the path. AQM schemes may reduce the queuing delay by providing signals to the sender on the emergence of congestion, but any impact on the goodput must be carefully considered. This section presents the metrics that could be used to better quantify (1) the reduction of latency, (2) maximization of goodput, and (3) the trade-off between these two. This section provides normative requirements for metrics that can be used to assess the performance of an AQM scheme.</t>
          <t>Some metrics listed in this section are not suited to every type of traffic detailed in the rest of this document. It is therefore not necessary to measure all of the following metrics: the chosen metric may not be relevant to the context of the evaluation scenario (e.g., latency vs. goodput trade-off in application-limited traffic scenarios). Guidance is provided for each metric.</t>

<section anchor="subsec:e2e_metrics_complet_time" title="Flow Completion Time">
          <t>The flow completion time is an important performance metric for the end-user when the flow size is finite. The definition of the flow size may be a source of contradictions, thus, this metric can consider a flow as a single file. Considering the fact that an AQM scheme may drop/mark packets, the flow completion time is directly linked to the dropping/marking policy of the AQM scheme. This metric helps to better assess the performance of an AQM depending on the flow size. The Flow Completion Time (FCT) is related to the flow size (Fs) and the goodput for the flow (G) as follows:</t>
          <t> FCT [s] = Fs [byte] / ( G [bit/s] / 8 [bit/byte] ) </t>
 <t>Where flow size is the size of the transport-layer payload in bits and goodput is the transport-layer payload transfer time (described in <xref target="subsec:e2e_metrics_goodput"> </xref>).</t> 
      <t>If this metric is used to evaluate the performance of web transfers,
      it is suggested to rather consider the time needed to download all the
      objects that compose the web page, as this makes more sense in terms of
      user experience, rather than assessing the time needed to download each object.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="subsec:e2e_metrics_flow_start" title="Flow Startup Time">
          <t>The flow startup time is the time between when the request was
	  sent from the client and when the server starts to transmit
	  data. The amount of packets dropped by an AQM may seriously affect
	  the waiting period during which the data transfer has not
	  started. This metric would specifically focus on the operations such
	  as DNS lookups, TCP opens, and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) handshakes.</t>
</section>
<section anchor="subsec:e2e_metrics_loss" title="Packet Loss">
          <t>Packet loss can occur en route, this can impact the end-to-end performance measured at the receiver end.</t>
<t>The tester should evaluate the loss experienced at the receiver end using one of two metrics:</t>
<t><list style="symbols">
<t>The packet loss ratio: This metric is to be frequently measured during the experiment. The long-term loss ratio is of interest for steady-state scenarios only;</t>
        <t>The interval between consecutive losses: The time between two losses is to be measured.</t>

</list></t>

        <t>The packet loss ratio can be assessed by simply evaluating the loss ratio as a function of the number of lost packets and the total number of packets sent. This might not be easily done in laboratory testing, for which these guidelines advise the tester:</t>
<t><list style="symbols">
            <t>To check that for every packet, a corresponding packet was received within a reasonable time, as presented in the document that proposes a metric for one-way packet loss across Internet paths <xref target="RFC2680"> </xref>.</t>
            <t>To keep a count of all packets sent, and a count of the
	    non-duplicate packets received, as discussed in <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>, which
	    presents a benchmarking methodology.</t>
</list></t>
        <t>The interval between consecutive losses, which is also called a "gap", is a metric of interest for Voice over IP (VoIP) traffic <xref target="RFC3611"> </xref>.</t>
</section>


        <section anchor="subsec:e2e_metrics_synch_loss" title="Packet Loss Synchronization">
        <t>One goal of an AQM algorithm is to help to avoid global
	synchronization of flows sharing a bottleneck buffer on which the AQM
	operates (<xref target="RFC2309"> </xref> and <xref target="RFC7567"></xref>). The "degree" of packet-loss synchronization between flows should be assessed, with and without the AQM under consideration.</t> 
        <t>Loss synchronization among flows may be quantified by several slightly different metrics that capture different aspects of the same issue <xref target="HASS2008"></xref>. However, in real-world measurements the choice of metric could be imposed by practical considerations -- e.g., whether fine-grained information on packet losses at the bottleneck is available or not. For the purpose of AQM characterization, a good candidate metric is the global synchronization ratio, measuring the proportion of flows losing packets during a loss event. This metric can be used in real-world experiments to characterize synchronization along arbitrary Internet paths <xref target="JAY2006"></xref>.</t> 
        <t>If an AQM scheme is evaluated using real-life network environments,
	it is worth pointing out that some network events, such as failed link
	restoration may cause synchronized losses between active flows, and thus confuse the meaning of this metric.</t>
	</section>

        <section anchor="subsec:e2e_metrics_goodput" title="Goodput">
        <t>The goodput has been defined as the number of bits per the unit of time
	forwarded to the correct destination interface, minus any bits lost or
	retransmitted, such as proposed in Section 3.17 of <xref
	target="RFC2647"> </xref>, which describes the benchmarking terminology for firewall performances. This definition requires that the test setup needs to be qualified to assure that it is not generating losses on its own.</t>
          <t>Measuring the end-to-end goodput provides an appreciation of how well an AQM scheme improves transport and application performance. The measured end-to-end goodput is linked to the dropping/marking policy of the AQM scheme -- e.g., the fewer the number of packet drops, the fewer packets need retransmission, minimizing the impact of AQM on transport and application performance. Additionally, an AQM scheme may resort to Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) marking as an initial means to control delay. Again, marking packets instead of dropping them reduces the number of packet retransmissions and increases goodput. End-to-end goodput values help to evaluate the AQM scheme's effectiveness in minimizing packet drops that impact application performance and to estimate how well the AQM scheme works with ECN.</t>

        <t>The measurement of the goodput allows the tester to evaluate to
	what extent an AQM is able to maintain a high bottleneck
	utilization. This metric should also be obtained frequently during an
	experiment, as the long-term goodput is relevant for steady-state
	scenarios only and may not necessarily reflect how the introduction of
	an AQM actually impacts the link utilization during a certain
	period of time. Fluctuations in the values obtained from these
	measurements may depend on other factors than the introduction of an
	AQM, such as link-layer losses due to external noise or corruption,
	fluctuating bandwidths (IEEE 802.11 WLANs), heavy congestion levels, or the
	transport layer's rate reduction by the congestion control mechanism.</t>

	</section>
        <section anchor="subsec:e2e_metrics_latency" title="Latency and Jitter">
          <t>The latency, or the one-way delay metric, is discussed in <xref
	  target="RFC2679"> </xref>. There is a consensus on an adequate
	  metric for the jitter that represents the one-way delay variations
	  for packets from the same flow: the Packet Delay Variation (PDV)
	  serves well in all use cases <xref target="RFC5481"> </xref>.</t>
<t>The end-to-end latency includes components other than just the queuing delay, such as the signal-processing delay, transmission delay, and processing delay. Moreover, the jitter 
   is caused by variations in queuing and processing delay (e.g., 
   scheduling effects). The introduction of an AQM scheme would impact end-to-end latency and jitter, and therefore these metrics should be considered in the end-to-end evaluation of performance.</t>
	</section>

        <section anchor="subsec:e2e_metrics_tradeoff" title="Discussion on the Trade-Off between Latency and Goodput">
<t>The metrics presented in this section may be considered in order to discuss and quantify the trade-off between latency and goodput.</t>

<t>With regards to the goodput, and in addition to the long-term stationary
goodput value, it is recommended to take measurements at every multiple of the
minimum RTT (minRTT) between A and B. 


It is suggested to take measurements at
least every K * minRTT (to smooth out the fluctuations), with K=10. Higher
values for K can be considered whenever it is more appropriate for the
presentation of the results, since the value for K may depend on the network's
path characteristics. The measurement period must be disclosed for each
experiment, and when results/values are compared across different AQM schemes,
the comparisons should use exactly the same measurement periods. With regards
to latency, it is recommended to take the samples on a per-packet basis
whenever possible, depending on the features provided by the hardware and software and the impact of sampling itself on the hardware performance.</t>
<t>From each of these sets of measurements, the cumulative density function
(CDF) of the considered metrics should be computed. If the considered scenario
introduces dynamically varying parameters, temporal evolution of the metrics
could also be generated. For each scenario, the following graph may be
generated: the x-axis shows a queuing delay (that is, the average per-packet delay in excess of minimum RTT), the y-axis the goodput. Ellipses are computed as detailed in <xref target="WINS2014"></xref>: "We take each individual [...] run [...] as one point, and then compute the 1-epsilon elliptic contour of the maximum-likelihood 2D Gaussian distribution that explains the points. [...] we plot the median per-sender throughput and queueing delay as a circle. [...] The orientation of an ellipse represents the covariance between the throughput and delay measured for the protocol." This graph provides part of a better understanding of (1) the delay/goodput trade-off for a given congestion control mechanism (<xref target="sec:perf"></xref>), and (2) how the goodput and average queue delay vary as a function of the traffic load (<xref target="subsec:stability_tests"></xref>).</t>

            <t>AQM schemes need to be compared against both performance and deployment categories. In addition, this section details how best to achieve a fair comparison of AQM schemes by avoiding certain pitfalls.</t>
            <section anchor="subsubsec:discussion_comp_aqm_perf" title="Performance Comparison">
              <t>AQM schemes should be compared against the generic scenarios that are summarized in <xref target="sec:conclusion"></xref>. AQM schemes may be compared for specific network environments such as data centers, home networks, etc. If an AQM scheme has parameter(s) that were externally tuned for optimization or other purposes, these values must be disclosed.</t>
              <t>AQM schemes belong to different varieties such as
	      queue-length based schemes (for example, RED) or queuing-delay based
	      scheme (for example, CoDel, PIE). AQM schemes expose different control knobs associated with different semantics. For example, while both PIE and CoDel are queuing-delay based schemes and each expose a knob to control the queuing delay -- PIE's "queuing delay reference" vs. CoDel's "queuing delay target", the two tuning parameters of the
          two schemes have different semantics, resulting in different control
          points. Such differences in AQM schemes can be easily overlooked while making comparisons.</t>
              <t>This document recommends the following procedures for a fair performance comparison between the AQM schemes: </t>
              <t> <list style="numbers">
                  <t>Similar control parameters and implications: Testers
		  should be aware of the control parameters of the different
		  schemes that control similar behavior. Testers should also
		  be aware of the input value ranges and corresponding
		  implications. For example, consider two different schemes --
		  (A) queue-length based AQM scheme, and (B) queuing-delay
		  based scheme. A and B are likely to have different kinds of
		  control inputs to control the target delay -- the target
		  queue length in A vs. target queuing delay in B, for
		  example. Setting parameter values such as 100 MB for A vs. 10
		  ms for B will have different implications depending on evaluation context. Such context-dependent implications must be considered before drawing conclusions on performance comparisons. Also, it would be preferable if an AQM proposal listed such parameters and discussed how each relates to network characteristics such as capacity, average RTT, etc.</t>
                  <t>Compare over a range of input configurations: There could
		  be situations when the set of control parameters that affect
		  a specific behavior have different semantics between the two
		  AQM schemes. As mentioned above, PIE has tuning parameters
		  to control queue delay that have different semantics from
		  those used in CoDel. In such situations, these schemes need
		  to be compared over a range of input configurations. For
		  example, compare PIE vs. CoDel over the range of target delay input configurations.</t>

            <t>An AQM scheme may be considering packet sizes while generating
	    congestion signals <xref target="RFC7141"></xref>. For example,
	    control packets such as DNS requests/responses, TCP SYNs/ACKs are
	    small, but their loss can severely impact application
	    performance. An AQM scheme may therefore be biased towards small
	    packets by dropping them with lower probability compared to larger
	    packets. However, such an AQM scheme is unfair to data senders
	    generating larger packets. Data senders, malicious or otherwise,
	    are motivated to take advantage of such an AQM scheme by
	    transmitting smaller packets, and this could result in unsafe

            <t>An AQM scheme should adhere to the recommendations outlined in

In order to evaluate if an AQM scheme is biased towards flows with smaller size packets, traffic can be generated, as defined in <xref target="subsubsec:stability_tests_net_mild"></xref>, where half of the flows have smaller packets (e.g., 500-byte packets) than the other half of the flow (e.g., 1500-byte packets). In this case, the metrics reported could be the same as in <xref target="subsubsec:rtt_fariness_metrics"></xref>, where Category I is the set of flows with smaller packets and Category II the one with larger packets.

<t>The scheduling and the AQM conjointly impact the end-to-end
performance. Therefore, the AQM proposal must discuss the feasibility of adding scheduling combined with the AQM algorithm. It can be explained whether the dropping policy is applied when packets are being enqueued or dequeued.</t>
          
<t>These guidelines do not propose guidelines to assess the performance of
scheduling algorithms. Indeed, as opposed to characterizing AQM schemes that
is related to their capacity to control the queuing delay in a queue,
characterizing scheduling schemes is related to the scheduling itself and its
interaction with the AQM scheme. As one example, the scheduler may create
sub-queues and the AQM scheme may be applied on each of the sub-queues,
and/or the AQM could be applied on the whole queue. Also, schedulers might,
such as FQ-CoDel <xref target="HOEI2015"></xref> or FavorQueue <xref

        <section anchor="sec:perf" title="Transport Protocols">

            <t>Network and end-devices need to be configured with a reasonable amount of buffer space to absorb transient bursts. In some situations, network providers tend to configure devices with large buffers to avoid packet drops triggered by a full buffer and to maximize the link utilization for standard loss-based TCP traffic.</t> 

      <t>AQM algorithms are often evaluated by considering the Transmission Control
      Protocol (TCP) <xref target="RFC0793"></xref> with a limited number of
      applications. TCP is a widely deployed transport. It fills up available buffers
      until a sender transferring a bulk flow with TCP receives a signal
      (packet drop) that reduces the sending rate. The larger the buffer, the higher
      the buffer occupancy, and therefore the queuing delay. An efficient AQM scheme
      sends out early congestion signals to TCP to bring the queuing delay under
      control.</t>

      <t>Not all endpoints (or applications) using TCP use the same flavor of
      TCP. A variety of senders generate different classes of traffic, which may not
      react to congestion signals (aka non-responsive flows in Section 3 of the AQM recommendation document <xref
      target="RFC7567"></xref>) or may not reduce their sending
      rate as expected (aka Transport Flows that are less responsive than TCP, such as proposed in Section 3 of the AQM recommendation document <xref
      target="RFC7567"></xref>, also called "aggressive flows").
      In these cases, AQM schemes seek to control the queuing delay.</t>

            <t>An AQM scheme's congestion signals (via drops or ECN marks) must reach the transport sender so that a responsive sender can initiate its congestion control mechanism and adjust the sending rate. This procedure is thus dependent on the end-to-end path RTT. When the RTT varies, the onset of congestion control is impacted, and in turn impacts the ability of an AQM scheme to control the queue. It
        is therefore important to assess the AQM schemes for a set of RTTs between A and B
        (e.g., from 5 to 200 ms).</t>
            <t>The asymmetry in terms of difference in intrinsic RTT between
	    various paths sharing the same bottleneck should be considered, so
	    that the fairness between the flows can be discussed. In this
	    scenario, a flow traversing on a shorter RTT path may react faster to congestion and recover faster from it compared to another flow on a longer RTT path. The introduction of AQM schemes may potentially improve the RTT fairness.</t>
            <t>Introducing an AQM scheme may cause unfairness between the flows, even if the RTTs are identical. This potential unfairness should be investigated as well.</t>

          <section anchor="subsec:burst_absorption_motivation" title="Motivation">
        <t>An AQM scheme can face bursts of packet arrivals due to
        various reasons. Dropping one or more packets from a burst can result
        in performance penalties for the corresponding flows, since dropped
        packets have to be retransmitted. Performance penalties can result in
        failing to meet Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and can be a disincentive to AQM adoption.</t>

        <t>The ability to accommodate bursts translates to larger queue length
        and hence more queuing delay. On the one hand, it is important that an
        AQM scheme quickly brings bursty traffic under control. On the other
        hand, a peak in the packet drop rates to bring a packet burst quickly
        under control could result in multiple drops per flow and severely
        impact transport and application performance. Therefore, an AQM scheme
        ought to bring bursts under control by balancing both aspects -- (1)

        ongoing flows in terms of packet drops are minimized.</t>

        <t>An AQM scheme that maintains short queues allows some remaining
        space in the buffer for bursts of arriving packets. The tolerance to
        bursts of packets depends upon the number of packets in the queue,
        which is directly linked to the AQM algorithm. Moreover, an AQM
        scheme may implement a feature controlling the maximum size of
        accepted bursts that can depend on the buffer occupancy or the
        currently estimated queuing delay. The impact of the buffer size on
        the burst allowance may be evaluated.</t>

          <t>One of the biggest hurdles of RED deployment was/is its parameter sensitivity to operating conditions -- how difficult it is to tune RED parameters for a deployment to achieve acceptable benefit from using RED. Fluctuating congestion levels and network conditions add to the complexity. Incorrect parameter values lead to poor performance.</t>
          <t>Any AQM scheme is likely to have parameters whose values affect the control law and behavior of an AQM. Exposing all these parameters as control parameters to a network operator (or user) can easily result in an unsafe AQM deployment. Unexpected AQM behavior ensues when parameter values are set improperly. A minimal number of control parameters minimizes the number of ways a user can break a system where an AQM scheme is deployed at. Fewer control parameters make the AQM scheme more user-friendly and easier to deploy and debug.</t>
          <t>"AQM algorithms SHOULD NOT require tuning of initial or configuration
      parameters in common use cases." such as stated in Section 4 of the AQM recommendation document <xref target="RFC7567"></xref>. A scheme ought to expose only those
