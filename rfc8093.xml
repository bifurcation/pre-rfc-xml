                This document requests IANA to mark BGP path attribute
                values 30, 31, 129, 241, 242, and 243 as "Deprecated".

        <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
            <t>
                It has been discovered that certain BGP Path Attribute values
                have been used in BGP implementations that have been deployed
                in the wild while not being assigned by IANA for such
                usage. Unregistered usage of BGP Path Attribute values can lead to
                deployment problems for new technologies.
            </t>
            <t>
                The use of these unregistered values was noticed when the BGP Large
                Communities attribute <xref target="RFC8092"/>
                was initially assigned value 30 by IANA. It was subsequently
                discovered that a widely deployed <xref target="RFC4271">BGP-4</xref>
                implementation had released code that used path attribute 30
                and that applied a <xref target="RFC7606">"Treat-as-withdraw"</xref>
                strategy to routes containing a valid Large Community
                attribute, since it was expecting a different data structure.
                Because these routes were dropped, early adopters of Large
                Communities were unreachable from parts of the Internet. As a
                workaround, a new Early IANA Allocation was requested.
            </t>
            <t>
                The squatting of values 30, 31, 129, 241, 242, and 243 has been
                confirmed by the involved vendors or through source code
                review.
            </t>

        <section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
            <t>
                IANA has marked values 30, 31,
                129, 241, 242, and 243 as "Deprecated" in the "BGP Path
                Attributes" subregistry under the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
                Parameters" registry. The marking "Deprecated" means "use is not
                recommended" (<xref target="IANA-GUIDELINES" />).
            </t>

        <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
                There are no meaningful security consequences arising from this
                registry update.

<abstract><t>Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants to identify various protocol parameters.  To ensure that the values used in these fields do not have conflicting uses, and to promote interoperability, their allocation is often coordinated by a central record keeper.  For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  To make assignments in a given registry prudently, IANA needs guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made.  This document defines a framework for the documentation of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the guidance given to IANA is clear and addresses the various issues that are likely in the operation of a registry.  This is the third edition of this document; it obsoletes RFC 5226.</t></abstract>
