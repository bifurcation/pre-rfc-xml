         functions in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label

      <t>MPLS and GMPLS networks may be constructed from layered service
         networks.  It is advantageous for overall network efficiency to

         through a process called inter-layer traffic engineering.  PCE is a
         candidate solution for such requirements.</t>

  <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

     <t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in <xref target="RFC4655" />
        is an entity that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a
        network graph and applying computational constraints.  A Path Computation
        Client (PCC) may make requests to a PCE for paths to be computed, and a PCE
        may initiate or modify services in a network by supplying new paths
        <xref target="RFC8231" /> <xref target="RFC8281"/>.</t>

     <t>A network may comprise multiple layers.  These layers may represent
        separation of technologies (e.g., packet switch capable (PSC), time
        division multiplex (TDM), and lambda switch capable (LSC)) <xref target="RFC3945" />;
        separation of data-plane switching granularity levels (e.g., Virtual Circuit 4 (VC4) and VC12)
        <xref target="RFC5212" />; or a distinction between client and server networking
        roles (e.g., commercial or administrative separation of client and server networks).
        In this multi-layer network, Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in lower layers are used to
        carry higher-layer LSPs.  The network topology formed by lower-layer LSPs and
        advertised as traffic engineering links (TE links) in the higher layer is called a
        Virtual Network Topology (VNT) <xref target="RFC5212"/>.  Discussion of other ways
        that network layering can be supported such that connectivity in a higher-layer
        network can be provided by LSPs in a lower-layer network is provided in
        <xref target="RFC7926" />.</t>

     <t>It is important to optimize network resource utilization globally,
        i.e., taking into account all layers, rather than optimizing resource
        utilization at each layer independently.  This allows better network
        efficiency to be achieved.  This is what we call inter-layer traffic
        engineering.  This includes mechanisms allowing the computation of
        end-to-end paths across layers (known as inter-layer path
        computation) and mechanisms for control and management of the VNT by
        setting up and releasing LSPs in the lower layers <xref target="RFC5212" />.</t>

     <t>PCE can provide a suitable mechanism for resolving inter-layer path
        computation issues.  The framework for applying the PCE-based path
        computation architecture to inter-layer traffic engineering is
        described in <xref target="RFC5623" />.</t>

     <t>The PCE communication protocol (PCEP) is designed as a communication
        protocol between PCCs and PCEs and is defined in <xref target="RFC5440" />.  A set of
        requirements for PCEP extensions to support inter-layer traffic
        engineering is described in <xref target="RFC6457" />.</t>

     <t>This document presents PCEP extensions for inter-layer traffic
        engineering that satisfy the requirements described in <xref target="RFC6457" />.</t>

  <section anchor="overview" title="Overview of PCE-Based Inter-Layer Path Computation">

     <t><xref target="RFC4206" /> defines a way to signal a higher-layer LSP, which has an
        explicit route that includes hops traversed by LSPs in lower layers.
        The computation of end-to-end paths across layers is called inter-layer
        path computation.</t>

     <t>A Label Switching Router (LSR) in the higher layer might not have
        information on the lower-layer topology, particularly in an overlay
        or augmented model <xref target="RFC3945" />; hence, it may not be able to compute an
        end-to-end path across layers.</t>

     <t>PCE-based inter-layer path computation consists of using one or more
        PCEs to compute an end-to-end path across layers.  This could be
        achieved by relying on a single PCE that has topology information
        about multiple layers and can directly compute an end-to-end path
        across layers considering the topology of all of the layers.
        Alternatively, the inter-layer path computation could be performed
        using multiple cooperating PCEs where each PCE has information about
        the topology of one or more layers (but not all layers) and where the
        PCEs collaborate to compute an end-to-end path.</t>

     <t>As described in <xref target="RFC5339" />, a hybrid node may advertise a single TE
        link with multiple switching capabilities.  Normally, those TE links exist at
        the layer/region boarder.  In this case, a PCE needs to be
        capable of specifying the server-layer path information when the
        server-layer path information is required to be returned to the PCC.</t>

     <t><xref target="RFC5623" /> describes models for inter-layer path computation in more
        detail.  It introduces the Virtual Network Topology Manager (VNTM), a functional
        element that controls the VNT, and sets out three distinct models (and a fourth
        hybrid model) for inter-layer control involving a PCE, triggered signaling,
        and a Network Management System (NMS).</t>

  </section>

  <section anchor="protext" title="Protocol Extensions">

     <t>This section describes PCEP extensions for inter-layer path
        computation.  Four new objects are defined: the INTER-LAYER object,
        the SWITCH-LAYER object, the REQ&nbhy;ADAP&nbhy;CAP object, and the SERVER-
        INDICATION object.  Also, two new metric types are defined.</t>

        <section anchor="interlayerObj" title="INTER-LAYER Object">

           <t>The INTER-LAYER object is optional and can be used in Path Computation Request (PCReq) and Path Computation Reply (PCRep) messages, and also in Path Computation State Report (PCRpt), Path Computation Update Request (PCUpd), and Path Computation LSP Initiate Request (PCInitiate) messages.</t>

           <t>In a PCReq message, the INTER-LAYER object indicates whether inter-layer
              path computation is allowed, the type of path to be computed,
              and whether triggered signaling (hierarchical LSPs per <xref target="RFC4206" /> or
              stitched LSPs per <xref target="RFC5150" /> depending on physical network
              technologies) is allowed.  When the INTER-LAYER object is absent from
              a PCReq message, the receiving PCE MUST process as though inter-layer
              path computation had been explicitly disallowed (I-bit set to zero --
              see below).</t>

           <t>In a PCRep message, the INTER-LAYER object indicates whether inter&nbhy;layer
              path computation has been performed, the type of path that has
              been computed, and whether triggered signaling is used.</t>

           <t>When a PCReq message includes more than one request, an INTER-LAYER
              object is used per request.  When a PCRep message includes more than
              one path per request that is responded to, an INTER-LAYER object is
              used per path.</t>
 
           <t>The applicability of this object to PCRpt and PCUpd messages is the same as for
              other objects on those messages as described in
              <xref target="RFC8231" />.  The applicability of
              this object to the PCInitiate message is the same as for other
              objects on those messages as described in
              <xref target="RFC8281" />.  These messages use
              the &lt;attribute-list&gt; as defined in <xref target="RFC5440" />
              and extended by further PCEP extensions, so the &lt;attribute-list&gt;
              as extended in <xref target="updates" /> can be used to include the
              INTER-LAYER object on these messages.</t>

           <t>INTER-LAYER Object-Class is 36.</t>
	   <t>Inter-layer Object-Type is 1.</t>

           <t>The format of the INTER-LAYER object body is shown in
              <xref target="interlayerFig" />.</t>

           <t>I flag (1 bit): The I flag is used by a PCC in a PCReq message to
              indicate to a PCE whether an inter-layer path is allowed.  When the I
              flag is set (one), the PCE MAY perform inter-layer path computation
              and return an inter-layer path.  When the flag is clear (zero), the
              path that is returned MUST NOT be an inter-layer path.</t>

           <t>The I flag is used by a PCE in a PCRep message to indicate to a PCC
              whether the path returned is an inter-layer path.  When the I flag is
              set (one), the path is an inter-layer path.  When it is clear (zero),
              the path is contained within a single layer because either inter-
              layer path computation was not performed or a mono-layer path
              (without any virtual TE link and without any loose hop that spans the
              lower-layer network) was found notwithstanding the use of inter-layer
              path computation.</t>

           <t>M flag (1 bit): The M flag is used by a PCC in a PCReq message to
              indicate to a PCE whether a mono-layer path or multi-layer path is
              requested.  When the M flag is set (one), a multi-layer path is
              requested.  When it is clear (zero), a mono-layer path is requested.</t>

           <t>The M flag is used by a PCE in a PCRep message to indicate to a PCC
              whether a mono-layer path or multi-layer path is returned.  When the M flag
              is set (one), a multi-layer path is returned.  When the M flag is clear (zero),
              a mono-layer path is returned.</t>

           <t>If the I flag is clear (zero), the M flag has no meaning and MUST be
              ignored.</t>

           <t><xref target="RFC6457" /> describes two sub-options for mono-layer path.
              <list style="symbols">
                 <t>A mono-layer path that is specified by strict hops.  The path may
                    include virtual TE links.</t>

                 <t>A mono-layer path that includes loose hops that span the lower-
                    layer network.</t>
              </list></t>

           <t>The choice of this sub-option can be specified by the use of the O flag
              in the Request Parameter (RP) object specified in <xref target="RFC5440" />.</t>

           <t>T flag (1 bit): The T flag is used by a PCC in a PCReq message to
              indicate to a PCE whether triggered signaling is allowed.  When the T
              flag is set (one), triggered signaling is allowed.  When it is clear
              (zero), triggered signaling is not allowed.</t>

           <t>The T flag is used by a PCE in a PCRep message to indicate to a PCC
              whether triggered signaling is required to support the returned path.
              When the T flag is set (one), triggered signaling is required.  When
              it is clear (zero), triggered signaling is not required.</t>

           <t>Note that triggered signaling is used to support hierarchical
              <xref target="RFC4206" /> or stitched <xref target="RFC5150" /> LSPs
              according to the physical attributes of the network layers.</t>

           <t>If the I flag is clear (zero), the T flag has no meaning and MUST be
              ignored.</t>

           <t>Note that the I and M flags differ in the following ways.  When
              the I flag is clear (zero), virtual TE links must not be used in path
              computation.  In addition, loose hops that span the lower-layer
              network must not be specified.  Only regular TE links from the same
              layer may be used.

              <list style="symbols">

                 <t>When the I flag is set (one), the M flag is clear (zero), and the T
                    flag is set (one), virtual TE links are allowed in path computation.
                    In addition, when the O flag of the RP object is set, loose hops that
                    span the lower-layer network may be specified.  This will initiate
                    lower-layer LSP setup; thus, the inter-layer path is set up even though the
                    path computation result from a PCE to a PCC includes hops from the
                    same layer only.</t>

                 <t>However, when the I flag is set (one), the M flag is clear (zero),
                    and the T flag is clear (zero), since triggered signaling is not
                    allowed, virtual TE links that have not been pre-signaled MUST NOT
                    be used in path computation.  In addition, loose hops that span the
                    lower-layer network MUST NOT be specified.  Therefore, this is
                    equivalent to the I flag being clear (zero).</t>

              </list></t>

           <t>Reserved bits of the INTER-LAYER object sent between a PCC and PCE in the
              same domain MUST be transmitted as zero and SHOULD be ignored on receipt.
              A PCE that forwards a path computation request to other PCEs MUST preserve
              the settings of reserved bits in the PCReq messages it sends and in the PCRep
              messages it forwards to PCCs.</t>

           <t>Note that the flags in the PCRpt message indicate the state of an LSP,
              whereas the flags in the PCUpd and the PCInitiate messages indicate
              the intended/desired state as determined by the PCE.</t>

        </section>

        <section anchor="switchlayerObj" title="SWITCH-LAYER Object">

           <t>The SWITCH-LAYER object is optional on a PCReq message and specifies
              switching layers in which a path MUST, or MUST NOT, be established.  A
              switching layer is expressed as a switching type and encoding type.</t>

           <t>When a SWITCH-LAYER object is used on a PCReq, it is interpreted in
              the context of the INTER-LAYER object on the same message.  If no
              INTER-LAYER object is present, the PCE MUST process the SWITCH-LAYER
              object as though inter-layer path computation had been explicitly
              disallowed.  In such a case, the SWITCH-LAYER object MUST NOT have
              more than one LSP Encoding Type and Switching Type with the I flag
              set.</t>

           <t>The SWITCH-LAYER object is optional on a PCRep message, where it is
              used with the NO-PATH object in the case of unsuccessful path
              computation to indicate the set of constraints that could not be
              satisfied.</t>

           <t>The SWITCH-LAYER object may be used on a PCRpt message consistent with
              how properties of existing LSPs are reported on that message
              <xref target="RFC8231" />.  The PCRpt message uses
              the &lt;attribute-list&gt; as defined in <xref target="RFC5440" /> and
              extended by further PCEP extensions.  This message can use the
              &lt;attribute-list&gt; as extended in <xref target="updates" /> to carry
              the SWITCH-LAYER object.  The SWITCH-LAYER object is not used on a PCUpd

           <t>A PCC requests or allows inter-layer path computation in a PCReq
              message by including the INTER-LAYER object with the I flag set.  The
              INTER-LAYER object indicates whether inter-layer path computation is
              allowed, which path type is requested, and whether triggered
              signaling is allowed.</t>

           <t>The SWITCH-LAYER object, which MUST NOT be present unless the INTER-
              LAYER object is also present, is optionally used to specify the
              switching types and encoding types that define layers that must, or
              must not, be used in the computed path.  When the SWITCH-LAYER object
              is used with the INTER-LAYER object I flag clear (zero), inter-layer
              path computation is not allowed, but constraints specified in the
              SWITCH-LAYER object apply.  Example usage includes path computation in
              a single-layer GMPLS network.</t>

           <t>The REQ-ADAP-CAP object is optionally used to specify the interface
              switching capability of both ends of the lower-layer LSP.  The REQ&nbhy;ADAP&nbhy;CAP
              object is used in inter-PCE communication, where the PCE
              that is responsible for computing higher-layer paths makes a request
              as a PCC to a PCE that is responsible for computing lower-layer paths.
              Alternatively, the REQ-ADAP-CAP object may be used in the NMS-VNTM
              model, where the VNTM makes a request as a PCC to a PCE that is
              responsible for computing lower-layer paths.</t>

           <t>The METRIC object is optionally used to specify metric types to be
              optimized or bounded.  When metric type 18 is used, it
              indicates that path computation MUST minimize or bound the number of
              adaptations on a path.  When metric type 19 is used, it
              indicates that path computation MUST minimize or bound the number of
              layers to be involved on a path.</t>

           <t>Furthermore, in order to allow different Objective Functions (OFs) to be
              applied within different network layers, multiple OF objects
              <xref target="RFC5541" /> MAY be present.  In such a case, the first
              OF object specifies an objective function for the higher-layer network,
              and subsequent OF objects specify objection functions of the subsequent
              lower-layer networks.</t>

        <section anchor="pcrep" title="Path Computation Reply">

           <t>In the case of successful path computation, the requested PCE replies
              to the requesting PCC for the inter-layer path computation result in
              a PCRep message that MAY include the INTER-LAYER object.  When the
              INTER-LAYER object is included in a PCRep message, the I, M,
              and T flags indicate semantics of the path as described in <xref target="interlayerObj" />.
              Furthermore, when the C flag of the METRIC object in a PCReq is set,
              the METRIC object MUST be included in the PCRep to provide the
              computed metric value, as specified in <xref target="RFC5440" />.</t>

           <t>The PCE MAY specify the server-layer path information in the ERO.  In this
              case, the requested PCE replies with a PCRep message that includes at
              least two sets of ERO information in the path-list: one is for the
              client-layer path information, and another one is the server-layer
              path information.  When SERVER-INDICATION is included in a PCRep
              message, it indicates that the path in the ERO is the server-layer
              path information.  The server-layer path specified in the ERO could be
              loose or strict.  On receiving the replied path, the PCC (e.g., NMS and
              ingress node) can trigger the signaling to set up the LSPs according
              to the computed paths.</t>

           <t>In the case of unsuccessful path computation, the PCRep message also
              contains a NO-PATH object, and the SWITCH-TYPE object and/or REQ&nbhy;ADAP&nbhy;CAP
              MAY be used to indicate the set of constraints that could
              not be satisfied.</t>

              PCRpt message to allow a PCC to report to a PCE that an LSP already
              exists in the network and to delegate control of that LSP to the PCE.</t>

           <t>When the LSP is a multi-layer LSP (or a mono-layer LSP for which
              specific adaptations exist), the message objects defined in this

              to the PCE so that the PCE may process the LSP.</t>

           <t>Furthermore, <xref target="RFC8231" /> defines the
              PCUpd message to allow a PCE to modify an LSP that has been delegated to
              it.  When the LSP is a multi-layer LSP (or a mono-layer LSP for which
              specific adaptations exist), the message objects defined in this document

           <t>Processing for PCE-initiated LSPs is described in
              <xref target="RFC8281" />.  That document defines
              the PCInitiate message that is used by a PCE to request a PCC to set up a
              new LSP.  When the LSP is a multi-layer LSP (or a mono-layer LSP for
              which specific adaptations exist), the message objects defined in
              this document are used on the PCInitiate to describe the attributes of
              the new LSP.</t>

           <t>The new metric types defined in this document can also be used with
              the stateful PCE extensions.  The format of PCEP messages described

        described in <xref target="RFC7420" />.  Systems that already use a MIB
        module to manage their PCEP implementations might want to augment that
        module to provide controls and indicators for support of inter-layer
        features defined in this document and to add counters of messages sent
        and received containing the objects defined here.</t>

     <t>However, the preferred mechanism for configuration is through a YANG
        model.  Work has started on a YANG model for PCEP
        <xref target="PCEP-YANG" />, and this could be enhanced as
        described for the MIB module, above.</t>

     <t>Additional policy configuration might be provided to allow a PCE to
        discriminate between the computation services offered to different
        PCCs.</t>

     <t>A set of monitoring tools for the PCE-based architecture are provided
        in <xref target="RFC5886" />.  Systems implementing this specification and PCE
        monitoring should consider defining extensions to the mechanisms
        defined in <xref target="RFC5886" /> to help monitor inter-layer path computation
        requests.</t>

  <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

     <t>Inter-layer traffic engineering with PCE may raise new security
        issues when PCE-PCE communication is done between different layer
        networks for inter-layer path computation.  Security issues may also
        exist when a single PCE is granted full visibility of TE information
        that applies to multiple layers.</t>

     <t>The Path-Key-based mechanism defined in <xref target="RFC5520" /> MAY be applied to
        address the topology confidentiality between different layers.</t>
