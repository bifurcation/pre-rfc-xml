        <section title="Introduction">

<t>
The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops
designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the
Internet and to suggest future directions for the Internet
architecture.  This long-term planning function of the IAB is
complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working
groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), under the
leadership of the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) and area
directorates.
</t>
<t>
Today's Internet is experienced by users as a set of applications, such as email, instant messaging, and services on the Web. &nbsp;While these applications do not require users to be present at the time of service execution, in many cases they are. There are also substantial differences in performance among the various end devices, but in general end devices participating in the Internet are considered to have high performance.
</t>
<t>
There are, however, a large number of deployed embedded devices, and there is
substantial value in interconnecting them with the Internet. The term "Internet
of Things" denotes a trend where a large number of devices employ communication
services offered by the Internet protocols. Many of these devices are not
directly operated by humans, but exist as components in buildings or vehicles,
or are spread out in the environment. There is a large variation in the computing power, available memory, (electrical) power, and communications bandwidth between different types of devices.
</t>
<t>
Many of these devices offer a range of new possibilities or provide additional value for previously unconnected devices. Some devices have been connected using proprietary communication networks in the past but are now migrating to the use of the Internet Protocol suite in order to share the same communication network between all applications and to enable rich communications services.
</t>
<t>
Much of this development can simply run on existing Internet protocols. For instance, home entertainment and monitoring systems often offer a Web interface to the end user. In many cases the new, constrained environments can benefit from additional protocols and protocol extensions that help optimize the communications and lower the computational requirements. Examples of currently ongoing standardization efforts targeted for these environments include the Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE), IPv6 over Low power WPAN (6LoWPAN), Routing Over Low power and Lossy networks (ROLL), and the Light-Weight Implementation Guidance (LWIG) working groups of the IETF.
</t>
<t>
This workshop explored the experiences of researchers and developers when considering the characteristics of constrained devices. Engineers know that many design considerations need to be taken into account when developing protocols and architecture. Balancing between the conflicting goals of code size, economic incentives, power consumption, usability, and security is often difficult, as illustrated by Clark et al. in "Tussle in Cyberspace: Defining Tomorrow's Internet" <xref target="Tussle"/>.
</t>
<t>
Participants at the workshop discussed the experience and approaches taken when designing protocols and architectures for interconnecting smart objects to the Internet. The scope of the investigations included constrained nodes as well as constrained networks. 
</t>
<t>
The call for position papers suggested investigating the area of integration with the Internet in the following categories:<list style="symbols">
<t>Scalability</t>
<t>Power efficiency</t>
<t>Interworking between different technologies and network domains</t>
<t>Usability and manageability</t>
<t>Security and privacy</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>The goals of the workshop can be summarized as follows:

<list style="empty"> 
<t>As many deployed smart objects demonstrate, running protocols like the Internet Protocol Version 4 <xref target="RFC0791"/> and Version 6 <xref target="RFC2460"/>, the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) <xref target="RFC0768"/>, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) <xref target="RFC0793"/>, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) <xref target="RFC2616"/>, etc., on constrained devices is clearly possible. Still, protocol designers, system architects, and developers have to keep various limitations in mind. The organizers were interested to discuss the experience with deploying IETF protocols in different constrained environments.</t>
<t>
Furthermore, the organizers were seeking to identify issues either where current implementers do not yet have solutions or where researchers predict potential issues. 
</t>
<t>
The workshop served as a venue to identify problems and to discover common interests that may turn into new work or into changes in direction of already ongoing work at the IETF and or the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).

<section anchor="constraint" title="Constrained Nodes and Networks">
<t>
The workshop was spurred by the increasing presence of constrained devices on the network. It is quite natural to ask how these limitations impact the design of the affected nodes. Note that not all nodes suffer from the same set of limitations.
</t>
<t><list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Energy constraints:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
 Since wireless communication can be a large portion of the power budget for
wireless devices, reducing unnecessary communication can significantly increase
the battery life of a low-end device. The choice of low-power radio can also
significantly impact the overall energy consumption, as can sleeping
periodically, when the device is not in use. In some cases, these nodes will
only wake periodically to handle needed communications. This constraint is
quite in contrast to the "always on" paradigm found in regular Internet hosts. Even in the case of non-battery operated devices, power is a constraint with respect to energy efficiency goals.</t>

<t hangText="Bandwidth constraints:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>

Various low-power radio networks offer only limited bandwidth, and show high
packet loss as well as high link quality variability.  The data transmission
rates vary from 20 to 900 kilobits per second (e.g., in the case of IEEE 802.15.4). Nodes may be used in usually highly unstable radio environments. The physical-layer packet size may be limited (~100 bytes).</t>

<t hangText="Memory constraints:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>The amount of
volatile and persistent storage impacts the program execution and has important
implications for the functionality of the protocol stack. The Arduino UNO
board, for example, provides a developer with 2 KB RAM and 32 KB flash memory (without any extensions, such as microSD cards).</t>
</list> 
</t>

<t>A system designer also needs to consider CPU constraints, which often relate
to energy constraints: a processor with lower performance consumes less
energy. As described later in this document, the design of the mainboard may
allow certain components to be put to sleep to further lower energy
consumption. In general, embedded systems are often purpose built with only the
hardware components needed for the given task, while general-purpose personal
computers are less constrained with regard to their mainboard layout and
typically offer a huge number of  optional plug-in peripherals to be
connected. A factor that also has to be taken into consideration is the
intended usage environment. For example, a humidity sensor deployed outside a
building may need to deal with temperatures from -50 degrees C to +85 degrees
C. &nbsp;There are often physical size limitations for smart objects. While traditional
mainboards are rather large, such as the Advanced Technology eXtended (ATX)
design with a board size of 305 x 244 mm available in many PCs or the mini-ITX
design typically found in home theater PCs with 170 x 170 mm, mainboard layouts
for embedded systems are typically much smaller, such as the CoreExpress layout
with 58 x 65 mm, or even smaller. In addition to the plain mainboard, additional sensors, peripherals, a power adapter/battery, and a case have to be taken into consideration. Finally, there are cost restrictions as well.
</t>
<t>
The situation becomes more challenging when not only the hosts are constrained but also the network nodes themselves.
</t>

<t>While there are constantly improvements being made, Moore's law tends to
  be less effective in the embedded system space than in personal computing
  devices: gains made available by increases in transistor count and
  density are more likely to be invested in reductions of cost and
  power requirements than into continual increases in computing power.
</t>
</section> 

        <!-- ******************************************************************************** -->


<section title="Workshop Structure">

<t>With the ongoing work on connecting smart objects to the Internet, there are many challenges the workshop participants raised in more than 70 accepted position papers. With a single workshop day, discussions had to be focused, and priority was given to those topics that had been raised by many authors. A summary of the identified issues are captured in the subsections below.</t>

<section title="Architecture">

<t>A number of architectural questions were brought up in the workshop. This is
natural, as the architectural choices affect the required technical solutions
and the need for standards. At this workshop, questions regarding the separation
of traffic, the need for profiling for application-specific domains, the demand
for data-model-specific standardization, as well as the design choices regarding the
layer at which functionality should be put were discussed and are briefly
summarized below. </t> 

<section title="One Internet vs. Islands">

<t>Devices that used to be in proprietary or application-specific networks are today migrating to IP networks.
 There is, however, the question of whether these smart objects are now on the
same IP network as any other application. Controlled applications, like the
fountains in front of the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas that are operated as a
distributed control system <xref target="Dolin"/>, probably are not exchanging
their control messages over the same network that is also used by hotel guests
for their Internet traffic. The same had been argued for smart grids, which are
described as follows in <xref target="SmartGrid"/>:

<list>
<t>A smart grid is a digitally enabled electrical grid that gathers,
distributes, and acts on information about the behavior of all participants
(suppliers and consumers) in order to improve the efficiency, reliability,
economics, and sustainability of electricity services.
</t></list>

The question that was raised during the workshop is, therefore, in what sense
are we talking about one Internet or about using IP technology for a separate,
"walled garden" network that is independent of the Internet?</t> 

<t>Cullen Jennings compared the current state of smart object deployment with
the evolution of Voice over IP (VoIP): "Initially, many vendors recommended to run VoIP over a separate VLAN or a separate infrastructure. Nobody could imagine how to make the type of real-time guarantees, how to debug it, and how to get it to work because the Internet is not ideally suited for making any types of guarantees for real-time systems.  As time went on, people got better at making voice work across that type of IP network. They suddenly noticed that having voice running on a separate virtual network than their other applications was a disaster. They couldn't decide if a PC was running a softphone and whether it went on a voice or a data network. At that point, people realized that they needed a converged network and all moved to one. I wouldn't be surprised to see the same happen here. Initially, we will see very separated networks. Then, those will be running over the same hardware to take advantage of the cost benefits of not having to deploy multiple sets of wires around buildings. Over time, there will be strong needs to directly communicate with each other. We need to be designing the system for the long run. Assume everything will end up on the same network even if you initially plan to run it in separate networks."</t>

<t>It is clearly possible to let sensors in a building communicate through the wireless access points and through the same infrastructure used for Internet access, if you want to. Those who want separation at the physical layer can do so as well. What is important is to make sure that these different deployment philosophies do not force loss of interoperability.</t> 

<t>The level of interoperability that IP accomplished fostered innovation at the application layer. Ralph Droms reinforced this message by saying: "Bright people will take a phone, build an application and connect it, with the appropriate security controls in place, to the things in my house in ways we have never thought about before. Otherwise, we are just building another telephone network."</t>

</section> 

<section title="Domain-Specific Stacks and Profiles">

<t>Imagine a building network scenario where a new light bulb is installed that should, out of the box without further configuration, interoperate with the already present light switch from a different vendor in the room. For many, this is the desired level of interoperability in the area of smart object design. To accomplish this level of interoperability, it is not sufficient to provide interoperability only at the network layer. Even running the same transport protocol and application-layer protocol (e.g., HTTP) is insufficient since both devices need to understand the semantics of the payloads for "Turn the light on" as well.</t>

<t>Standardizing the entire protocol stack for this specific "light switch /
light bulb" scenario is possible. A possible stack would, for example, use IPv6
with a specific address configuration mechanism (such as stateless address
autoconfiguration), a network access authentication security mechanism such as
Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA) <xref
target="RFC5191"/>, a service discovery mechanism (e.g., multicast DNS with
DNS-Based Service Discovery <xref target="DNS-SD"/>), an application-layer protocol, for example, Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) <xref target="CoAP"/> (which uses UDP), and the syntax and semantic for the light on/off functionality.</t>
<t>As this list shows, there is already some amount of protocol functionality
that has to be agreed on by various stakeholders to make this scenario work
seamlessly. As we approach more complex protocol interactions, the
functionality quickly becomes more complex: IPv4 and IPv6 on the network layer,
various options at the transport layer (such as UDP, TCP, the Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP) <xref target="RFC4960"/>, and the Datagram
Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) <xref target="RFC4340"/>), and there are
plenty of choices at the application layer with respect to communication
protocols, data formats and data models. Different requirements have led to the
development of a variety of communication protocols: client-server protocols in
the style of the original HTTP, publish-subscribe protocols (like the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261"/> or Extensible Messaging and
Presence Protocol (XMPP) <xref target="RFC6121"/>), and store-and-forward messaging (borrowed from the delay tolerant networking community). Along with the different application-layer communication protocols come various identity and security mechanisms.</t>

<t>With the smart object constraints, it feels natural to develop these stacks since each application domain (e.g., healthcare, smart grids, building networking) will have their unique requirements and their own community involved in the design process. How likely are these profiles going to be the right match for the future, specifically for the new innovations that will come? How many of these stacks are we going to have? Will the differences in the profiles purely be the result of different requirements coming from the individual application domains or will these mismatches reflect the spirit, understanding, and preferences of the community designing them? How many stacks will multipurpose devices have to implement?</t>

<t>Standardizing profiles independently for each application is not the only option. Another option is to let many different applications utilize a common foundation, i.e., a protocol stack that is implemented and utilized by every device. This, however, requires various application domains to be analyzed for their common characteristics and to identify requirements that are common across all of them. The level of difficulty for finding an agreement of how such a foundation stack should look depends on how many layers it covers and how lightweight it has to be.</t>

<t>From the discussions at the workshop, it was clear that the available options are not ideal and further discussions are needed.</t>

</section> 

<section title="Which Layer?">

<t>The end-to-end principle states that functionality should be put into the end points instead of into the networks. An additional recommendation, which is equally important, is to put functionality higher up in the protocol stack. While it is useful to make common functionality available as building blocks to higher layers, the wide range of requirements by different applications led to a model where lower layers provide only very basic functionality and more sophisticated features were made available by various applications. Still, there has been the desire to put application-layer functionality into the lower layers of the networking stack. A common belief is that performance benefits can be gained if functionality is placed at the lower layers of the protocol stack. This new functionality may be offered in the form of a gateway, which bridges different communication technologies, acts on behalf of other nodes, and offers more generic functionality (such as name-based routing and caching).</t>

<t>Two examples of functionality offered at the network layer and discussed during the workshops were location and name-based routing:
<list style="hanging"> 
<t hangText="Location:"><vspace blankLines="1"/> The notion of location gives each network node the understanding of proximity (e.g., 'I am a light bulb and in the same room as the light switch.'). Today, a router may provide information as to whether other nodes belong to the same subnet or they may provide location information (for example, in the form of GPS-based coordinates). However, providing a sense of the specific environment (e.g., a room, building, campus, etc.) is not possible without manual configuration. While it has been a desirable feature for many ubiquitous computing applications to know this type of information and to use it for richer application-layer interactions, widespread deployment has not happened yet.
<vspace blankLines="1"/> </t>
<t hangText="Name-Based Routing:"><vspace blankLines="1"/> 
 With the work on recent "clean slate" architecture proposals, such as named
data networking, flexible naming concepts are being researched to allow
application developers to express their application-layer concepts in a way
that they can be used natively by the underlying networking stack without
translation. For example, Jeff Burke provided the example of his work in a
theater with a distributed control system of technical equipment (such as
projectors, dimmers, and light systems). Application developers name their
equipment with human-readable identifiers, which may change after the end of a
rehearsal, and address them using these names. These naming concepts based on
variable-length strings
 raise questions regarding scalability.</t>

</list> 
</t>

<t>The workshop participants were not able to come to an agreement about what functionality should be moved from the application layer to the network layer.</t>

</section> 

    </section> 
    
<section title="Sleeping Nodes"> 

<t>One limitation of smart objects is their available energy.  To extend
   battery life, for example, of a watch battery or single AAA battery
   for months, these low-power devices have to sleep 99% to
   99.5% of their time.  For example, a light sensor may only wake up 
   to check whether it is nighttime to turn on light bulbs.  
   Most parts of
   the system, particularly communication components, are put into a 
   sleeping state (e.g., WLAN radio interface) and selected components, 
   such as sensors, periodically check for relevant events
   and, if necessary, turn on other hardware modules.  Every bit
   is precious, as is every round trip and every millisecond of radio
   activity.
</t>
<t>
   Many IETF protocols are implicitly designed to be always on, i.e., 
   the protocol implementation waits for and reacts to incoming messages, and 
   may maintain session state (at various layers of the stack). These 
   protocols work well when energy consumption is not a concern and 
   when receiving and sending messages happen at a low cost.
    It should
   be understood that energy is consumed both in transmitting
   messages (and often more importantly) in keeping the receiver
   awake. Allowing devices to sleep most of the time preserves energy but creates
challenges for protocol designs.
</t>
<t>The inherent issue encountered by a stationary node resuming from 
   sleep is that another node may have chosen the same address while 
   the node was asleep. A number of steps have to be taken before sending 
   a packet. A new address may have to be obtained, for example using the 
   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or stateless
   address autoconfiguration.  Optionally, Detecting Network Attachment (DNA)
   procedures (see <xref target="RFC4436"/> and <xref target="RFC6059"/>) can be used to 
   shorten the setup time by noticing that the node is using the same
   default gateway. 
</t>   
<t>
   The issue with a mobile node that is sleeping is that the node may 
   have been moved to another network (e.g., a sleeping laptop being 
   transported to a new environment) where on resumption it may discover 
   that its address has become invalid. 
</t>

<t>The following design considerations should be taken into account when
energy efficiency is a concern:
<list style="numbers"> 

<t>Rethink the Always-On Assumption<vspace blankLines="1"/> 
 
       When designing a protocol that assumes that the nodes are always
       on, alternatives need to be considered.  This could involve
       eliminating functionality (e.g., not implementing DNA or duplicate
       address detection) or considering the use of a sleep proxy. 
       While sleep proxies (e.g., proxZzzy(TM) <xref target="proxZzzy"/>) enable periodic messages 
       to be sent on behalf of sleeping nodes, this approach assumes 
       that energy management constraints do not apply to the sleep proxy,
       which may not always be the case (e.g., if the entire network is
       deployed in the field without access to power). Yet another option
       is for devices to explicitly communicate sleep cycles so that they
       can only check for messages periodically (be it measured in milliseconds, 
       seconds, or hours).  This is the approach taken in IEEE 802.11, which
       supports multiple energy conservation mechanisms designed to enable
       a station to spend a large fraction of the time sleeping. 
</t>
<t>Reduce Network Attachment Costs<vspace blankLines="1"/>
 
       As noted above, the procedures for obtaining an address and
       assuring its uniqueness can be costly.  In a network where
       nodes spend a large fraction of the time sleeping, but are
       not necessarily mobile, are all of these procedures really
       necessary?<vspace blankLines="1"/>

       Can we find ways to reduce the number of protocol interactions
       without sacrificing correctness? The main focus of past 
       investigations has been on IPv6 and ND, but other protocols do 
       also deserve a deeper investigation, such as DNS and DHCP.
 </t>
 
 <t>Avoid Verbose Protocols<vspace blankLines="1"/>

       Protocols involving multiple roundtrips and/or
       lengthy messages with verbose encodings (e.g., XML) are not always
well-suited for constrained environments. Low-power nodes utilizing
       verbose protocols have to use more energy in sending messages and 
       have to stay powered on for a longer period of time as they wait 
       for the multi-roundtrip protocol exchanges to complete.  
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
       The best way to address these problems is to ensure
       that the simplest possible protocol exchanges are used when the
       protocols in question are designed.  In some cases,
       alternative encoding formats and compression may also help.
</t>

<t>Think about System-Wide Efficiency<vspace blankLines="1"/>

       While energy efficiency is critical for low-power devices running on
       batteries, it is also beneficial for other devices
       as well, including notebook computers, desktop computers, and smartphones.  However,
       if the goal is energy efficiency as opposed to battery life
       extension for low-power devices, then it is important to consider 
       the total energy consumption of all the elements of the system.  
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
       For example, consider energy consumption in a home environment. 
       In these scenarios it is important to evaluate the energy usage
       of the entire system. A light bulb utilizing Internet technology 
       described in this document may use less power but
       there is also the device that controls the bulb that may consume 
       a lot of energy. If the goal is to reduce overall energy usage,
       then it is important to consider these two devices (and potentially 
       many others) together.

<section anchor="security" title="Security">

<t>In the development of smart object applications, as with any other protocol application solution,  security has to be considered early in the design process. As such, the recommendations currently provided to IETF protocol architects, such as RFC 3552 <xref target="RFC3552"/> and RFC 4101 <xref target="RFC4101"/>, apply also to the smart object space.</t>

<t>While there are additional constraints, as described in <xref
target="constraint"/>, security has to be a mandatory part of the solution. The
hope is that this will lead to implementations that provide security features,
deployments that utilize them, and finally use of better security
mechanisms. It is important to point out that the lack of direct user
interaction will place hard requirements on deployment models, configuration
mechanisms, and software upgrade / crypto&nbhy;agility mechanisms.
</t>

<t>Since many of the security mechanisms allow for customization, particularly
with regard to the cryptographic primitives utilized, many believe that IETF
security solutions are usable without modifications in a large part of the
smart object domain. Others call for new work on cryptographic primitives that
make use of a single primitive (such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
<xref target="AES"/>) as a building block for all cryptographic functions. The
benefit would be a smaller footprint of the overall solution, specifically with respect to hardware limitations (e.g., the hardware architecture of certain embedded devices prevents pipelining from being used). In the excitement for new work on optimizations of cryptographic primitives, other factors have to be taken into consideration that influence successful deployment, such as widespread support in libraries, as well as intellectual property rights (IPR). As an example of the latter aspect, the struggle of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)-based cryptographic algorithms <xref target="ECC"/> to find deployment can partially be attributed to its IPR situation. The reuse of libraries providing cryptographic functions is clearly an important way to use available memory resources in a more efficient way. To deal with the performance and footprint concerns, investigations into offloading certain resource-hungry functions to parties that possess more cryptographic power have been considered. For example, the ability to delegate certificate validation to servers has been standardized in the IETF before, for the support of the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) in the Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) and in Transport Layer Security (TLS); see <xref target="RFC4806"/> and <xref target="RFC5246"/>, respectively.
</t>
<t>Focusing only on the cryptographic primitives would be shortsighted; many would argue that this is the easy part of a smart object security solution. Key management and credential enrollment, however, are considered a big challenge by many, particularly when usability requirements have to be taken into account. Another group
  of challenges concern privacy; with smart grids, for example, some have voiced concerns
  regarding the ability of third parties to keep track of an individual's energy consumption (and
  draw associated conclusions). As another example, it is easy to see how a
scale that is connected to the Internet for uploading weight information to a
social network could lead to privacy concerns. While security mechanisms that
are used to offer protection of the communication between different parties also provide a certain degree of privacy protection, they are clearly not enough to address all concerns. Even with the best communication security  and access control mechanisms in place, one still needs additional safeguards against the concerns mentioned in the examples.</t>

<t>While better deployment of security protocols on the entire Internet would
be very desirable, practical considerations regarding usability and the incentives of the stakeholders involved have often lead to slower adoption.</t>
</section> 

<section title="Routing">

<t>A smart object network environment may also employ routers under similar
constraints as the end devices. Currently two approaches to routing in these
low-power and lossy networks are under consideration -- namely, mesh-under and
route-over. The so-called "mesh-under" approach places routing functions at the
link layer, and consequently all devices appear as immediate neighbors at the
network layer. With the "route-over" approach, routing is done in the IP layer
and not at all in the link layer. Each physical hop appears as a single IP hop
(ignoring devices that just extend the physical range of signaling, such as
repeaters). Routing in this context means running a routing protocol. The IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL) <xref target="RPL"/>, for example, belongs to the route-over category. <!-- Trill is an example of a mesh-under approach. -->
</t>
<t>From an architectural point of view there are several questions that arise from where routing is provided, for example:
<list style="symbols">
<t>Protocols often assume that link characteristics are predictable when communicating with any device attached to the same link. Latency, throughput, and reliability may vary considerably between different devices that are multiple link-layer hops away. What timeout should be used? What happens if a device is unreachable? In case of default router selection, two advertised routers may be a different number of hops away. Should a device have visibility into the path to make a decision, and what path characteristics would be useful to have?</t> 
<t>Scoped message delivery to a neighboring IP hop (via link-local addressing) allows certain types of IP protocols to communicate with their immediate neighbors and to therefore scope their recipients. A link-local multicast message will be received by all nodes in the same IP link-local realm unless some special optimizations are provided by the link layer.</t>
<t>When path computations are done at the link layer as well as on the network layer, then what coordination needs to take place? </t>
</list>
</t>
<t>When multiple different link-layer technologies are involved in a network design, routing at layer 3 has to be provided in any case. <xref target="IoT-ARCH"/> talks about these tradeoffs between route-over and mesh-under in detail. Furthermore, those who decide about the deployment have to determine how to connect smart objects to the Internet infrastructure, and a number of wired and wireless technologies may be suitable for a specific deployment. Depending on the chosen technologies the above-mentioned mesh-under vs. route-over approach will have to be decided, and further decisions will have to be made about the choice of a specific routing protocol.</t>
<t>
In 2008, the IETF formed the Routing Over Low power and Lossy networks (ROLL)
working group to specify a routing solution for smart object
environments. During its first year of existence, the working group studied
routing requirements in detail (see <xref target="RFC5867"/>, <xref
target="RFC5826"/>, <xref target="RFC5673"/>, and <xref target="RFC5548"/>),
and it worked on a protocol survey comparing a number of existing routing protocols, including Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV)-style protocols <xref target="RFC3561"/>, against the identified requirements. The protocol survey <xref target="PROT-SURVEY"/> was inconclusive and abandoned without giving rise to publication of 
	an RFC.</t>
<t>The ROLL WG concluded that a new routing protocol satisfying the documented requirements has to be developed and the work on RPL was started as the IETF routing protocol for smart object networks. Nevertheless, controversial discussions at the workshop about which routing protocols is best in a given environment are still ongoing. Thomas Clausen, for example, argued for using an AODV-like routing protocol in <xref target="Clausen"/>.</t>

        <!-- ******************************************************************************** -->

<section title="Conclusions and Next Steps">

<t>The workshop allowed the participants to be exposed to interesting
applications and their requirements (buildings, fountains, theater, etc.), to
have discussions about radically different architectures and their issues
(e.g., information centric networking), to look at existing technology from a
new angle (sleeping nodes, energy consumption), to focus on some details of the protocol stack (neighbor discovery, security, routing) and to learn about implementation experience. </t>
<t>One goal of the workshop was to identify areas that require further investigation. The list below reflects the thoughts of the workshop participants as expressed on the day of the workshop. Note that the suggested items concern potential work by the IETF and the IRTF, and the order does not imply a particular preference.</t>
<t> <list style="hanging">
 
<t hangText="Security:"><vspace blankLines="1"/> 
A discussion of security is provided in <xref target="security"/>. In general, security-related protocol exchanges and the required amount of computational resource requirements can contribute significantly to the overall processing. Therefore, it remains a challenge to accomplish performance improvements without sacrificing the overall security level, taking the usability of the entire system into consideration.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
Another challenge is how to balance the security and
performance needs of smart objects with the interoperability
requirements of hosts on the Internet since different suites
of algorithms tend to be chosen for these different
environments. This involves trade-offs between performance on
the smart objects versus end-to-end security. Solutions
that mandate a "trusted" middlebox whose only role is to
terminate security associations tend to be frowned upon
from the security perspective, especially since end users of
challenged devices (where those exist) are unlikely to
understand the security consequences of such middleboxes.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
The discussion concluded with the following recommendations: 
<list style="symbols"> 
<t>Investigate usability in cryptographic protocol design with regard to
credential management. As an example, the Bluetooth pairing mechanism was
mentioned as a simple and yet reasonably secure method of introducing devices
into a new environment. In fact, the IETF working group Credential and
Provisioning (ENROLL) was established years ago to deal with residential networks but was terminated prematurely due to lack of progress. The email archive still exists and is available <xref target="ENROLL"/> and may provide useful historical information.</t>
<t>Standardized authentication and key exchange mechanisms should be surveyed
for suitability in smart object environments with respect to message size,
computational performance, number of messages, code size, and main memory
requirements. A starting point of such an investigation (in the case of IKEv2) was provided by Tero Kivinen with <xref target="MINIMAL-IKEv2"/>, and a suitable venue for discussion could be the recently established Light-Weight Implementation Guidance (LWIG) working group <xref target="LWIG"/>.</t>
<t>Research has to be done in the area of lightweight cryptographic primitives
-- namely, block ciphers, stream ciphers, and cryptographic hash
functions. It's worthwhile to mention the early work with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) new cryptographic hash algorithm 'SHA-3' competition <xref target="SHA3"/>. A suitable forum for discussion is the IRTF Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) <xref target="CFRG"/>.</t>
</list> 
The difficulty and impact of choosing specialized algorithms for
smart objects should not be underestimated. Issues that arise
include the additional specification complexity (e.g., TLS already
has hundreds of ciphersuites defined, most of which are unused in
practice), the long latency in terms of roll out (many hosts are
still using deprecated algorithms 5-10 years after those algorithms
were deprecated), and the barriers that IPR-encumbered schemes
present to widespread deployment. While research on this topic
within CFRG and the cryptographic research community is a very
worthwhile goal, any such algorithms will likely have to offer
very significant benefits before they will be broadly adopted.
20% less CPU usage is unlikely to be a winning argument no matter what
an algorithm inventor believes.
</t> 

<t hangText="Energy Design Considerations:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
One part of the workshop was focused on the discussion of energy implications for IETF protocol design with proposals being made about how to extend protocols to better support nodes that are mostly sleeping. Discussions are encouraged to take place on the RECIPE mailing list <xref target="RECIPE"/>. The workshop position paper <xref target="Wasserman"/> by Margaret Wasserman provides a good starting point for further investigations.</t>

<t hangText="Information-/Content-Centric Networking:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
Information/Content Centric Networking is about accessing named content, and a number of research projects have emerged around this theme. At this point in time, the work is not yet ready for standardization in the IETF. Instead, the formation of an IRTF research group has been proposed, and more details are available on the IRTF DISCUSS mailing list <xref target="irtf-discuss"/>.
</t>
<t hangText="Architectural Guidelines:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
 Participants suggested developing an architectural write-up about what can be done with the IETF protocols we have today and how these different elements may be combined to offer an explanation for the broader community. This would be a task for the IAB. An example of prior work that serves as input is <xref target="RFC6272"/>.</t>
<t hangText="Network Management:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
 While this topic did not make it onto the workshop agenda, it was considered
useful to start a discussion about how to implement network management
protocols, such as Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) <xref
target="RFC6241"/>, on smart objects. The following position papers may be
useful as a starting point for further discussions: <xref target="Ersue"/> and
<xref target="Schoenwaelder"/>. An IETF draft documnet is also available: <xref
target="SNMP-OPT"/>.</t> 

<t hangText="Congestion Control:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
When smart objects transmit sensor readings to some server on the Internet, these protocol interactions often carry a small amount of data and happen infrequently, although regularly. With the work on new application protocols, like CoAP <xref target="CoAP"/>, the question of whether a congestion control mechanism should be used at the underlying transport protocol or by the application protocol itself arises. <xref target="CoAP-CC"/> is a starting point for CoAP, but further work is needed.</t>
 
<t hangText="Data Models:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
Standardization of application-layer protocols is important but does not ensure that, for example, a light switch and a light bulb are able to interact with each other. One area where participants saw the need for further work was in the area of data models. While prior IETF standardization work on, for example, location <xref target="GEOPRIV"/> can be reused, the question was raised where the IETF should focus its standardization efforts since domain expertise in each area will be needed. As a potential example, energy pricing was discussed, with an example provided by <xref target="ENERGY-PRICING"/>.</t>

<t hangText="Building Networking:"> <vspace blankLines="1"/> 
Network architectures in residential as well as commercial buildings should take the presence of 
smart objects and dedicated subnetworks focusing on smart objects into account. A new working group, Home Networking (HOMENET) <xref target="HOMENET"/>, was created after the workshop to look at this topic.</t>

<t hangText="Discovery:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
Additional extensions to developed discovery protocols, such as multicast DNS
(mDNS), may be needed for the smart object environment. For instance, the
HOMENET working group wants
to extend current discovery protocols to work across multiple subnets.
Smart object networks are often organized in separate subnets, so these
extensions may be useful in that environment as well.
</t>

<t hangText="Routing:"><vspace blankLines="1"/> 
Changing radio conditions and link fluctuation may lead to the need for renumbering. Workshop participants argued that work should be started on the multi-link subnetworks to mitigate this problem, i.e., to extend the notion of a subnet to be able to span multiple links. With the publication of RFC 4903 <xref target="RFC4903"/>, the Internet Architecture Board had looked into this topic already and provided pros and cons.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
The applicability of specific routing protocols designed for smart object networks needs further investigation. The ROLL working group is chartered with the task of constructing an applicability document for RPL, for instance.

<abstract><t>Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of network in which both the routers and their interconnect are constrained.  LLN routers typically operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power).  Their interconnects are characterized by high loss rates, low data rates, and instability.  LLNs are comprised of anything from a few dozen and up to thousands of routers. Supported traffic flows include point-to-point (between devices inside the LLN), point-to-multipoint (from a central control point to a subset of devices inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point).  This document specifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL), which provides a mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point traffic from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point, as well as point-to- multipoint traffic from the central control point to the devices inside the LLN, is supported.  Support for point-to-point traffic is also available.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>The IETF ROLL Working Group has specified a routing protocol designed for the Low power and Lossy Networks (LLN) also referred to as IP smart objects networks or the "Internet of things".  Still, the debate of where routing functions should occur within the network stack tend to get revived on a regular basis.  A mesh-under approach places routing functions in the link layer to emulate a single broadcast domain where all devices appear as immediate neighbors to the network layer.  In contrast, a route-over approach places all routing functions at the network layer, following the IP architecture.  For LLNs, a mesh-under approach may seem simple and attractive because it seeks to hide characteristics of multi-hop communication through the LLN from the network layer.  However, resource constraints and dynamic link characteristics limit to what extent link-layer routing can hide those characteristics.  This document presents architectural issues of using a mesh-under approach in LLNs and how a route-over approach does not suffer from these issues.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>Low-power wireless devices, such as sensors, actuators and smart    objects, present difficult constraints: very limited memory, little processing power, and long sleep periods. As most of these devices are battery-powered, energy efficiency is critically important. Wireless link qualities can vary significantly over time, requiring protocols to make agile decisions yet minimize topology change energy costs.  Routing over such low power and lossy networks introduces requirements that existing routing protocols may not fully address. Using existing application requirements documents, this document derives a minimal and not exhaustive set of criteria for routing in low-power and lossy networks.  It provides a brief survey of the strengths and weaknesses of existing protocols with respect to these criteria.  From this survey it examines whether existing and mature IETF protocols can be used without modification in these networks, or whether further work is necessary.  It concludes that no existing IETF protocol meets the requirements of this domain.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>This document specifies how DNS resource records are named and structured to facilitate service discovery. Given a type of service that a client is looking for, and a domain in which the client is looking for that service, this allows clients to discover a list of named instances of that desired service, using standard DNS queries. This is referred to as DNS-based Service Discovery, or DNS-SD.</t></abstract>
