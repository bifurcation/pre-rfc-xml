    <abstract>
      <t>The policy defined in RFC 6761 for IANA registrations in the "Special-Use Domain Names" registry 
      has been shown, through experience, to present challenges that were not anticipated when RFC 6761 was written.
      This memo presents a list, intended to be comprehensive, of the problems 
      that have since been identified. In addition, it reviews the history of domain
      names and summarizes current IETF publications and some publications
      from other organizations relating to Special-Use Domain Names.</t>

<t>This document should be considered required reading for IETF participants who wish to express an informed opinion on the topic of Special-Use Domain Names.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>One of the key services required to use the Internet is name
      resolution. Name resolution is the process of translating a symbolic
      name into some object or set of objects to which the name refers, most
      typically one or more IP addresses. These names are often referred to as
      "domain names". When reading this document, care must be taken not to
      assume that the term domain name implies the use of the <xref
      target="RFC1034">Domain Name System</xref> for resolving these names. An
      excellent presentation on this topic can be found in <xref
      target="DOMAIN-NAMES">Domain Names</xref>.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC6761">"Special-Use Domain Names"</xref> created the <xref
      target="SDO-IANA-SUDR">"Special-Use Domain
      Names" IANA registry</xref>, defined policies for adding to the registry, and made some
      suggestions about how those policies might be implemented. Since the
      publication of RFC 6761, the IETF has been asked to designate several
      new Special-Use Domain Names in this registry. During the evaluation
      process for these Special-Use Domain Names, the IETF encountered several
      different sorts of issues. Because of this, the IETF has decided to
      investigate the problem and decide if and how the process defined in RFC 6761 can
      be improved, or whether it should be deprecated. The IETF DNSOP Working
      Group charter was extended to include conducting a review of the process
      for adding names to the registry that is defined in RFC 6761. This
      document is a product of that review.</t>

      <t>Based on current ICANN and IETF practice, including RFC 6761, there
      are several different types of names in the root of the Domain
      Namespace: <list style="symbols">
          <t>Names reserved by the IETF for technical purposes</t>

          <t>Names assigned by ICANN to the public DNS root; some names reserved by
          the IETF for technical purposes may appear in the global DNS root
          for reasons pertaining to the operation of the DNS</t>

        <t>ICANN Reserved Names; names that may not be applied for as TLDs
          (see "Reserved Names" and "Treatment of 
Country or Territory Names" (Sections 2.2.1.2.1 and 2.2.1.4.1, 
respectively) of <xref target="SDO-ICANN-DAG"/>).</t>

          <t>Names used by other organizations without following established
          processes</t>

          <t>Names that are unused and are available for assignment to one of
          the previous categories</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This document presents a list, derived from a variety of sources,
      including discussion in the IETF DNSOP Working Group, of the problems associated
      with the assignment of Special-Use Domain Names. The list is intended to
      be an unfiltered compilation of issues. In support of its analysis of
      the particular set of issues described here, the document also includes
      descriptions of existing practice as it relates to the use of domain
      names, a brief history of domain names, and some observations by various
      IETF participants who have experience with various aspects of the
      current situation.</t>

    <section title="Problems Associated with Special-Use Domain Names" anchor="prob_special-use_domain_names">
      <t>This section presents a list of problems that have been identified
      with respect to the assignment of Special-Use Domain Names. Solutions to
      these problems, including their costs or trade-offs, are out of scope for
      this document and will be covered in a separate document. New problems
      that might be created in the process of solving problems described in
      this document are also out of scope: these problems are expected to be
      addressed in the process of evaluating potential solutions.</t>

      <t>Special-Use Domain Names exist to solve a variety of problems. This
      document has two goals: enumerate all of the problems that have been
      identified to which Special-Use Domain Names are a solution and
      enumerate all of the problems that have been raised in the process of
      trying to use RFC 6761 as it was intended. As some of those problems may
      fall into both categories, this document makes no attempt to categorize
      the problems.</t>

      <t>There is a broad diversity of opinion about this set of problems. Not
      every participant agrees that each of the problems enumerated in this
      document is actually a problem. This document takes no position on the
      relative validity of the various problems that have been enumerated, nor
      on the organization responsible for addressing each individual problem,
      if it is to be addressed. This document only
      enumerates the problems, provides the reader with context for thinking
      about them, and provides a context for future discussion of solutions,
      regardless of whether such solutions may work for IETF, ICANN, IANA,
      or some other group.</t>

      <t>The list of problems is not presented in order of importance; numbers are assigned so that each problem can easily be referenced by number, not to indicate priority.  The list of problems is as follows:

          <list
          style="numbers">
          <t>Although the IETF and ICANN have a liaison relationship through
          which special-use allocations can be discussed, there exists no
          formal process for coordinating these allocations (see <xref
          target="MoU"/>). The lack of coordination complicates the management
          of the root of the Domain Namespace and <xref
          target="SDO-ICANN-SAC090"> could lead to conflicts in name
          assignments </xref>.</t>

          <t>There is no explicit scoping as to what can constitute a <xref
          target="RFC2860">"technical use"</xref> and what cannot; there
          is also no consensus within the IETF as to what this term means.</t>

          <t>Not all developers of protocols on the Internet agree that
          authority over the entire Domain Namespace should reside solely with
          the IETF and ICANN.</t>

          <t>Although the IETF and ICANN nominally have authority over this
          namespace, neither organization can enforce that authority over any
          third party who wants to just start using a subset of the namespace.
          Such parties may observe that the IETF has never asserted control or
          authority over what protocols are "allowed" on the Internet, and
          that the principle of "permissionless innovation" suggests there
          should be a way for people to include new uses of domain names in
          new protocols and applications.</t>

          <t>Organizations do in fact sometimes use subsets of the Domain
          Namespace without following established processes. Reasons a third
          party might do this include: <list style="numbers">

              <t>Lack of knowledge that a process exists for assigning such names.</t>

              <t>Intended use is covered by the gTLD process <xref
              target="SDO-ICANN-DAG"/>, but no gTLD process is ongoing.</t>

              <t>Intended use is covered by the gTLD process, but the third party
              doesn't want to pay a fee.</t>

              <t>Intended use is covered by some IETF process, but the third
              party doesn't want to follow the process.</t>

              <t>Intended use is covered by an ICANN or IETF process, but the third
              party expects that the outcome will be refusal or non-action.</t>

              <t>Lack of knowledge that a name intended to be used only locally may
              nevertheless leak.</t>

              <t>Lack of knowledge that a name used locally with informal allocation may
              subsequently be allocated formally, creating operational
              problems.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>There is demand for more than one name resolution protocol for
          domain names. Domain names contain no metadata to indicate which
          protocol to use to resolve them. Domain name resolution APIs do not
          provide a way to specify which protocol to use.</t>

          <t>When a Special-Use Domain Name is added to the "Special-Use Domain
          Names" registry, not all software that processes such names will
          understand the special use of that name. In many cases, name
          resolution software will use the Domain Name System for resolution
          of names not known to have a special use. Consequently, any such use
          will result in queries for Special-Use Domain Names being sent to
          Domain Name System authoritative servers. These queries may
          constitute an operational problem for operators of root zone
          authoritative name servers. These queries may also inadvertently
          reveal private information through the contents of the query, which
          is a privacy consideration.</t>

<t>Some protocol developers have assumed that they could not succeed in getting a name assigned through the IETF using the process defined in RFC 6761.   This is because when the IETF has attempted to follow the process defined in RFC 6761, it has been slow and uncertain.  For example, the process of assigning the first new name ('.local') using the process defined in RFC 6761 took more than ten years from beginning to end: longer
          by a factor of ten than any other part of the protocol development
          process (largely because this ten years included time to develop the
          process as well as use it). Other uses of the process have proceeded
          more smoothly, but there is a reasonably justified perception that
          using this process is likely to be slow and difficult, with an
          uncertain outcome.</t>

          <t>There is strong resistance within the IETF to assigning domain
          names to resolution systems outside of the DNS, for a variety of
          reasons: <list style="numbers">

              <t>It requires a mechanism for identifying which set of
              resolution processes is required in order to resolve a
              particular name.</t>

              <t>Assertion of authority: there is a sense that the Domain
              Namespace is "owned" by the IETF or by ICANN, so, if a name
              is claimed without following their processes, the person or entity that
              claimed that name should suffer some consequence that would,
              presumably, deter future circumvention of the official
              processes.</t>

              <t>More than one name resolution protocol is bad, in the sense
              that a single protocol is less complicated to implement and
              deploy.</t>

              <t>The semantics of alternative resolution protocols may differ
              from the DNS protocol; DNS has the concept of RRtypes, whereas other
              protocols may not support RRtypes or may support some entirely
              different data structuring mechanism.</t>

              <t>If there is an IETF process through which a TLD can be
              assigned at zero cost other than time, this process will be used
              as an alternative to the more costly process of getting the name
              registered through ICANN.</t>

              <t>A name might be assigned for a particular purpose when a more
              general use of the name would be more beneficial.</t>

              <t>If the IETF assigns a name that some third party or parties
              believe belongs to them in some way, the IETF could become
              embroiled in an expensive dispute with those parties.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>If there were no process for assigning names for technical use
          through the IETF, there is a concern that protocols that require
          such names would not be able to get them.</t>

          <t>In some cases where the IETF has made assignments through the process defined in RFC
          6761, technical mistakes have been made due to
          misunderstandings as to the actual process that RFC 6761 specifies
          (e.g., treating the list of suggested considerations for assigning a
          name as a set of requirements, all of which must be met). In other
          cases, the IETF has made de facto assignments of Special-Use Domain
          Names without following the process in RFC 6761 (see <xref
          target="RFC7050"/> and <xref target="RFC7788"/>).</t>

          <t>There are several Top-Level Domain Names that are in use without due
          process for a variety of purposes. The status of these names need to
          be clarified and recorded to avoid future disputes about their use
          <xref target="SDO-ICANN-COLL"/>.</t>

          <t>In principle, the process defined in RFC 6761 could be used to document the
          existence of domain names that are not safe to assign and provide
          information on how those names are used in practice. However,
          attempts to use RFC 6761 to accomplish this documentation have not
          been successful (for example, see "Additional Reserved Top Level
          Domains" <xref target="RESERVED-TLDS"/> and
          <xref target="addl-tlds"/> of this document). One side effect of the lack of
          documentation is that any mitigation effect on the root name servers
          or on privacy considerations has been missed.</t>

          <t>A domain name can be identified as either a DNS name by placing
          it in the DNS zone(s) or a Special-Use Domain Name by adding it
          to the IANA registry. Some names are in both places; for example,
          some locally served zone names are in DNS zones and documented in
          the "Special-Use Domain Names" registry. At present, the only way a
          domain name can be added to the "Special-Use Domain Name" registry is
          for the IETF to take responsibility for the name and designate it
          for "technical use". There are other potential uses for domain names
          that should be recorded in the registry, but for which the IETF
          should not take responsibility.</t>

          <t>In some cases, the IETF may see the need to document that a name
          is in use without claiming that the use of the name is the IETF's
          particular use of the name. No mechanism exists in the current registry to mark
          names in this way.</t>

          <t>During any of the review stages of a
          document, there is no formal process in which a check is made to ensure that the document does
          not unintentionally violate the IETF process for adding Special-Use
          Domain Names to the registry, as was the case, for example, in RFC
          7788 <xref target="RFC7788"/>.</t>

          <t>Use of the registry is inconsistent -- some Special-Use Domain
          Name RFCs specifically add registry entries, some don't; some
          specify how and whether special-use name delegations should be done,
          some don't.</t>

          <t>There exists no safe, non-process-violating mechanism for ad hoc
          assignment of Special-Use Domain Names.</t>

          <t>It is generally assumed that protocols that need a Special-Use
          Domain Name need a mnemonic, single-label, human-readable
          Special-Use Domain Name for use in user interfaces such as command
          lines or URL entry fields. While this assumption is correct in some
          cases, it is likely not correct in all cases, for example, in
          applications where the domain name is never visible to a user.</t>

          <t>RFC 6761 uses the term "domain name" to describe the thing for
          which special uses are registered. This creates a great deal of
          confusion because some readers take "domain name" to imply the use
          of the DNS protocol.</t>

          <t>The use of DNSSEC with Special-Use Domain Names is an open issue.
          There is no consensus or guidance about how to use DNSSEC with
          various classes of Special-Use Domain Names. Considerations in the
          use of DNSSEC with Special-Use Domain Names include: <list
              style="numbers">
              <t>What class of Special-Use Domain Name is under consideration:
              non-DNS, locally served zone, or other?</t>

              <t>Does the Special-Use Domain Name require a delegation in the
              root zone; if so, should that delegation be signed or not? If
              there is no delegation, then this will be treated by validating
              resolvers as a secure denial of existence for that zone. This
              would not be appropriate for a name being resolved using the DNS
              protocol.</t>

              <t>A process would be required through which the IETF can cause
              a delegation in the root zone to be instantiated.</t>

              <t>What are the recommended practices for using DNS with the
              specific Special-Use Domain Name?</t>
            </list></t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The above list represents the current understanding
      of the authors as to the complete set of problems that
      have been identified during discussion by the working group on this
      topic. The remainder of this document provides additional context that
      will be needed for reasoning related to these problems.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Existing Practice regarding Special-Use Domain Names" anchor="existing">
      <t>There are three primary (see <xref target="su_pri_docs"/>) and
      numerous secondary (<xref target="su_sec_docs"/>) documents to consider
      when thinking about the Special-Use Domain Names process.</t>

      <t>How names are resolved is ambiguous, in the sense that some names are
      Special-Use Domain Names that require special handling and some names
      can be resolved using the DNS protocol with no special handling.</t>

      <t>The assignment of Internet Names is not under the sole control of any
      one organization. The IETF has authority in some cases, but only with
      respect to "technical uses". At present, ICANN is the designated
      administrator of the root zone; but generally not of zones other than
      the root zone. Neither of these authorities can, in any practical sense,
      exclude the practice of ad hoc use of names. Unauthorized use of domain
      names can be accomplished by any entity that has control over one or
      more name servers or resolvers, in the context of any hosts and services
      that entity operates. It can also be accomplished by authors of software
      who decide that a Special-Use Domain Name is the right way to indicate
      the use of an alternate resolution mechanism.</t>

      <section anchor="su_pri_docs"
               title="Primary Special-Use Domain Name Documents">
        <t>The primary documents are considered primary because they directly
        address the IETF's past thoughts on this topic in a general way, and
        also because they describe what the IETF does in practice.</t>

        <section title="IAB Technical Comment on the Unique DNS Root">
          <t><xref target="RFC2826"></xref> is not an IETF
          consensus document, and it appears to have been written to address a
          different problem than the Special-Use Domain Name problem. However,
          it speaks directly to several of the key issues that must be
          considered, and, coming as it does from the IAB, it is rightly
          treated as having significant authority despite not being an IETF
          consensus document.</t>

          <t>This document should be considered required reading for IETF
          participants who wish to express an informed opinion on the topic of
          Special-Use Domain Names. The main points that appear relevant to
          the Special-Use Domain Names problem are: <list style="symbols">

              <t>The Internet requires a globally unique namespace: a
              namespace in which any given name refers to the same information
              (has the same meaning) no matter who requests that information
              and no matter from which specific name server they request
              it.</t>

              <t>Private networks may operate private namespaces, with names
              that have meanings only locally (within the private network), but they
              still require that names in the public namespace be globally
              unique.</t>

              <t>The <xref target="RFC1035">Domain Name System</xref> is not
              the only protocol that may be used for resolving domain
              names.</t>

              <t>Users cannot be assumed to know how to distinguish between
              symbolic references that have local meaning and references that
              have global meaning. Therefore, users may share references that
              incorporate domain names with no global meaning (for example, a
              URL of 'http://mysite.example.corp', where 'example.corp' is a
              domain used privately and informally as described in <xref
              target="SDO-ICANN-COLL"/>).</t>

              <t>While such a reference in the user's context refers to the object the user wishes to share, when the reference is used in a different context, it could refer either to some different object in the recipient's context or to no object at all. The effect of this reference
              escaping the context in which it is valid is that the user's
              intended communication will not be able to be understood by the
              recipients of the communication.</t></list>

              <list style="empty">
              <t>This same problem can also occur when a single user copies a
              name from one context in which it has one meaning into a
              different context in which it has a different meaning -- for
              example, copying a '.onion' domain name out of a Tor Browser
              <xref target="TOR"/>, where it has meaning, and pasting this
              name into an SSH client that doesn't support connecting over the
              Tor network.
</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>We can summarize the advice in this document as follows: <list
              style="symbols">
              <t>Domain names with unambiguous global meaning are preferable
              to domain names with local meaning that will be ambiguous.
              Nevertheless, both globally meaningful and locally special names
              are in use and must be supported.</t>

              <t>At the time of the writing of this document, the IAB was of
              the opinion that there might well be more than one name
              resolution protocol used to resolve domain names.</t>

        <section title="Special-Use Domain Names">
          <t>The second important document is <xref target="RFC6761">
          "Special-Use Domain Names"</xref>. RFC 6761 represents the current
          IETF consensus on designating and recording Special-Use Domain
          Names. The IETF has experienced problems with the designation
          process described in RFC 6761; these concerns motivate this
          document. Familiarity with RFC 6761 is a prerequisite for having an
          informed opinion on the topic of Special-Use Domain Names.</t>

          <t>RFC 6761 defines two aspects of Special-Use Domain Names:
          designating a domain name to have a special purpose and registering
          that special use in the "Special-Use Domain Names" registry. The
          designation process is defined in a single sentence (RFC 6761,
          <xref target="existing"/>):</t>

          <t><list style="empty">
              <t>If it is determined that special handling of a name is
              required in order to implement some desired new functionality,
              then an IETF "Standards Action" or "IESG Approval" specification
              [RFC5226] MUST be published describing the new
              functionality.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>This sentence requires that any designation of a Special-Use
          Domain Name is subject to the same open review and consensus process
          as used to produce and publish all other IETF specifications.</t>

          <t>The registration process is a purely mechanical process, in which
          the existence of the newly designated Special-Use Domain Name is
          recorded, with a pointer to a section in the relevant specification
          document that defines the ways in which special handling is to be
          applied to the name.</t>

          <t>RFC 6761 provides the process whereby <xref target="RFC6762">
          "Multicast DNS" </xref> designated '.local' as a Special-Use Domain
          Name and included it in the "Special-Use Domain Names" registry. RFC 6761
          also enumerates a set of names that were previously used
          or defined to have special uses prior to its publication. Since there had been no registry for these names prior to the
          publication of RFC 6761, the documents defining these names could
          not have added them to the registry.</t>

          <t>Several important points to think about with
          respect to RFC 6761 are: <list style="symbols">

              <t>A Special-Use Domain Name may be a name that should be
              resolved using the DNS protocol with no special handling. An
              example of this is 'in-addr.arpa' (which is an example of a
              Special-Use Domain Name that is not a TLD).</t>

              <t>A Special-Use Domain Name may be a name that is resolved
              using the DNS protocol and that requires no special handling in the stub
              resolver but that requires special handling in the recursive
              resolver. An example of this would be '10.in-addr.arpa.'.</t>

              <t>A Special-Use Domain Name may be a name that requires special
              handling in the stub resolver. An example would be a Special-Use
              Top-Level Domain Name like '.local', which acts as a signal to
              indicate that the local stub resolver should use a non-DNS
              protocol for name resolution.</t>

              <t>The current IETF consensus (from a process perspective, not
              necessarily from the perspective of what would be consensus if
              the IETF were to attempt to produce a new consensus document) is
              that all of these purposes for Special-Use Domain Names are
              valid.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>In this case, the term "stub resolver" does not mean "DNS protocol
          stub resolver". The stub resolver is the entity within a particular
          software stack that takes a question about a domain name and answers
          it. One way a stub resolver can answer such a question is using the
          DNS protocol; however, it is in the stub resolver (as we are using the
          term here) that the decision as to whether to use a protocol (and if
          so, which protocol) or a local database of some sort is made.</t>

          <t>RFC 6761 does not limit Special-Use Domain Names to TLDs.
          However, at present, all Special-Use Domain Names registered in the
          <xref target="SDO-IANA-SUDR"> "Special-Use Domain Names"
          registry</xref> either are intended to be resolved using the DNS
          protocol, are TLDs, or are both. That is, at present there exist no
          Special-Use Domain Names that require special handling by stub
          resolvers and which are not at the top level of the naming
          hierarchy.</t>

          <t>One point to take from this is that there is already a
          requirement in RFC 6762 that when a stub resolver encounters the
          special label, 'local' as the rightmost label of a domain name, it can only use
          the Multicast DNS (mDNS) protocol to resolve that domain name.</t>

        <section anchor="MoU"
                 title="MoU Concerning the Technical Work of IANA">
          <t>There exists a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) <xref
          target="RFC2860"/> between the IETF and ICANN that discusses how names and
          numbers will be managed through IANA. This document is important to the discussion of
          Special-Use Domain Names because, while it delegates authority for
          managing the DNS Namespace generally to ICANN, it
          reserves to the IETF the authority that is then formalized in RFC 6761.  RFC 2860 specifically states: <list
              style="empty">

              <t>Note that (a) assignments of domain names for technical uses (such as
   domain names for inverse DNS lookup), (b) assignments of specialised
   address blocks (such as multicast or anycast blocks), and (c)
   experimental assignments are not considered to be policy issues, and
   shall remain subject to the provisions of this Section 4.</t></list></t> 

          <t>The above text is an addendum to the following: <list
              style="empty">
              <t>Two particular assigned spaces present policy issues in
              addition to the technical considerations specified by the IETF:
              the assignment of domain names, and the assignment of IP address
              blocks. These policy issues are outside the scope of this
              MOU.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The assignment of names in the DNS root zone,
          and the management of the Domain Namespace, is by default a function that is
          performed by ICANN. However, the MoU specifically exempts domain
          names assigned for technical use and uses the example of domains
          used for inverse DNS lookup. Both 'in-addr.arpa' and 'ip6.arpa' are
          in the "Special-Use Domain Names" registry.</t>

          <t>Implicit in the MoU is the fact that the IETF and ICANN retain,
          between them, sole authority for assigning any names from the Domain
          Namespace. Both the IETF and ICANN have internal processes for
          making such assignments.</t>

          <t>The point here is not to say what the implications of this
          statement in the MoU are, but rather to call the reader's attention
          to the existence of this statement.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Liaison Statement on Technical Use of Domain Names">
          <t>When the IETF received processing requests to add names to the
          "Special-Use Domain Names" registry, as documented in <xref
          target="RESERVED-TLDS"/> and <xref
          target="P2P-DOMAIN-NAMES"/>, the IETF
          chartered a review of the process defined in RFC 6761 for adding
          names to the registry (as explained earlier). The IETF sent a
          liaison statement <xref target="SDO-IAB-ICANN-LS"/> to ICANN to
          notify them of the review, affirm that the discussion would be
          "open and transparent to participation by interested parties", and
          explicitly invite members of the ICANN community to participate.</t>
        </section>

          <section title="IAB Statement on the Registration of Special Use Names in the ARPA Domain">
          <t>As part of the process of resolving the controversy mentioned in <xref target="addl-tlds"/>, the IAB issued a statement saying, in part:</t>
<t>
There is currently no process defined with ICANN for special use names to be delegated in the root zone; it has seemed likely to take significant effort to create one. The IAB has noted that .arpa can be used "for technical infrastructure established by IETF standards" <xref target="SDO-IAB-SUDN-REG"/>.
</t>
<t>
Given the lack of an established process with ICANN, IETF documents cannot reserve names in the root of the DNS namespace if those names are to be delegated (that is, used by the DNS protocol).  It would be possible to work with ICANN to develop a process for such delegations, but the success of that joint work, and the amount of time it would take, would still be uncertain.

      <section anchor="su_sec_docs"
               title="Secondary Documents Relating to the Special-Use Domain Name Question">
        <t>In addition to these documents, there are several others with which
        participants in this discussion should be familiar.</t>

        <section title="Multicast DNS">

          <t>Multicast DNS <xref target="RFC6762"/> defines the Multicast DNS protocol, which uses the '.local' Special-Use Top-Level Domain Name.  Section 3 describes the semantics of "multicast DNS names". It is of considerable historical importance to note that the -00 version of the document that eventually became RFC 6762, an individual submission, was published in July of 2001. The version posted at that time contains substantially the same text in Section 3 as RFC 6762 did when published and was discussed in the DNSEXT Working Group at IETF 51 in August of 2001 <xref target="IETF-PRO-51"/>.  The July 2001 draft designated '.local.arpa' as the Special-Use Domain Name.  This idea was strongly opposed by DNSEXT Working Group participants, and as a result, the author eventually switched to using '.local'.</t>

          <t>The history of RFC 6762 is documented in substantial detail in
         Appendix H of RFC 6762; some notable milestones include the initial
          proposal to replace AppleTalk's Name Binding Protocol (NBP) in July 1997, the chartering of
          the Zeroconf Working Group in September 1999, and the assignment of a
          multicast address for link-local name discovery in April of 2000. A
          companion requirements document, eventually published as <xref
          target="RFC6760"/>, was first published in September of 2001.</t>

          <t>The point of mentioning these dates is so that discussions
          involving the time when the '.local' domain was first deployed, and
          the context in which it was deployed, may be properly informed.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="The '.onion' Special-Use Top-Level Domain Name">
          <t><xref target="RFC7686">The '.onion' Special-Use Top-Level Domain
          Name</xref> is important because it is the most recent IETF action
          on the topic of Special-Use Domain Names; although it does not set
          a new policy, the mere fact of its publication is worth thinking
          about.</t>

          <t>Two important points to consider about this document are that:
          <list style="symbols">
              <t>The IETF gained consensus to publish it.</t>

              <t>Devising a resolution to the situation was constrained by at
              least two factors. First, there was no process for allocating
              Special-Use Domain Names at the time that the '.onion' project
              started using the name;  at the time, and since the scope of use
              of the name was expected to be very constrained, the developers
              chose to allocate it unilaterally rather than asking the IETF or
              some other Standards Development Organization (SDO) to create a new process.

              <vspace blankLines="1"/>
              Second, for some time, the <xref target="SDO-CABF">CA/Browser
              Forum</xref> had been issuing certificates for what they
              referred to as "internal names". Internal names are names
              allocated unilaterally for use in site-specific contexts.
              Issuing certificates for such names came to be considered
              problematic, since no formal process for testing the validity of
              such names existed. Consequently, the CA/Browser Forum decided to
              phase out the use of such names in certificates <xref
              target="SDO-CABF-INT"/> and set a deadline after which no new
              certificates for such names would be issued <xref
              target="SDO-CABF-DEADLINE"/>. Because the '.onion' domain was
              allocated unilaterally, this would mean that certificates for
              subdomains of '.onion' could no longer be issued.<vspace
              blankLines="1"/> The IETF's designation of '.onion' as a
              Special-Use Top-Level Domain Name was needed to facilitate the
              development of a certificate issuance process specific to '.onion'
              domain names <xref target="SDO-CABF-BALLOT144"/>.</t>

        </section>

        <section title="Locally Served DNS Zones">
          <t><xref target="RFC6303">"Locally Served DNS Zones"</xref> describes
          a particular use case for zones that exist by definition and that
          are resolved using the DNS protocol, but that cannot have a global
          meaning because the host IP addresses they reference are not
          unique. This applies to a variety of addresses, including <xref
          target="RFC1918"> private IPv4 addresses</xref>, <xref
          target="RFC4193">"Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses"</xref> (in
          which this practice was first described), and <xref
          target="RFC6598">"IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address
          Space"</xref>.</t>

          <t>This use case is distinct from the use case for Special-Use
          Domain Names like '.local' and '.onion' in that the names are
          resolved using the DNS protocol (but they do require extensions or
          exceptions to the usual DNS resolution to enforce resolution in a
          local context rather than the global DNS context). 
          It shares the problem that such names can be assumed neither to be unique across all contexts nor functional for all Internet-connected hosts.</t>

        <section title="Name Collision in the DNS">

          <t><xref target="SDO-ICANN-COLL">"Name Collision in the DNS"</xref> is
          a study that was commissioned by ICANN in an attempt to characterize the
          potential risk to the Internet of adding global DNS delegations for
          names that were not previously delegated in the DNS and were not reserved
          under any RFC, but were also known to be (in the case of '.home') or surmised to be
          (in the case of '.corp') in significant use for Special-Use-type reasons (local scope
          DNS or other resolution protocols altogether).</t>

          reports on some issues surrounding the conflicting uses, interested
          parties, and processes related to the Domain Namespace. The specification
          recommends the development of collaborative processes among the
          various interested parties to coordinate their activities related to
          the Domain Namespace.</t>

        <section title="Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis">
          <t><xref target="RFC7050">"Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6
          Address Synthesis"</xref> is an example of a document that
          successfully used the process in RFC 6761 to designate '.ipv4only.arpa'
          as a Special-Use Domain Name; in this case, the process worked
          smoothly and without controversy.</t>

          <t>Unfortunately, while the IETF process worked smoothly, in the
          sense that there was little controversy or delay in approving the
          new use, it did not work correctly: the name 'ipv4only.arpa' was
          never added to the "Special-Use Domain Names" registry. This appears
          to have happened because the document did not explicitly request the
          addition of an entry for 'ipv4only.arpa' in the "Special-Use Domain
          Names" registry. This is an illustration of one of the problems that
          we have with the process in RFC 6761: it is apparently fairly easy to miss
          the step of adding the name to the registry.</t>

        <section anchor="addl-tlds"

          <t><xref target="RESERVED-TLDS"> "Additional
          Reserved Top Level Domains"</xref> is an example of a document that
          attempted to reserve several TLDs identified by ICANN as
          particularly at risk for collision as Special-Use Domain Names with
          no documented use. This attempt failed.</t>

          <t>Although the aforementioned document failed to gain consensus to be published, the
          need it was intended to fill still exists. Unfortunately, although a
          fair amount is known about the use of these names, no RFC exists that describes
          how they are used and why it would be a problem to delegate them.
          Additionally, to the extent that the uses being made of these names
          are valid, no document exists indicating when it might make sense to
          use them and when it would not make sense to use them.</t>

          <t>RFC 7788 <xref target="RFC7788"/> defines the Top-Level Domain Name
          '.home' for use as the default name for name resolution relative to
          a home network context. Although, as defined in RFC 7788, '.home' is
          a Special-Use Domain Name, RFC 7788 did not follow the process
          specified in RFC 6761: it did not request that '.home' be added to
          the "Special-Use Domain Names" registry. This was recognized as a
          mistake and resulted in the posting of an errata report <xref
          target="Err4677"/>. Additionally, '.home' is an example of an
          attempt to reuse a domain name that has already been put into use
          for other purposes without following established processes <xref
          target="SDO-ICANN-COLL"/>, which further complicates the situation.
          At the time [RFCXXXX] was written, the IETF was developing a
          solution to this problem.</t>
        </section>

    <section title="History">

      <t>A newcomer to the problem of resolving domain names may be under the
      impression that the DNS sprang fully formed directly from Paul Mockapetris' head (as was the birth of Athena in Greek Mythology). This is not the case.
      At the time the IAB technical document was written <xref
      target="RFC2826"/>, memories would have been fresh of the evolutionary
      process that led to DNS' dominance as a protocol for domain name
      resolution.</t>

      <t>In fact, in the early days of the Internet, hostnames were resolved
      using a text file, HOSTS.TXT, which was maintained by a central
      authority, the Network Information Center, and distributed to all hosts
      on the Internet using the <xref target="RFC0959">File Transfer Protocol
      (FTP)</xref>.

      The inefficiency of this process is cited as a reason for
      the development of the DNS <xref target="RFC0882"/> <xref target="RFC0883"/> in 1983.</t>

      <t>However, the transition from HOSTS.TXT to the DNS was not smooth. For
      example, <xref target="CORP-SUN-NIS">Sun Microsystems' Network
      Information System (NIS)</xref>, at the time known as Yellow Pages, was an
      active competitor to the DNS, although it failed to provide a complete
      solution to the global naming problem.</t>

      <t>Another example was NetBIOS Name Service, also known as WINS <xref
      target="RFC1002"/>. This protocol was used mostly by Microsoft Windows
      machines, but also by open-source BSD and Linux operating systems to do
      name resolution using Microsoft's own name resolution protocol.</t>

      <t>Most modern operating systems can still use the '/etc/hosts' file for
      name resolution. Many still have a name service switch that can be
      configured on the host to resolve some domains using the NIS or WINS. Most
      have the capability to resolve names using mDNS by recognizing the
      special meaning of the '.local' Special-Use Top-Level Domain Name.</t>

      <t>The Sun Microsystems model of having private domains within a
      corporate site, while supporting the global Domain Name System for
      off-site, persisted even after the NIS protocol fell into disuse.
      Microsoft used to recommend that site administrators use a "private" TLD
      for internal use, and this practice was very much a part of the
      zeitgeist at the time (see Section 5.1 of <xref
      target="SDO-ICANN-COLL"/> and Appendix G of <xref target="RFC6762"/>).
      This attitude is at the root of the widespread practice of simply
      picking an apparently unused TLD and using it for experimental purposes,
      which persists even at the time of writing of this memo.</t>

      <t>This history is being presented because discussions about Special-Use
      Domain Names in the IETF often come down to the question of why users of
      new name resolution protocols choose to use domain names rather than
      using some other naming concept that doesn't overlap with the namespace
      that, in modern times is, by default, resolved using the DNS.</t>

      <t>The answer is that as a consequence of this long history of resolving
      domain names using a wide variety of name resolution systems, domain
      names are required in a large variety of contexts in user interfaces and
      applications programming interfaces. Any name that appears in such a
      context is a domain name. So, developers of new name resolution systems
      that must work in existing contexts actually have no choice: they must
      use a Special-Use Domain Name to segregate a portion of the namespace
      for use with their system.</t>
