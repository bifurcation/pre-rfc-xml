        <section title="Introduction" anchor="section-1"><t>
   The Designated Forwarder (DF) in Ethernet VPNs (EVPNs) is the
   Provider Edge (PE) router responsible for sending Broadcast, Unknown
   Unicast, and Multicast (BUM) traffic to a multihomed Customer Edge (CE)
   device on a given VLAN on a particular Ethernet Segment (ES).
   The DF is elected from the set of multihomed PEs attached to a given ES,
   each of which advertises an ES route for the ES as identified by its
   Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI). By default, the
   EVPN uses a DF election algorithm referred to as "service carving".
   The DF election algorithm is based on a modulus function (V mod N) that
   takes the number of PEs in the ES (N) and the VLAN value (V) as input.
   This document addresses inefficiencies in the default DF election algorithm
   by defining a new DF election algorithm and an ability to influence the
   DF election result for a VLAN, depending on the state of the associated
   Attachment Circuit (AC). In order to avoid any ambiguity with the
   identifier used in the DF election algorithm, this document uses the
   term "Ethernet Tag" instead of "VLAN". This document also creates a
   registry with IANA for future DF election algorithms and capabilities
   (see <xref target="section-7"/>). It also presents a formal definition and
   clarification of the DF election Finite State Machine (FSM). Therefore,
   this document updates <xref target="RFC7432"/>, and EVPN implementations
   MUST conform to the prescribed&nbsp;FSM.</t>

        <t>
   The procedures described in this document apply to DF election in all
   EVPN solutions, including those described in <xref target="RFC7432"/> and
   <xref target="RFC8214"/>. Apart from the formal description of the FSM,
   this document does not intend to update other procedures described in
   <xref target="RFC7432"/>; it only aims to improve the behavior of the
   DF election on PEs that are upgraded to follow the procedures described in
   this document.</t>

     <t>Ethernet Tag: Used to represent a BD that is

     any of the following may be used to represent a BD:
     VIDs (including Q-in-Q tags), configured IDs, VNIs
     (Virtual Extensible Local Area Network (VXLAN) Network
     Identifiers), normalized VIDs, I-SIDs (Service Instance

     can peer with a central point, the RR -- acting as a route reflector

        <t>
   <xref target="ref-evpn-multihoming"/> illustrates a case where
   there are two ESes: ES1 and ES2.  PE1 is attached to CE1 via ES1, whereas
   PE2, PE3, and PE4 are attached to CE2 via ES2, i.e., PE2, PE3, and PE4
   form a redundancy group. Since CE2 is multihomed to different PEs on
   the same ES, it is necessary for PE2, PE3, and PE4 to agree on a DF to
   satisfy the above-mentioned requirements.</t>

        <t>
   The effect of forwarding loops in a Layer 2 network is particularly
   severe because of the broadcast nature of Ethernet traffic and the
   lack of a TTL. Therefore, it is very important that, in the case of a
   multihomed CE, only one of the PEs be used to send BUM traffic to it.</t>

        <t>
   One of the prerequisites for this support is that participating PEs
   must agree amongst themselves as to who would act as the DF.
   This needs to be achieved through a distributed
   algorithm in which each participating PE independently and
   unambiguously selects one of the participating PEs as the DF, and the
   result should be consistent and unanimous.</t>

        <t>
   The default algorithm for DF election defined by <xref target="RFC7432"/>
   at the granularity of (ESI,&nbsp;EVI) is referred to as "service carving". In this
   document, service carving and the default DF election algorithm are used
   interchangeably. With service carving, it is possible to elect
   multiple DFs per ES (one per EVI) in order to perform
   load balancing of traffic destined to a given ES. The objective
   is that the load-balancing procedures should carve up the BD space
   among the redundant PE nodes evenly, in such a way that every PE is
   the DF for a distinct set of EVIs.</t>

        <t>
   The DF election algorithm (as described in <xref target="RFC7432"/>,
   Section&nbsp;8.5) is based on a modulus operation. The PEs to which the ES
   (for which DF election is to be carried out per EVI) is multihomed form an
   ordered (ordinal) list in ascending order by PE IP address value. For
   example, there are N PEs: PE0, PE1,... PE(N-1) ranked as per increasing
   IP addresses in the ordinal list; then, for each VLAN with Ethernet
   Tag V, configured on ES1, PEx is the DF for VLAN V on ES1 when x equals
   (V mod N). In the case of a VLAN Bundle, only the lowest VLAN is used. In
   the case when the planned density is high (meaning there are a significant
   number of VLANs and the Ethernet Tags are uniformly distributed), the
   thinking is that the DF election will be spread across the PEs hosting that
   ES and good load balancing can be achieved.</t>

        <t>
   However, the described default DF election algorithm has some
   undesirable properties and, in some cases, can be somewhat disruptive
   and unfair. This document describes some of those issues and defines
   a mechanism for dealing with them. These mechanisms do involve
   changes to the default DF election algorithm, but they do not require
   any changes to the EVPN route exchange, and changes in the EVPN routes
   will be minimal.</t>

        <t>
   In addition, there is a need to extend the DF election procedures so
   that new algorithms and capabilities are possible. A single algorithm
   (the default DF election algorithm) may not meet the requirements in
   all the use cases.</t>

        <t>
   Note that while <xref target="RFC7432"/> elects a DF per &lt;ES, EVI&gt;, this document
   elects a DF per &lt;ES, BD&gt;. This means that unlike <xref target="RFC7432"/>, where for
   a VLAN-aware Bundle service EVI there is only one DF for the EVI,
   this document specifies that there will be multiple DFs, one for each
   BD configured in that EVI.</t>

        </section>

        <section title="Problem Statement" anchor="section-1.3"><t>
   This section describes some potential issues with the default DF election
   algorithm.</t>

        <section title="Unfair Load Balancing and Service Disruption" anchor="section-1.3.1"><t>
   There are three fundamental problems with the current default DF election
   algorithm.</t>

        <t><list style="numbers"><t>The algorithm will not perform well when the Ethernet Tag
      follows a non-uniform distribution -- for instance, when the Ethernet
      Tags are all even or all odd. In such a case, let us assume that
      the ES is multihomed to two PEs; one of the PEs will be elected
      as the DF for all of the VLANs. This is very suboptimal. It defeats
      the purpose of service carving, as the DFs are not really evenly
      spread across the PEs hosting the ES. In fact, in this particular case,
      one of the PEs does not get elected as the DF at all, so it does not
      participate in DF responsibilities at all. Consider another example
      where, referring to <xref target="ref-evpn-multihoming"/>,
      let's assume that (1)&nbsp;PE2, PE3, and PE4 are listed in ascending
      order by IP address and (2)&nbsp;each VLAN configured on ES2 is
      associated with an Ethernet Tag of the form (3x+1), where x is an
      integer. This will result in PE3 always being selected as the DF.</t>

        <t>The Ethernet Tag that identifies the BD can be as large as 2^24;
      however, it is not guaranteed that the tenant BD on the ES will
      conform to a uniform distribution. In fact, it is up to the
      customer what BDs they will configure on the ES.
<!-- DNE text below (so can't add a series comma after "256"). -->
      Quoting <xref target="Knuth"/>:<list style="empty"><t>In general, we want to avoid values of
      M that divide r^k+a or r^k-a, where k and a are small numbers and r is
      the radix of the alphabetic character set (usually r=64, 256 or 100),
      since a remainder modulo such a value of M tends to be largely a simple
      superposition of key digits. Such considerations suggest that we choose
      M to be a prime number such that r^k!=a(modulo)M or r^k!=?a(modulo)M for
      small k &amp; a.</t></list><vspace blankLines="1"/>

      In our case, N is the number of PEs (Section&nbsp;8.5 of
      <xref target="RFC7432"/>). N corresponds to M above.
      Since N, N-1, or N+1 need not satisfy the primality properties of M,
      as per the modulo-based DF assignment <xref target="RFC7432"/>,
      whenever a PE goes down or a new PE boots up (attached to the same ES),
      the modulo scheme will not necessarily map BDs to PEs uniformly.</t>

        <t>Disruption is another problem. Consider a case when the
      same ES is multihomed to a set of PEs. When the ES
      is DOWN in one of the PEs, say PE1, or PE1 itself reboots, or the
      BGP process goes down or the connectivity between PE1 and an RR
      goes down, the effective number of PEs in the system now becomes
      N-1, and DFs are computed for all the VLANs that are configured on
      that ES. In general, if the DF for a VLAN V happens
      not to be PE1, but some other PE, say PE2, it is likely that some
      other PE (different from PE1 and PE2) will become the new DF. This
      is not desirable. Similarly, when a new PE hosts the same
      ES, the mapping again changes because of the modulus
      operation. This results in needless churn. Again referring to
      <xref target="ref-evpn-multihoming"/>,
      say V1, V2, and V3 are VLANs configured on ES2 with
      associated Ethernet Tags of values 999, 1000, and 1001, respectively.
      So, PE1, PE2, and PE3 are the DFs for V1, V2, and V3, respectively.
      Now when PE3 goes down, PE2 will become the DF for V1 and PE1 will
      become the DF for V2.</t>

        </list>
        </t>

        <t>
   One point to note is that the default DF election algorithm assumes
   that all the PEs who are multihomed to the same ES
   (and interested in the DF election by exchanging EVPN routes) use an
   Originating Router's IP address <xref target="RFC7432"/> of the
   same family. This does not need to be the case, as the EVPN
   address family can be carried over an IPv4 or IPv6 peering, and the
   PEs attached to the same ES may use an address of either family.</t>

        <t>
   Mathematically, a conventional hash function maps a key k to a number
   i representing one of m hash buckets through a function h(k), i.e.,
   i&nbsp;=&nbsp;h(k). In the EVPN case, h is simply a modulo-m hash function
   viz. h(V) = V mod N, where N is the number of PEs that are multihomed to
   the ES in question. It is well known that for good hash distribution
   using the modulus operation, the modulus N should be a prime number
   not too close to a power of 2 <xref target="CLRS2009"/>. When the
   effective number of PEs changes from N to N-1 (or vice versa), all
   the objects (VLAN&nbsp;V) will be remapped except those for which V mod N
   and V&nbsp;mod&nbsp;(N-1) refer to the same PE in the previous and
   subsequent ordinal rankings, respectively. From a forwarding perspective,
   this is a churn, as it results in reprogramming the PE ports as either
   blocking or non-blocking at the PEs where the DF state changes.</t>

        <t>
   This document addresses this problem and furnishes a solution to this
   undesirable behavior.</t>

        </section>

        <section title="Traffic Black-Holing on Individual AC Failures"
           anchor="section-1.3.2">
        <t>
   The default DF election algorithm defined by <xref target="RFC7432"/> takes
   into account only two variables in the modulus function for a given ES: the
   existence of the PE's IP address in the candidate list and the locally
   provisioned Ethernet Tags.</t>

        <t>
   If the DF for an &lt;ESI, EVI&gt; fails (due to physical link/node
   failures), an ES route withdrawal will make the NDF PEs
   re&nbhy;elect the DF for that &lt;ESI, EVI&gt; and the service will be
   recovered.</t>

        <t>
   However, the default DF election procedure does not provide
   protection against "logical" failures or human errors that may occur
   at the service level on the DF, while the list of active PEs for a given
   ES does not change. These failures may have an impact not only on the
   local PE where the issue happens but also on the rest of the PEs of
   the ES. Some examples of such logical failures are listed below:</t>

   BD-1 is defined in PE1, PE2, PE3, and PE4. CE12 is a multihomed CE
   connected to ES12 in PE1 and PE2. Similarly, CE23 is multihomed to
   PE2 and PE3 using ES23. Both CE12 and CE23 are connected to BD-1
   through VLAN-based service interfaces: CE12-VID 1 (VID 1 on CE12)
   is associated with AC1 and AC2 in BD-1, whereas CE23-VID 1 is
   associated with AC3 and AC4 in BD-1. Assume that, although not
   represented, there are other ACs defined on these ESes mapped to
   different BDs.</t>

        <t>
   After executing the default DF election algorithm as described in
   <xref target="RFC7432"/>, PE2 turns out to be the DF for ES12 and
   ES23 in BD-1. The following issues may arise:</t>

     <t><list style="format (%c)"><t>If AC2 is accidentally shut down or
      is not configured yet, CE12 traffic will be impacted. In the case of
      All-Active multihoming, the BUM traffic to CE12 will be "black-holed",
      whereas for Single-Active multihoming, all the traffic to/from CE12 will
      be discarded. This is because a logical failure in PE2's AC2
      may not trigger an ES route withdrawal for ES12 (since there
      are still other ACs active on ES12); therefore, PE1 will not rerun
      the DF election procedures.
     </t>

     <t>If the bridge table for BD-1 is administratively shut down or is
      not configured yet on PE2, CE12 and CE23 will both be impacted:
      BUM traffic to both CEs will be discarded in the case of All&nbhy;Active
      multihoming, and all traffic will be discarded to&wj;/from the CEs in the
      case of Single-Active multihoming. This is because PE1 and PE3 will not
      rerun the DF election procedures and will keep assuming that PE2 is
      the DF.</t>

   Quoting <xref target="RFC7432"/>, "When an Ethernet tag is decommissioned
   on an Ethernet segment, then the PE MUST withdraw the Ethernet A-D per EVI
   route(s) announced for the &lt;ESI, Ethernet tags&gt; that are impacted by
   the decommissioning." However, while this A-D per EVI route withdrawal
   is used at the remote PEs performing aliasing or backup procedures,
   it is not used to influence the DF election for the affected EVIs.</t>

        <t>
   This document adds an optional modification of the DF election
   procedure so that the ACS may be taken into account as a variable in
   the DF election; therefore, EVPN can provide protection against
   logical failures.</t>

  <section title="The Need for Extending the Default DF Election in EVPN Services" anchor="section-1.4"><t>

   <xref target="section-1.3"/> describes some of the issues that exist in the
   default DF election procedures. In order to address those issues, this
   document introduces a new DF election framework. This framework allows the
   PEs to agree on a common DF election algorithm, as well as the
   capabilities to enable during the DF election procedure. Generally,
   "DF election algorithm" refers to the algorithm by which a number of
   input parameters are used to determine the DF PE, while "DF election
   capability" refers to an additional feature that can be used prior to
   the invocation of the DF election algorithm, such as modifying the
   inputs (or list of candidate PEs).</t>

        <t>
   Within this framework, this document defines a new DF election
   algorithm and a new capability that can influence the DF election
   result:</t>

     <t><list style="symbols"><t>The new DF election algorithm is referred
     to as "Highest Random Weight" (HRW). The HRW procedures are described
     in <xref target="section-3"/>.</t>

     <t>The new DF election capability is referred to as "AC-Influenced
     DF election" (AC-DF). The AC-DF procedures are described in
     <xref target="section-4"/>.</t>

     <t>HRW and AC-DF mechanisms are independent of each other. Therefore,
     a PE may support either HRW or AC-DF independently or may support
     both of them together. A PE may also support the AC&nbhy;DF capability
     along with the default DF election algorithm per
     <xref target="RFC7432"/>.</t>
    </list></t>

        <t>
   In addition, this document defines a way to indicate the support of
   HRW and/or AC-DF along with the EVPN ES routes advertised for a given
   ES. Refer to <xref target="section-2.2"/> for more details.</t>

        <section title="Designated Forwarder Election Protocol and BGP Extensions" anchor="section-2"><t>
   This section describes the BGP extensions required to support the new
   DF election procedures. In addition, since the EVPN specification
   <xref target="RFC7432"/> leaves several questions open as to the
   precise FSM behavior of the DF election, <xref target="section-2.1"/>
   precisely describes the intended behavior.</t>

        <section title="The DF Election Finite State Machine (FSM)"
 anchor="section-2.1">

<t>Per <xref target="RFC7432"/>, the FSM shown in 
   <xref target="ref-df-election-finite-state-machine"/> is executed per
   &lt;ES,&nbsp;VLAN&gt; in the case of VLAN-based service or
   &lt;ES,&nbsp;[VLANs&nbsp;in&nbsp;VLAN&nbsp;Bundle]&gt; in the case of a
   VLAN Bundle on each participating PE. Note that the FSM is conceptual. Any
   design or implementation MUST comply with behavior that is equivalent to

        <section title="The DF Election Extended Community"
 anchor="section-2.2">

<t>For the DF election procedures to be consistent and unanimous, it is
   necessary that all the participating PEs agree on the DF election
   algorithm and capabilities to be used. For instance, it is not
   possible for some PEs to continue to use the default DF election
   algorithm while some PEs use HRW. For brownfield deployments and for
   interoperability with legacy PEs, it is important that all PEs have the
   ability to fall back on the default DF election. A PE can indicate its
   willingness to support HRW and/or AC-DF by signaling a
   DF Election Extended Community along with the ES route
   (Route Type&nbsp;4).</t>

   The DF Election Extended Community is used as follows:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols"><t>A PE SHOULD attach the DF Election
     Extended Community to any advertised ES route, and the
     Extended Community MUST be sent if the ES is locally configured with a
     DF election algorithm other than the default DF election algorithm or if a
     capability is required to be used. In the Extended Community, the PE
     indicates the desired "DF Alg" algorithm and "Bitmap" capabilities to be
     used for the&nbsp;ES.
     <list style="symbols">
       <t>Only one DF Election Extended Community can be sent along with an
       ES route. Note that the intent is not for the advertising PE to
       indicate all the supported DF election algorithms and
       capabilities but to signal the preferred one.</t>

        <t>DF Alg values 0 and 1 can both be used with Bit 1 (AC-DF)
        set to 0 or 1.</t>

        <t>In general, a specific DF Alg SHOULD determine the use of the
       reserved bits in the Extended Community, which may be used in a
       different way for a different DF Alg. &nbsp;In particular, for DF Alg
       values 0 and 1, the reserved bits are not set by the advertising PE and
       SHOULD be ignored by the receiving PE.</t>

        </list>
        </t>

        <t>When a PE receives the ES routes from all the other PEs for the ES
     in question, it checks to see if all the advertisements have the
     Extended Community with the same DF Alg and Bitmap:
     <list style="symbols">
       <t>If they do, this particular PE MUST follow the
       procedures for the advertised DF Alg and capabilities. For
       instance, if all ES routes for a given ES indicate DF Alg HRW and
       AC-DF set to&nbsp;1, then the PEs attached to the ES will perform
       the DF election as per the HRW algorithm and following the
       AC-DF procedures.</t>

        <t>Otherwise, if even a single advertisement for Route Type 4 is
       received without the locally configured DF Alg and capability,
       the default DF election algorithm MUST be used as prescribed in
       <xref target="RFC7432"/>. This procedure handles the case where
       participating PEs in the ES disagree about the DF algorithm and
       capability to be applied.</t>

        <t>The absence of the DF Election Extended Community or the presence
       of multiple DF Election Extended Communities (in the same route)
       MUST be interpreted by a receiving PE as an indication of the
       default DF election algorithm on the sending PE -- that is,
       DF&nbsp;Alg&nbsp;0 and no DF election capabilities.</t>

        </list>
        </t>

        <t>When all the PEs in an ES advertise DF Type 31, they will rely on
     the local policy to decide how to proceed with the DF election.</t>

   The procedure discussed in this section is applicable to the DF election
   in EVPN services <xref target="RFC7432"/> and the EVPN Virtual Private
   Wire Service (VPWS) <xref target="RFC8214"/>.</t>

        <t>
   HRW as defined in <xref target="HRW1999"/> is originally
   proposed in the context of Internet caching and proxy server load
   balancing. Given an object name and a set of servers, HRW maps a
   request to a server using the object-name (object-id) and server-name
   (server-id) rather than the server states. HRW forms a hash out of
   the server&nbhy;id and the object&nbhy;id and forms an ordered list of the
   servers for the particular object&nbhy;id. The server for which the hash
   value is highest serves as the primary server responsible for that
   particular object, and the server with the next&nbhy;highest value in that
   hash serves as the backup server. HRW always maps a given object name
   to the same server within a given cluster; consequently, it can be
   used at client sites to achieve global consensus on object-to-server
   mappings. When that server goes down, the backup server becomes the
   responsible designate.</t>

        <t>
   Choosing an appropriate hash function that is statistically oblivious
   to the key distribution and imparts a good uniform distribution of
   the hash output is an important aspect of the algorithm. Fortunately,
   many such hash functions exist. <xref target="HRW1999"/> provides
   pseudorandom functions based on the Unix utilities rand and srand and easily
   constructed XOR functions that satisfy the desired hashing
   properties. HRW already finds use in multicast and ECMP
   <xref target="RFC2991"/> <xref target="RFC2992"/>.</t>

        <section title="HRW and Consistent Hashing" anchor="section-3.1"><t>
   HRW is not the only algorithm that addresses the object-to-server
   mapping problem with goals of fair load distribution, redundancy, and
   fast access. There is another family of algorithms that also
   addresses this problem; these fall under the umbrella of the
   Consistent Hashing Algorithms <xref target="CHASH"/>. These will not be
   considered here.</t>

        </section>

        <section title="HRW Algorithm for EVPN DF Election" anchor="section-3.2"><t>
   This section describes the application of HRW to DF election. Let
   DF(V) denote the DF and BDF(V) denote the BDF for the Ethernet Tag V;
   Si is the IP address of PE i; Es is the ESI; and Weight is a function of
   V, Si, and Es.</t>

        <t>
   Note that while the DF election algorithm provided in
   <xref target="RFC7432"/> uses a PE address and VLAN as inputs,
   this document uses an Ethernet Tag, PE address, and ESI as inputs.
   This is because if the same set of PEs are multihomed to the same set of
   ESes, then the DF election algorithm used in <xref target="RFC7432"/>
   would result in the same PE being elected DF for the same set of BDs on
   each ES; this could have adverse side&nbsp;effects on both load balancing
   and redundancy. Including an ESI in the DF election algorithm introduces
   additional entropy, which significantly reduces the probability of the
   same PE being elected DF for the same set of BDs on each ES. Therefore, when
   using the HRW algorithm for EVPN DF election, the ESI value in the
   Weight function below SHOULD be set to that of the corresponding ES.</t>

        <t>
   In the case of a VLAN Bundle service, V denotes the lowest VLAN, similar
   to the "lowest VLAN in bundle" logic of <xref target="RFC7432"/>.</t>

        <t><list style="numbers"><t>DF(V) = Si| Weight(V, Es, Si) &gt;=
        Weight(V, Es, Sj), for all j. In the case of a tie, choose the PE
        whose IP address is numerically the least.
        Note that 0 &lt;= i,j &lt; number of PEs in the redundancy group.</t>

        <t>BDF(V) = Sk| Weight(V, Es, Si) &gt;= Weight(V, Es, Sk), and
       Weight(V,&nbsp;Es,&nbsp;Sk) &gt;= Weight(V, Es, Sj). In the case of
       a tie, choose the PE whose IP address is numerically the least.</t>

        </list>
        </t>

        <t>
   Where:</t>

  <t><list style="symbols">
   <t>DF(V) is defined to be the address Si (index i) for which
   Weight(V,&nbsp;Es,&nbsp;Si) is the highest; 0 &lt;= i &lt; N-1.</t>

   <t>BDF(V) is defined as that PE with address Sk for which the computed
   Weight is the next highest after the Weight of the DF. j&nbsp;is the
   running index from 0 to N-1; i and k are selected values.</t>

 </list></t>

        <t>
   Since the Weight is a pseudorandom function with the domain as the
   three-tuple (V, Es, S), it is an efficient and deterministic
   algorithm that is independent of the Ethernet Tag V sample space
   distribution. Choosing a good hash function for the pseudorandom
   function is an important consideration for this algorithm to perform
   better than the default algorithm. As mentioned previously, such
   functions are described in <xref target="HRW1999"/>. We take as a
   candidate hash function the first one out of the two that are
   listed as preferred in <xref target="HRW1999"/>:</t>

        <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   Wrand(V, Es, Si) = (1103515245((1103515245.Si+12345) XOR
   D(V, Es))+12345)(mod 2^31)
   ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
   Here, D(V, Es) is the 31-bit digest (CRC-32 and discarding the
   most&nbsp;significant bit (MSB), as noted in <xref target="HRW1999"/>) of
   the 14-octet stream (the 4-octet Ethernet Tag V followed by the 10-octet ESI).
   It is mandated that the 14-octet stream be formed by
   the concatenation of the Ethernet Tag and the ESI in network byte order.
   The CRC should proceed as if the stream is in network byte order
   (big&nbhy;endian). Si&nbsp;is the address of the ith server. The server's
   IP&nbsp;address length does not matter, as only the low-order
   31&nbsp;bits are modulo significant.</t>

        <t>
   A point to note is that the Weight function takes into consideration
   the combination of the Ethernet Tag, the ES, and the PE
   IP&nbsp;address, and the actual length of the server IP address (whether
   IPv4 or IPv6) is not really relevant. The default algorithm defined in
   <xref target="RFC7432"/> cannot employ both IPv4 and IPv6 PE addresses,
   since <xref target="RFC7432"/> does not specify how to decide on the
   ordering (the ordinal list) when both IPv4 and IPv6 PEs are present.</t>

        <t>
   HRW solves the disadvantages pointed out in
   <xref target="section-1.3.1"/> of this document and ensures that:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols"><t>With very high probability, the task of
     DF election for the VLANs configured on an ES is more or less equally
     distributed among the PEs, even in the case of two PEs (see the first

     <t>If a PE that is not the DF or the BDF for that VLAN goes down or

     <t>More importantly, it avoids the third fundamental problem listed
     in <xref target="section-1.3.1"/> (needless disruption) that is

 <section title="The AC-Influenced DF Election Capability" anchor="section-4">

   <t>The procedure discussed in this section is applicable to the DF election
   in EVPN services <xref target="RFC7432"/> and EVPN VPWS
   <xref target="RFC8214"/>.</t>

        <t>
   The AC-DF capability is expected to be generally applicable to
   any future DF algorithm. It modifies the DF election procedures by
   removing from consideration any candidate PE in the ES that cannot
   forward traffic on the AC that belongs to the BD. This section is
   applicable to VLAN-based and VLAN Bundle service interfaces. <xref
   target="section-4.1"/> describes the procedures for VLAN-aware Bundle
   service interfaces.</t>

        <t>
   In particular, when used with the default DF algorithm, the AC-DF
   capability modifies Step 3 in the DF election procedure described
   in <xref target="RFC7432"/>, Section&nbsp;8.5, as follows:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="3.">When the timer expires, each PE builds an ordered
      candidate list of the IP addresses of all the PE nodes attached to the
      ES (including itself), in increasing numeric value. The candidate list
      is based on the Originating Router's IP addresses of the ES routes but
      excludes any PE from whom no Ethernet A-D per ES route has been received
      or from whom the route has been withdrawn. Afterwards, the DF election
      algorithm is applied on a per &lt;ES,&nbsp;Ethernet Tag&gt;; however,
      the IP address for a PE will not be considered to be a candidate for a
      given &lt;ES, Ethernet Tag&gt; until the corresponding Ethernet A-D per
      EVI route has been received from that PE. In other words, the ACS on the
      ES for a given PE must be UP so that the PE is considered to be a candidate
      for a given BD.
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      If the default DF algorithm is used, every PE in the resulting candidate
      list is then given an ordinal indicating its position in the
      ordered list, starting with 0 as the ordinal for the PE with the
      numerically lowest IP address. The ordinals are used to determine
      which PE node will be the DF for a given Ethernet Tag on the
      ES, using the following rule:
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        Assuming a redundancy group of N PE nodes, for VLAN-based service,
      the PE with ordinal i is the DF for an &lt;ES, Ethernet Tag V&gt; when
      (V mod N) = i. In the case of a VLAN (-aware) Bundle service, then the
      numerically lowest VLAN value in that bundle on that ES MUST be
      used in the modulo function as the Ethernet Tag.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      It should be noted that using the Originating Router's IP Address field
      <xref target="RFC7432"/> in the ES route to get the PE IP address
      needed for the ordered list allows for a CE to be multihomed across
      different Autonomous Systems (ASes) if such a need ever arises.
        </t>
      </list></t>

        <t>
   The modified Step 3, above, differs from <xref target="RFC7432"/>,
   Section&nbsp;8.5, Step&nbsp;3 in two ways:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols"><t>Any DF Alg can be used -- not only
     the described modulus-based DF Alg (referred to as the default DF
     election or "DF Alg 0" in this document).</t>

        <t>The candidate list is pruned based upon non-receipt of Ethernet A-D
     routes: a PE's IP address MUST be removed from the ES candidate
     list if its Ethernet A-D per ES route is withdrawn. A PE's IP
     address MUST NOT be considered to be a candidate DF for an
     &lt;ES, Ethernet Tag&gt; if its Ethernet A-D per EVI route for the
     &lt;ES,&nbsp;Ethernet Tag&gt; is withdrawn.</t>
    </list></t>

        <t>
   The following example illustrates the AC-DF behavior applied to the
   default DF election algorithm, assuming the network in
   <xref target="ref-default-df-election-and-traffic-black-holing"/>:</t>

   <t><list style="format (%c)">
    <t>When PE1 and PE2 discover ES12, they advertise an ES route for ES12
    with the associated ES&nbhy;Import Extended Community and the DF
    Election Extended Community indicating AC-DF = 1; they start a DF
    Wait timer (independently). Likewise, PE2 and PE3 advertise an ES
    route for ES23 with AC-DF = 1 and start a DF Wait timer.</t>

    <t> PE1 and PE2 advertise an Ethernet A-D per ES route for ES12.
    PE2 and PE3 advertise an Ethernet A-D per ES route for ES23.</t>

    <t>In addition, PE1, PE2, and PE3 advertise an Ethernet A-D per EVI
    route for AC1, AC2, AC3, and AC4 as soon as the ACs are enabled. Note
    that the AC can be associated with a single customer VID (e.g.,
    VLAN-based service interfaces) or a bundle of customer VIDs (e.g.,
    VLAN Bundle service interfaces).</t>

    <t>When the timer expires, each PE builds an ordered
    candidate list of the IP addresses of all the PE nodes
    attached to the ES (including itself) as explained in
    the modified Step&nbsp;3 above. Any PE from which an Ethernet A-D per ES
    route has not been received is pruned from the list.
        </t>

        <t>When electing the DF for a given BD, a PE will not be considered
      to be a candidate until an Ethernet A-D per EVI route has been received
      from that PE. In other words, the ACS on the ES for a given PE
      must be UP so that the PE is considered to be a candidate for a given
      BD. For example, PE1 will not consider PE2 as a candidate for
      DF election for &lt;ES12,&nbsp;VLAN-1&gt; until an Ethernet A-D per
      EVI route is received from PE2 for &lt;ES12,&nbsp;VLAN&nbhy;1&gt;.
        </t>

      <t>Once the PEs with ACS = DOWN for a given BD have been removed from
      the candidate list, the DF election can be applied for the
      remaining N candidates.
        </t>
     </list></t>

        <t>
   Note that this procedure only modifies the existing EVPN control
   plane by adding and processing the DF Election Extended Community
   and&nbsp;by pruning the candidate list of PEs that take part in the DF
   election.</t>

        <t>
   In addition to the events defined in the FSM in
   <xref target="section-2.1"/>, the following events SHALL modify the
   candidate PE list and trigger the DF re-election in a PE for a given
   &lt;ES, Ethernet Tag&gt;. In the FSM shown in
   <xref target="ref-df-election-finite-state-machine"/>, the events below
   MUST trigger a transition from DF_DONE to DF_CALC:</t>

   <t><list style="numbers">
     <t>Local AC going DOWN/UP.</t>

     <t>Reception of a new Ethernet A-D per ES route update/withdrawal for

   </list></t>

        <section title="AC-Influenced DF Election Capability for VLAN-Aware
 Bundle Services" anchor="section-4.1">

<t>The procedure described in <xref target="section-4"/> works for
   VLAN-based and VLAN Bundle service interfaces because, for those service
   types, a PE advertises only one Ethernet A-D per EVI route per
   &lt;ES,&nbsp;VLAN&gt; or &lt;ES,&nbsp;VLAN Bundle&gt;. In <xref target="section-4"/>,
   an Ethernet Tag represents a given VLAN or VLAN Bundle for the purpose of
   DF election. The withdrawal of such a route means that the PE cannot
   forward traffic on that particular &lt;ES,&nbsp;VLAN&gt; or
   &lt;ES,&nbsp;VLAN Bundle&gt;; therefore, the PE can be removed from
   consideration for DF election.</t>

        <t>
   According to <xref target="RFC7432"/>, in VLAN-aware Bundle services, the PE
   advertises multiple Ethernet A-D per EVI routes per &lt;ES,&nbsp;VLAN Bundle&gt;
   (one route per Ethernet Tag), while the DF election is still
   performed per &lt;ES,&nbsp;VLAN Bundle&gt;. The withdrawal of an individual route
   only indicates the unavailability of a specific AC and not necessarily
   all the ACs in the &lt;ES,&nbsp;VLAN Bundle&gt;.</t>

        <t>
   This document modifies the DF election for VLAN-aware Bundle services
   in the following ways:</t>

    <t><list style="symbols">
     <t>After confirming that all the PEs in the ES advertise the AC-DF
     capability, a PE will perform a DF election per &lt;ES,&nbsp;VLAN&gt;, as
     opposed to per &lt;ES,&nbsp;VLAN Bundle&gt; as described in
     <xref target="RFC7432"/>. Now, the withdrawal of an Ethernet A-D per
     EVI route for a VLAN will indicate that the advertising PE's ACS is
     DOWN and the rest of the PEs in the ES can remove the PE from
     consideration for DF election in the &lt;ES,&nbsp;VLAN&gt;.</t>

     <t>The PEs will now follow the procedures in <xref target="section-4"/>.</t>
    </list></t>

        <t>
   For example, assuming three bridge tables in PE1 for the same MAC-VRF
   (each one associated with a different Ethernet Tag, e.g., VLAN-1, VLAN&nbhy;2,
   and VLAN-3), PE1 will advertise three Ethernet A-D per EVI routes for
   ES12. Each of the three routes will indicate the status of each of
   the three ACs in ES12. PE1 will be considered to be a valid candidate PE
   for DF election in &lt;ES12,&nbsp;VLAN-1&gt;, &lt;ES12,&nbsp;VLAN-2&gt;,
   and &lt;ES12,&nbsp;VLAN-3&gt; as long as its three routes are active.
   For instance, if PE1 withdraws
   the Ethernet A-D per EVI routes for &lt;ES12,&nbsp;VLAN-1&gt;, the PEs in ES12
   will not consider PE1 as a suitable DF candidate for &lt;ES12,&nbsp;VLAN-1&gt;.
   PE1 will still be considered for &lt;ES12,&nbsp;VLAN-2&gt; and
   &lt;ES12,&nbsp;VLAN-3&gt;, since its routes are active.</t>

   The solution described in this document provides the following
   benefits:</t>

        <t><list style="format (%c)">
   <t>It extends the DF election as defined in <xref target="RFC7432"/>
   to address the unfair load balancing and potential black-holing issues with
   the default DF election algorithm. The solution is applicable to the
   DF election in EVPN services <xref target="RFC7432"/> and EVPN VPWS
   <xref target="RFC8214"/>.</t>

   <t>It defines a way to signal the DF election algorithm and
      capabilities intended by the advertising PE. This is done by
      defining the DF Election Extended Community, which allows the
      advertising PE to indicate its support for the capabilities defined
      in this document as well as any subsequently defined DF election
      algorithms or capabilities.</t>

   <t>It is backwards compatible with the procedures defined
      in <xref target="RFC7432"/>. If one or more PEs in the ES do not support
      the new procedures, they will all follow DF election as defined in
      <xref target="RFC7432"/>.</t>
    </list></t>

        </section>

        <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="section-6"><t>
   This document addresses some identified issues in the DF election
   procedures described in <xref target="RFC7432"/> by defining a new DF election
   framework. In general, this framework allows the PEs that are part of
   the same ES to exchange additional information and
   agree on the DF election type and capabilities to be used.</t>

        <t>
   By following the procedures in this document, the operator will minimize
   such undesirable situations as unfair load balancing, service disruption,
   and traffic black-holing. Because such situations could be purposely
   created by a malicious user with access to the configuration of one PE,
   this document also enhances the security of the network. Note that the
   network will not benefit from the new procedures if the DF election
   algorithm is not consistently configured on all the PEs in the ES (if there
   is no unanimity among all the PEs, the DF election algorithm falls back to
   the default DF election as provided in <xref target="RFC7432"/>). This
   behavior could be exploited by an attacker that manages to modify the
   configuration of one PE in the ES so that the DF election algorithm and
   capabilities in all the PEs in the ES fall back to the default DF
   election. If that is the case, the PEs will be exposed to the unfair load
   balancing, service disruption, and black&nbhy;holing mentioned earlier.</t>

        <t>
   In addition, the new framework is extensible and allows for new
   security enhancements in the future.  Note that such enhancements
   are out of scope for this document. Finally, since this document extends
   the procedures in <xref target="RFC7432"/>, the same
   security considerations as those described in <xref target="RFC7432"/>
   are valid for this document.</t>
