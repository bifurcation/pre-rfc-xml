    <abstract>
      <t>In Proxy Mobile IPv6, packets received from a Mobile Node (MN) by the
      Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to which it is attached are typically
      tunneled to a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for routing. The term
      "localized routing" refers to a method by which packets are routed
      directly between an MN's MAG and the MAG of its Correspondent Node (CN)
      without involving any LMA. In a Proxy Mobile IPv6 deployment, it may be
      desirable to control the establishment of localized routing sessions
      between two MAGs in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain by requiring that the
      session be authorized. This document specifies how to accomplish this
      using the Diameter protocol.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC5213">Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6)</xref> allows the
      Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to optimize media delivery by locally
      routing packets from a Mobile Node (MN) to a Correspondent Node (CN) that is
      locally attached to an access link connected to the same Mobile Access
      Gateway, avoiding tunneling them to the Mobile Node's Local Mobility
      Anchor (LMA). This is referred to as "local routing" in RFC 5213 <xref target="RFC5213" />.
      However, this mechanism is not applicable to the typical scenarios in
      which the MN and CN are connected to different MAGs and are registered
      to the same LMA or different LMAs. <xref target="RFC6279"></xref> takes
      those typical scenarios into account and defines the problem statement
      for PMIPv6 localized routing. Based on the scenarios A11, A12, and A21 described in <xref target="RFC6279" />, <xref target="RFC6705" /> 
specifies the PMIPv6 localized routing protocol that is used to establish 
a localized routing path between two Mobile Access Gateways in a PMIPv6 domain. 

<vspace
      blankLines="1" />  This document describes Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
  (AAA) support using Diameter <xref target="RFC6733" />  for the authorization procedure
  between the PMIPv6 mobility entities (MAG or LMA) and a AAA server
  within a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain for localized routing in the scenarios
  A11, A12, and A21 described in <xref target="RFC6279" />. </t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Solution Overview">
      <t>This document addresses how to provide authorization information to the Mobile
      Node's MAG or LMA to enable localized routing and resolve the
      destination MN's MAG by means of interaction between the LMA and the AAA
      server. <xref target="ref_arch"></xref> shows the reference architecture
      for Localized Routing Service Authorization. This reference architecture
      assumes that <list style="symbols">
          <t>If the MN and CN belong to different LMAs, the MN and CN should share the
          same MAG (i.e., scenario A12 described in <xref target="RFC6279" />), e.g., MN1 and CN2 in
          <xref target="ref_arch"></xref> are attached to MAG1 and
          belong to LMA1 and LMA2, respectively. Note that LMA1 and LMA2 in
          <xref target="ref_arch"></xref> are in the same provider domain (as
          described in <xref target="RFC6279"></xref>).</t>

          <t>If the MN and CN are attached to different MAGs, the MN and CN should belong to the same LMA (i.e., scenario A21 described in <xref target="RFC6279"/>); for example, MN1 and CN3 in Figure 1 are attached to MAG1 and MAG3, respectively, but belong to LMA1.
</t>

          <t>The MN and CN may belong to the same LMA and may be attached to the same
          MAG (i.e., scenario A11 described in <xref target="RFC6279" />), e.g., MN1 and CN1 in <xref
          target="ref_arch"></xref> are both attached to the MAG1 and belong
          to LMA1.</t>

          <t>The MAG and LMA support Diameter client functionality.</t>

      <section anchor="flagbit" title="MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP">

        <t>  The MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP is defined in <xref target="RFC5447" /> and contains a

  AAA server. This document allocates a new capability flag bit 
  according to the IANA rules in RFC 5447 <xref target="RFC5447" />.</t>

        <t>INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED (0x0002000000000000)<list>
            <t>When set, this flag indicates support or authorization of Direct

          </list></t>
       <t>    During the network access authentication and authorization procedure 
  <xref target="RFC5779" />, this flag is set by the MAG or LMA in the 
  MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP included in the request to indicate to the 
  home AAA server (HAAA) that inter-MAG direct routing may be provided
  to the mobile node identified by the User-Name AVP. By setting the 
  INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED flag in the response, the HAAA indicates
  to the MAG or LMA that direct routing of IP packets between this mobile
  node and another node anchored to a different MAG is authorized.

  The MAG and the LMA set also the INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED flag of 
  the MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP in AA-R sent to the HAAA for requesting 
  authorization of inter-MAG direct routing between the mobile nodes
  identified in the request by two distinct instances of the User-Name AVP.
  If this bit is set in the returned MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP, the HAAA 
  authorizes direct routing of packets between MNs anchored to different MAGs.

  When the INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED flag is cleared, either in request or
  response, it indicates that the procedures related to authorization of 
  localized routing between MNs anchored to different MAGs is not supported
  or not authorized.

  MAG and LMA compliant to this specification MUST support this policy 
  feature on a per-MN and per-subscription basis.</t>

    <section title="Example Signaling Flows for Localized Routing Service Authorization">
      <t>Localized Routing Service Authorization can happen during the network
      access authentication procedure <xref target="RFC5779"/> before
      localized routing is initialized. In this case, the preauthorized pairs
      of LMA / prefix sets can be downloaded to Proxy Mobile IPv6 entities
      during the procedure from <xref target="RFC5779" />. Localized routing can be initiated once
      the destination of a received packet matches one or more of the prefixes
      received during the procedure from <xref target="RFC5779" />.</t>

      <t><xref target="fig2"></xref> shows an example scenario in which MAG1
      acts as a Diameter client, processing the data packet from MN1 to MN2
      and requesting authorization of localized routing (i.e., MAG-Initiated LR
      authorization). In this example scenario, MN1 and MN2 are attached to
      the same MAG and anchored to the different LMAs (i.e., scenario A12 described in
      <xref target="RFC6279"></xref>). In this case, MAG1 knows that MN2
      belongs to a different LMA (which can be determined by looking up the
      binding cache entries corresponding to MN1 and MN2 and comparing the
      addresses of LMA1 and LMA2). In order to set up a localized routing path
      with MAG2, MAG1 acts as Diameter client and sends an AA-Request message to the
      AAA server. The message contains an instance of the
      MIP6-Feature-Vector (MFV) AVP <xref target="RFC5447"></xref> with the LOCAL_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit (<xref
      target="RFC5779"></xref>, Section 5.5) set, two instances of the
      User-Name AVP <xref target="RFC6733"></xref> containing the identifiers of MN1 and MN2.  In addition, the message may contain either:</t>
<t>
  - an instance of the MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix AVP <xref target="RFC5779" /> carrying the MN1's IPv4 address; </t>
<t>  - an instance of the PMIP6-IPv4-Home-Address AVP <xref target="RFC5779" /> carrying the MN1's home network prefix (MN-HNP).</t> <t>The
      AAA server authorizes the localized routing service by checking if MN1
      and MN2 are allowed to use localized routing. If so, the AAA server
      responds with a AAA message encapsulating an instance of the
      MIP6-Feature-Vector (MFV) AVP <xref target="RFC5447"></xref> with the LOCAL_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit (<xref
      target="RFC5779"></xref>, Section 5.5) set indicating that direct routing of
      IP packets between MNs anchored to the same MAG is authorized. MAG1 then
      knows that the localized routing between MN1 and MN2 is allowed. Then, MAG1
      sends the Request messages respectively to LMA1 and LMA2. The request
      message is the Localized Routing Initialization (LRI) message in Figure
      2 and belongs to the Initial phase of the localized routing. LMA1 and
      LMA2 respond to MAG1 using the Localized Routing Acknowledge message
      (LRA in <xref target="fig2"></xref>) in accordance with <xref
      target="RFC6705"></xref>. <vspace blankLines="1" />In
      case of LRA_WAIT_TIME expiration <xref
      target="RFC6705"></xref>, MAG1 should ask for
      authorization of localized routing again according to the procedure
      described above before the LRI is retransmitted up to a maximum of
      LRI_RETRIES.</t>

      this scenario, MN1 and MN2 are attached to a different MAG and
      anchored to the same LMA (i.e., A21 described in <xref target="RFC6279" />), LMA knows

      comparing the addresses of the LMA corresponding to MN1 and LMA
      corresponding to MN2). In contrast with the signaling flow shown in
      <xref target="fig2"></xref>, it is LMA1 instead of MAG1 that initiates
      the setup of the localized routing path. <vspace blankLines="1" /> The
      Diameter client in LMA1 sends an AA-Request message to the AAA

      <t><xref target="fig4"></xref> shows another example scenario, in which
      LMA1 acts as a Diameter client, processing the data packet from MN2 to
      MN1 and requesting the authorization of localized routing. In this
      scenario, MN1 and MN2 are attached to the same MAG and anchored to the
      same LMA (i.e., A11 described in <xref target="RFC6279"></xref>), the LMA
      knows that MN1 and MN2 belong to the same LMA (which can be determined
      by looking up the binding cache entries corresponding to MN1 and MN2 and
      comparing the addresses of LMA corresponding to MN1 and LMA
      corresponding to MN2).</t>

      <t>The Diameter client in LMA1 sends an AA-Request message to the
      AAA server. The message contains an instance of the MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP <xref target="RFC5447"></xref> with
      the LOCAL_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit set and two instances of the User-Name AVP <xref target="RFC6733"></xref> containing the identifiers MN1 and MN2. The AAA server
      authorizes the localized routing service by checking if MN1 and MN2 are
      allowed to use localized routing. If so, the AAA server responds
      with an AA-Answer message encapsulating an instance of the
      MIP6-Feature-Vector (MFV) AVP <xref target="RFC5447"></xref> with the LOCAL_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit (<xref
      target="RFC5779"></xref>, Section 5.5) set indicating that direct routing of
      IP packets between MNs anchored to the same MAG is authorized. LMA1 then
      knows the localized routing is allowed and responds to MAG1 for
      localized routing in accordance with <xref
      target="RFC6705"></xref>.<vspace blankLines="1" />In
      the case of LRA_WAIT_TIME expiration <xref
      target="RFC6705"></xref>, LMA1 should ask for
      authorization of localized routing again according to the procedure
      described above before the LRI is retransmitted up to a maximum of
      LRI_RETRIES.</t>

      <t>The security considerations for the <xref
      target="RFC7155">Diameter Network Access Server Requirements (NASREQ)</xref> and <xref
      target="RFC5779">Diameter Proxy Mobile IPv6</xref> applications are also
      applicable to this document. <vspace blankLines="1" /> The service
      authorization solicited by the MAG or the LMA relies upon the existing
      trust relationship between the MAG/LMA and the AAA server.</t>

      <t>An authorized MAG could, in principle, track the movement of any
      participating mobile nodes at the level of the MAG to which they are anchored. If
      such a MAG were compromised, or under the control of a bad actor, then
      such tracking could represent a privacy breach for the set of tracked
      mobile nodes. In such a case, the traffic pattern from the compromised MAG might
      be notable, so monitoring for, e.g., excessive queries from MAGs, might be
      worthwhile.</t>

<abstract><t>This document describes the Diameter protocol application used for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) services in the Network Access Server (NAS) environment; it obsoletes RFC 4005.  When combined with the Diameter Base protocol, Transport Profile, and Extensible Authentication Protocol specifications, this application specification satisfies typical network access services requirements.</t></abstract>
