<t>IETF Participants must not engage in harassment while at IETF meetings,
virtual meetings, or social events or while participating in mailing lists.  This document lays out
procedures for managing and enforcing this policy.</t>

<t>This document updates RFC 2418 by defining new working group guidelines and
procedures.  This document updates RFC 7437 by allowing the Ombudsteam to form
a recall petition without further signatories.</t>

        <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
<t>The IETF has general policies for managing disruptive behavior in the
context of IETF activities.  In particular, <xref target="RFC7154" /> provides
a set of guidelines for personal interaction in the IETF, and <xref
target="RFC2418" /> and <xref target="RFC3934" /> give guidelines for how to
deal with disruptive behavior that occurs in the context of IETF working group
face-to-face meetings and on mailing lists.</t>

<t>However, there is other problematic behavior that may be more personal and
that can occur in the context of IETF activities (meetings, mailing list
discussions, or social events) that does not directly disrupt working group
progress but nonetheless is unacceptable behavior between IETF Participants.
This sort of behavior, described in the IESG Statement "IETF Anti-Harassment
Policy" <xref target="Policy" />, is not easily dealt with by our previously
existing working group guidelines and procedures. Therefore, this document
sets forth procedures to deal with such harassing behavior.</t>

<t>These procedures are intended to be used when other IETF policies and procedures do not apply or have been ineffective.</t>

<t>Nothing in this document should be taken to interfere with the due process of law.  Similarly, it does not release any person from any contractual or corporate policies to which they may be subject.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="definitions" title="Definitions">
<t>The following terms are used in this document:
     <list style="symbols">
       <t>IETF Participant: Anyone who participates in an IETF activity, including IETF support staff.</t>
       <t>Reporter: An IETF Participant who reports potential harassment to an Ombudsperson.</t>
       <t>Respondent: An IETF Participant who is claimed to have engaged in harassing behavior.</t>
       <t>Ombudsteam: A group of people who have been selected to take reports of potential harassment, evaluate them, and impose appropriate actions and/or remedies to address the circumstances.</t>
       <t>Ombudsperson: A member of the Ombudsteam.</t>
       <t>Lead Ombudsperson: The Ombudsperson assigned to be the primary contact person for a particular report of potential harassment.</t>
       <t>Subject: An individual, group, or class of IETF Participant to whom the potentially harassing behavior was directed or who might be subject to the behavior.</t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>The IESG Statement on harassment <xref target="Policy" /> gives
	    a general definition of harassment as:
<list><t>
unwelcome hostile or intimidating behavior -- in particular, speech or
behavior that is sexually aggressive or intimidates based on attributes such
as race, gender, religion, age, color, national origin, ancestry, disability,
sexual orientation, or gender identity. 
</t>
</list>
This document adopts that general
definition but does not attempt to further precisely define behavior that
falls under the set of procedures identified here, nor does it attempt to list
every possible attribute that might be the basis for harassment, 
except to note that it may 
be targeted at an individual, directed at a specific group of people, or more
generally impact a broader class of people.
</t>

            <t>This document concerns itself with harassment that has the
	    purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's
	    participation in IETF activities or of creating an environment
	    within the IETF that would be intimidating, hostile, or offensive
	    in such a situation.  One way in which harassment can occur is
	    when submission to such conduct is made, either explicitly or
	    implicitly, a term or condition of an individual's participation in IETF activities or is used as a basis for decisions affecting that individual's relationship to the IETF.</t>
            <t>In general, disruptive behavior that occurs in the context of
	    an IETF general or working group mailing list, or happens in a
	    face-to-face or virtual meeting of a working group or the IETF
	    plenary, can be dealt with by our normal procedures, whereas
	    harassing behavior is more appropriately handled by the procedures
	    described here.  However, there are plausible reasons to address
	    behaviors that take place during working group meetings using these procedures.  This document gives some guidance to those involved in these situations in order to decide how to handle particular incidents, but the final decision will involve judgment and the guidance of the Ombudsteam.</t>
            <t>Any definition of harassment prohibited by an applicable law can be subject to this set of procedures. </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="ombudsteam" title="The Ombudsteam">
            <t>This section describes the role of the Ombudsteam in terms of
	    the appointment of Ombudspersons, their qualifications and
	    training, the length of the term of service, any compensation from
	    the IETF for their service, and how they may be removed from
	    service.  The general operational procedures for the Ombudsteam
	    are described in Sections <xref target="handling" format="counter"/>, <xref target="remedies" format="counter"/>, and <xref target="appeals" format="counter"/>.</t>

            <section anchor="size" title="Size of the Ombudsteam">
                <t>The Ombudsteam shall comprise no fewer than three people.  From time to time, the size may fall below that number owing to changes in membership, but the team will be rapidly brought up to size through new appointments.  The team may be grown to a larger size as described in <xref target="appointment" /></t>
            </section>

            <section anchor="appointment" title="Appointing the Ombudsteam">
                <t>The Ombudsteam is appointed by the IETF Chair.  The appointment is solely the responsibility of the IETF Chair, who may choose to consult with members of the IETF community.</t>
                <t>The IETF Chair is encouraged to appoint at least some of the Ombudsteam from within the IETF community.</t>
                <t>The IETF Chair may choose to solicit nominations or advertise the post.  This is entirely at the discretion of the IETF Chair.</t>
                <t>The IETF Chair is also free to decide to appoint more than
		three Ombudspersons to the Ombudsteam.  This may depend on the
		skill sets available, the work load, and the opinions of the seated Ombudsteam.  Furthermore, the IETF Chair may consider elements of diversity in making this decision.</t>
            </section>

            <section anchor="advisors" title="Professional Advisors">
                <t>It is recognized that the Ombudsteam may need to call on
		professional services from external advisors for certain
		matters, including legal and Human Resources (HR) advice.  The
		IETF (via the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA)) is committed to funding such advice as needed.</t>
            </section>

            <section anchor="qualifications" title="Qualifications and Training">
                <t>It is not expected that there will be candidates with all
		of the necessary Ombudsperson skills and training who also
		have a clear understanding and familiarity with the IETF
		processes and culture.  The Chair might choose someone with a
		great deal of professional experience evaluating and mediating
		harassment disputes but little exposure to the IETF or could
		select someone with more exposure to the IETF community but
		without as much experience dealing with issues of harassment.
		Since all of these attributes may be regarded by the IETF
		Chair as essential for the team, the IETF is committed to
		providing training (or funding for it) as deemed necessary for
		appointed Ombudspersons.  In determining the appropriate
		training, the IETF Chair and Ombudsteam shall take
		professional advice and will consult with the IETF
		Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) with respect to the overall IETF budget.</t>
            </section>

            <section anchor="term" title="Term of Service">
                <t>An Ombudsperson shall be appointed for a two-year term.  That is, the Ombudsperson is making a commitment to serve for two years.  It is understood, however, that circumstances may lead an Ombudsperson to resign for personal or other reasons.  See also <xref target="removal" />.</t>
                <t>If an Ombudsperson's term ends while they are acting as
		Lead Ombudsperson for a report as described in <xref target="handling"/>, that Ombudsperson's term shall be extended until the handling of that report has been completed.</t>
                <t>It is entirely at the discretion of the IETF Chair whether
		a serving Ombudsperson is reappointed at the end of their
		term. Given the sensitivity of, and training required for,
		this role and the ideal being a lack of activity, it is
		likely the IETF Chair may choose to reappoint a successful and
		still-willing Ombudsperson for a number of two-year terms.</t>

            </section>

            <section anchor="compensation" title="Compensation">
                <t>An Ombudsperson shall receive no compensation from the IETF for their services.  This includes, but is not limited to:
                    <list style="symbols">
                        <t>IETF meeting fees</t>
                        <t>Remuneration for time spent</t>
                        <t>Out-of-pocket expenses (such as telephone charges)</t>
                        <t>Travel or accommodation expenses</t>
                    </list>
                </t>
                <t>The IETF will, however, meet the costs of training when agreed to by the IETF Chair as described in <xref target="qualifications" />.</t>
            </section>

            <section anchor="removal" title="Removal">
                <t>The IETF Chair may remove a serving Ombudsperson before the end of their term without explanation to the community, including during the course of processing an active case.  Such an action shall be appealable as described in <xref target="chair-appeals" />.</t>
                <t>An Ombudsperson shall not be removed from service, even if their term has expired, during the period that the IETF Chair is recused as described in <xref target="conflict" />.  Once the case that led to the Chair being recused has been closed, normal processes resume.</t>
            </section>

            <section anchor="chair-appeals" title="Disputes with the IETF Chair Regarding the Ombudsteam">
                <t>If an individual should disagree with an action taken by the IETF Chair regarding the appointment, removal, or management of an Ombudsperson or the Ombudsteam, that person should first discuss the issue with the IETF Chair directly.  If the IETF Chair is unable to resolve the issue, the dissatisfied party may appeal to the IESG as a whole.  The IESG shall then review the situation and attempt to resolve it in a manner of its own choosing.  The procedures of Section 6.5.4 of <xref target="RFC2026" /> apply to this sort of appeal.</t>
            </section>
        </section>

        <section anchor="handling" title="Handling Reports of Harassment">
            <t>Any IETF Participant who believes that they have been harassed,
	    or that any other IETF Participant or group of IETF Participants
	    has been or may have been harassed, should bring the concern to
	    the attention of any serving Ombudsperson.  This can be done by
	    email to ombuds@ietf.org or can be done directly to a chosen
	    Ombudsperson.  Direct contact information for the members of the
	    Ombudsteam, including the email addresses to which mail to
	    ombuds@ietf.org is forwarded, can be found at &lt;https://www.ietf.org/ombudsteam&gt; <xref target="OmbudsteamPages" />.</t>
            <t>All IETF Participants are encouraged to talk with the Ombudsteam if they are uncomfortable or unsure about any behaviors. Though much of this document relates to the formal duties of the Ombudsteam, it should be understood that an important function of the Ombudsteam is to provide confidential advice and counsel for any IETF Participant regarding issues of harassment. The Ombudsteam will not commence a formal investigation of any potential incident of harassment without agreement by the Reporter and Subject.</t>
            <t>When a Reporter brings an incident of potential harassment to
	    the attention of the Ombudsteam, a single Ombudsperson shall be
	    designated as the primary contact person (the Lead Ombudsperson)
	    for the report.  
	       When the Reporter contacts a single Ombudsperson, that
	       Ombudsperson shall be the Lead Ombudsperson for the report unless
	       the Reporter and Ombudsperson mutually agree to select another Lead
	       Ombudsperson.</t>
            <t>Information conveyed by the Reporter should be kept in
	    confidence by the Lead Ombudsperson to the greatest extent
	    possible. When necessary (for example, in the course of a formal
	    investigation), the Lead Ombudsperson may share information
	    regarding the report with the rest of the Ombudsteam except when
	    an Ombudsperson is recused (see <xref target="conflict" />).  If a
	    Reporter believes that a member of the Ombudsteam should recuse
	    themself, the Reporter should make this known to the Lead Ombudsperson as soon as possible. See <xref target="operating" /> for further discussion of the confidentiality requirements of the Ombudsteam.</t>
            <t>The Lead Ombudsperson will discuss the events with the Reporter
	    and may give advice, including recommendations on how the Reporter
	    can handle the issue on their own as well as strategies on how to
	    prevent the issue from arising again.  The Lead Ombudsperson may
	    also indicate that the issue would be best handled using regular
	    IETF procedures (such as those for dealing with disruptive
	    behavior) outside the context of harassment, and in this case, the
	    Lead Ombudsperson will provide assistance in using the relevant
	    IETF procedures.  Otherwise, with agreement to proceed from the
	    Subject (or the Reporter if there is no individual Subject), the
	    Ombudsteam may initiate a detailed investigation of the matter and may subsequently, after completing their investigation, impose a remedy as described in <xref target="remedies" />. The Subject can withdraw their agreement to proceed at any time.</t>

            <section anchor="operating" title="Ombudsteam Operating Practices">
                <t>The Ombudsteam is responsible for devising and documenting
		their operating practices.  These practices must be discussed
		with the IESG and published in a publicly visible place (such
		as on the IETF web site).  Discussion with the IETF community
		is encouraged and, while IETF consensus is not necessary,
		significant objections to the processes that are not addressed
		should result in an appeal per Section 6.5.3 of <xref
		target="RFC2026" /> and/or a recall petition against the IETF
		Chair (and any of the rest of the IESG if appropriate) if they
		do not address the concern.</t>
                <t>The practices must include at least the following high-level components:
                    <list style="symbols">
                        <t>Each member of the Ombudsteam is expected to be present at the majority of IETF meetings and to be available for face-to-face discussions.  The Ombudsteam is expected to arrange itself so that there is coverage of every IETF meeting by at least one Ombudsperson.</t>
                        <t>The Ombudsteam shall strive to keep all information
			brought to it in strict confidence.  However, it is
			acknowledged that the operation of the Ombudsteam may
			involve sharing of information within the team and may
			require that the parties to the complaint (the
			Reporter, Respondent, and Subject) learn some of the
			confidential information.  The Ombudsteam is
			responsible for documenting its expectations of when
			disclosures of confidential information are likely to
			be made in the process and to whom.  Any electronic
			information (such as email messages) that needs to be
			archived shall be encrypted before it is stored using
			tools similar to those used by the Nominating
			Committee (NomCom).</t>
                        <t>When conducting a detailed investigation of the circumstances regarding the complaint of harassment, the Ombudsteam may contact the Respondent and request a meeting in person or by a voice call.  The Ombudsteam shall have contacted the Respondent and either discussed the matter or ascertained the Respondent's unwillingness to cooperate prior to deciding to impose a remedy as described in <xref target="remedies" />.  The Respondent is not obliged to cooperate, but the Ombudsteam may consider failure to cooperate when determining a remedy (<xref target="remedies" />).</t>
                        <t>The Ombudsteam shall endeavor to complete its investigation in a timely manner.</t>
                        <t>Any individuals who make a good faith report of
			harassment or who cooperate with an investigation
			shall not be subject to retaliation for reporting,
			complaining, or cooperating, even if the
			investigation, once completed, shows no harassment
			occurred.  Anti-retaliation is noted here to alleviate
			concerns individuals may have with reporting an
			incident they feel should be reviewed or cooperating
			with an investigation.</t>

                        <t>In all cases, the Ombudsteam will strive to
			maintain confidentiality for all parties, including
			the very fact of contact with the Ombudsteam.</t>

                        <t>The results of investigations as reported to the
			Subject or Respondent and all requests for remedial
			action (such as to the IETF Secretariat) shall be in
			writing.</t>

                        <t>The Ombudsteam shall keep written records of their investigation and any contacts or interviews such that there is material available in the event of an appeal or legal action.  Such records shall be held securely and in confidence.</t>
                    </list>
                </t>
                <t> When investigating reports of harassment and determining remedies, it is up to the Ombudsteam whether they choose to act as a body or delegate duties to the Lead Ombudsperson.</t>
            </section>

        </section>

        <section anchor="remedies" title="Remedies">
            <t>After examining the circumstances regarding the complaint of harassment, the Ombudsteam should prepare a brief summary of the incident and their conclusions and discuss this with all parties.  The objective of this step is to make clear what the Ombudsteam has concluded and to make an attempt at getting all parties to reach agreement.</t>
            <t>If the Ombudsteam determines that harassment has taken place, the Ombudsteam is expected to determine the next action.
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>In some cases, a mechanism or established IETF process
		    may already exist for handling the specific event.  In
		    these cases, the Ombudsteam may decide that the
		    misbehavior is best handled with the regular IETF
		    procedures for dealing with disruptive behavior and may
		    assist the Reporter to bring the issue to the attention of
		    the WG Chair or IESG member who can deal with the
		    incident.</t>

                    <t>In other cases, there is a spectrum of remedies that may be appropriate to the circumstances.  At one end of the spectrum, the Ombudsteam might choose to discuss the situation with the Respondent and come up with a plan such that there is no repeat of the harassment.  With the agreement of both parties, the Ombudsteam can also help to mediate a conversation between the Respondent and the Subject (or the Reporter if there is no individual Subject) in order to address the issue.  If mediation fails, then the Ombudsteam can decide to apply other remedies, including those discussed here.</t>
                    <t>At the other end of the spectrum, the Ombudsteam could
		    decide that the Respondent is no longer permitted to
		    participate in a particular IETF activity, for example,
		    ejecting them from a meeting or requiring that the
		    Respondent can no longer attend future meetings to ensure
		    that the reported harassment cannot continue or escalate.
		    If the Respondent holds a management position in the IETF,
		    the remedies imposed may make it difficult or impossible
		    for them to perform the duties required of that position.
		    Further remedies may be applied to Respondents in IETF
		    management positions as described in <xref
		    target="ietfmgmt" />.</t>

                    <t>In determining the appropriate remedy, the Ombudsteam may communicate with the Reporter, Subject, or Respondent in order to assess the impact that the imposition of a remedy might have on any of those parties. However, the Ombudsteam has ultimate responsibility for the choice of remedy.</t>
                    <t>In all cases, the Lead Ombudsperson informs the Respondent of the decision and imposes the remedy as appropriate.  In cases where the remedy is removal from IETF activities, the Lead Ombudsperson will confidentially notify the Secretariat in writing of the remedy such that the Secretariat can take whatever logistical actions are required to effect the remedy.  Only the remedy itself shall be disclosed to the Secretariat, not any information regarding the nature of the harassment.</t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>Where specific action is required to ensure that a remedy is realized or enforced, the Ombudsteam will make a request in writing to the IETF Secretariat and/or IETF Administrative Director (IAD) to take action as appropriate.</t>

            <section anchor="ietfmgmt" title="Remedies for Respondents in IETF Positions">
                <t>The remedies discussed earlier in this section are equally applicable to all IETF Participants regardless of role.</t>
                <t>The Ombudsteam will want to be aware of the impact of
		remedies on the ability of an individual to carry out their
		duties in IETF management positions, but this should not
		dissuade the Ombudsteam from applying remedies that they deem
		appropriate. Per <xref target="remedies" />, the Ombudsteam is
		expected to apply proportionality and reasonableness, as well as
		to consider the impact of the remedy on the Respondent. Per
		<xref target="operating" />, the Ombudsteam may communicate
		with the Respondent in order to assess the impact that the
		remedy might have.</t>

                <t>There may be cases where the Ombudsteam considers that it
		is inappropriate for a Respondent to continue in their IETF
		management position, that is, where the desired remedy is to
		remove the Respondent from their management position.  The
		Ombudsteam cannot by itself remove a Respondent who is in an
		IETF management position from that position.  However, the
		Ombudsteam can recommend the use of existing mechanisms
		within the IETF process for the removal of people from IETF
		management positions as follows:

                    <list style="symbols">
                        <t>Many IETF management positions are appointed by the NomCom with confirmation from the IESG,
                        IAB, or ISOC. <xref target="RFC7437" /> describes the recall procedure for such appointments.  This document
                        updates <xref target="RFC7437" /> by allowing the Ombudsteam to form a recall petition on its own and without
                        requiring 20 signatories from the community.  Such a petition shall be treated in all ways like any other
                        recall petition as described in <xref target="RFC7437" />: that is, the fact of the petition and its
                        signatories (the Ombudsteam) shall be announced to the IETF community, and a Recall Committee Chair shall be
                        appointed to complete the Recall Committee process.  It is expected that the Recall Committee will receive a
                        briefing from the Ombudsteam explaining why recall is considered an appropriate remedy.</t>

                        <t>Other IETF management positions are filled by appointment of the IESG, the IAB, the ISOC Board, or the ISOC President.
                        In such cases, the Ombudsteam may recommend to the appointing body that the Respondent be removed from their position.</t>

                        <t>Many IETF management positions are filled through appointment by an AD or by the ADs for an IETF Area.  In
                        such cases, the Ombudsteam may recommend to those ADs
			in writing that the Respondent be removed from their
			position.</t>


                        <t>Some other IETF management positions are filled through appointment by WG Chairs.  In such cases, the Ombudsteam
                        may make a recommendation in writing to the responsible AD (that is, not directly to the WG Chairs) that the
                        Respondent be removed from their position.</t>
                    </list>
                </t>
<t>In each of the cases listed here, it is expected that the person or body 
   responsible for removing someone from an IETF management position
   will take a recommendation from the Ombudsteam extremely seriously
   and that it would be very unusual for them to not act on the recommendation.
                It is not the
		intent that the person or body attempt to reinvestigate
                the circumstances of the harassment.  They are expected to
		understand that they are not qualified in evaluating or
		handling
                issues of harassment.  They must seek to preserve
		confidentiality.  If the person or body feels removal from
		position is not
                the correct remedy, they must discuss their concern with the Ombudsteam.</t>

                <t>In the event that an AD declines to follow the recommendation of the Ombudsteam, and if the AD fails to convince the
                Ombudsteam of the reasons for this, the Ombudsteam should raise the issue with the whole IESG while continuing to attempt
                to retain confidentiality.  The IESG may choose to reorganize the responsibilities for working groups within its own structure
                so that the AD concerned is no longer in the direct management path.</t>

                <t>All such forced removals from management positions must be
		considered by the Ombudsteam as acts of last resort. That is,
		before a Respondent is recommended for removal, the Ombudsteam
		should consider other possible remedies and should discuss the
		situation with the Respondent, giving them ample opportunity to understand what might happen and to step down of their own volition.</t>
                <t>As described in <xref target="operating" />, the Ombudsteam is required to maintain the highest degree of confidentiality. In recommending action as described above, the Ombudsteam will clearly have to indicate that some event has occurred that led to their recommendation, but it is not expected that the Ombudsteam will need to divulge substantially more information. It should be enough that the Ombudsteam explains the severity of the situation, that they have considered other lesser remedies, and that they deem the recommended remedy to be appropriate.</t>
                <t>In removing someone from their position, it may become apparent to the IETF community that the removal is a remedy recommended by the Ombudsteam. However, revealing the underlying events should be avoided as far as possible.</t>
            </section>

            <section anchor="punishment" title="Purpose of Remedies">
                <t>The purpose of the anti-harassment policy is to prevent all incidents of harassment in the IETF.   The set of procedures documented here serves to provide a mechanism whereby any harassment that occurs can be reported and handled both sympathetically and effectively. The policy also sends a clear message that the IETF does not tolerate harassment in any form.</t>
                <t>However, any remedy is imposed to try to make sure that the incident does not escalate and to ensure that a similar situation is unlikely to occur with the same Respondent in the future.</t>
                <t>Because the handling of incidents of harassment (including
		the imposition of remedies) is confidential, an imposed remedy
		cannot itself serve as a deterrent to others, nor can it be
		used to "teach" the community how to behave. (<xref
		target="RFC7154" /> gives guidelines for conduct in the
		IETF.) Furthermore, a remedy is not to be imposed for the
		purposes of retribution. However, the knowledge of the
		existence of a range of remedies and of processes by which
		they can be applied serves both as a statement of the IETF's
		seriousness in this matter and as a deterrent to potential
		offenders.</t>

                <t>The Ombudsteam is expected to apply the above considerations, as well as proportionality and reasonableness, in selecting a remedy. They are asked to consider the impact of the remedy on the Respondent as well as on the Subject.</t>
            </section>

        </section>

        <section anchor="appeals" title="Disputes with the Ombudsteam">
            <t>If either the Subject (or the Reporter if there is no individual Subject) or the Respondent is dissatisfied with the decision of the Ombudsteam, the dissatisfied party should first contact the Lead Ombudsperson and discuss the situation. If the issue cannot be resolved through discussion with the Lead Ombudsperson, the issue may be raised with the IETF Chair.</t>
            <t>If necessary, the IETF Chair may recuse themself from any part of this process (see <xref target="conflict" />) and request the IESG to select another of its members to serve in this role.  This IESG member is known as the "delegated IESG member".</t>
            <t>The IETF Chair (or the delegated IESG member if the Chair is
	    recused) will attempt to resolve the issue in discussion with the
	    dissatisfied party and the Lead Ombudsperson.  If this further
	    discussion does not bring a satisfactory resolution, the
	    Ombudsteam's decision may be formally appealed.  The appeal is
	    strictly on the issue of whether the Ombudsteam exercised due
	    diligence both in their decision as to whether harassment had
	    taken place as well as in their determination of any appropriate
	    remedy that was imposed.  In particular, the purpose of the appeal
	    is not to re-investigate the circumstances of the incident or to
	    negotiate the severity of the remedy.</t>

            <t>All elements of the appeal, including the fact of the appeal, will be held in confidence but will be recorded and held securely for future reference.</t>
            <t>The appeal will be evaluated by the IETF Chair  (or the
	    delegated IESG member) and two other members of the IESG selected
	    by the IETF Chair  (or the delegated IESG member) and confirmed by
	    the appellant.  This Appeals Group shall convene as quickly as
	    possible to evaluate and determine the appeal.  Where the impacts
	    are immediate and related to participation in an ongoing meeting,
	    this shall happen in no more than 24 hours after receiving the
	    appeal. The Appeals Group may ask the appellant and the Lead
	    Ombudsperson for statements or other information to consider.  If
	    the Appeals Group concludes that due diligence was exercised by
	    the Ombudsteam, this shall be reported to the appellant, and the
	    matter is concluded.  If the Appeals Group finds that due
	    diligence was not exercised, the Appeals Group shall report this
	    to the Ombudsteam and consult with the Ombudsteam on how to
	    complete the due diligence.</t>

            <t>Because of the need to keep the information regarding these matters as confidential as possible, the Appeals Group's decision is final with respect to the question of whether the Ombudsteam has used due diligence in their decision.  The only further recourse available is to claim that the procedures themselves (i.e., the procedures described in this document) are inadequate or insufficient to the protection of the rights of all parties.  Such a claim may be made in an appeal to the Internet Society Board of Trustees, as described in Section 6.5.3 of <xref target="RFC2026" />.  Again, even in this circumstance, the particulars of the incident at hand will be held in confidence.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="conflict" title="Conflicts of Interest">
            <t>In the event of any conflict of interest, the conflicted person (member of the Ombudsteam, member of the Appeals Group, IETF Chair, etc.) is expected to recuse themselves.</t>
            <t>A conflict of interest may arise if someone involved in the
	    process of handling a harassment report is in the role of
	    Reporter, Respondent, or Subject.  Furthermore, a conflict of
	    interest arises if the person involved in the process of handling
	    a harassment report is closely associated personally or through
	    affiliation with any of the Reporter, Respondent, or Subject.</t>

            <t>For the avoidance of doubt, recusal in this context means completely stepping out of any advisory or decision-making part of any process associated with handling a harassment report, remedy arising from a harassment report, or appeal into the handling of a harassment report. That means that a recused person has no more right to participate in or witness the process than any other person from the community in the same situation. For example, an Ombudsperson subject to a complaint of harassment shall not be privy to the deliberations of another Ombudsperson handling the report. Nor would an IESG member who was party to an appeal be able to witness the discussions of the Appeals Group.</t>
            <t>In the event that there is an appeal and the IETF Chair is
	    somehow involved, the Chair will immediately recuse themself, and
	    the IESG will select a single person to take the Chair's role in
	    the appeal process as described in <xref target="appeals" />.</t>

        </section>

        <section anchor="confidentiality" title="Confidentiality">
            <t>Throughout this document, there are mentions of requirements to keep information confidential.  This section summarizes those requirements for clarity.</t>
            <t>The Ombudsteam is expected to strive for confidentiality.  Confidentiality protects the Reporter, Subject, and Respondent in any case of alleged harassment.  It also protects witnesses or others consulted by the Ombudsteam during their investigation.</t>
            <t>The Ombudsteam will keep its email and other archival records in a secure system and will not discuss details of any case beyond what is necessary for executing a thorough investigation.</t>
            <t>Third-party receivers of output from the Ombudsteam (for example, ADs or the IETF Secretariat who are asked to take action) are required to keep such output confidential.</t>
            <t>Participants in an investigation (Reporters, Subjects, Respondents, and anyone interviewed by the Ombudsteam during an investigation) are requested to keep the details of the events and investigation confidential.</t>
            <t>It is likely that members of the community will want to know more when they have become aware of some details of a case of harassment.  The community is asked to show restraint and to trust the Ombudsteam.  This process is designed to provide remedies not punishment, as described in <xref target="punishment" />, and public discussion of the events or remedies does not form part of this process.</t>
