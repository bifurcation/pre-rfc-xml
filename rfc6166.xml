  <abstract>
    <t>This document provides instructions to IANA for the creation of
      a registry for PIM message types. It specifies the initial content of
      the registry, based on existing RFCs specifying PIM message types.
      It also specifies a procedure for registering new types.</t>
    <t>In addition to this, one message type is reserved, and may be
      used for a future extension of the message type space.</t>
  </abstract>

  <section title="Introduction">
    <t>Apart from this document, there is no existing document
specifying a registry for PIM message types. PIM version 1 made use of IGMP
<xref target="RFC1112"/>, and there is an IGMP registry <xref target="IGMPREG"/>
listing the message types used by PIM version 1. PIM version 2, however, is not
based on IGMP, and a separate PIM message type registry is needed. There are
currently several RFCs specifying new PIM version 2 message types that should
be in this new registry. They are the RFCs for PIM Dense Mode
<xref target="RFC3973"/>, PIM Sparse Mode <xref target="RFC4601"/>, and
Bidirectional PIM <xref target="RFC5015"/>.
</t><t>This document specifies the initial content of the new PIM message type
registry, based on those existing RFCs. This document also specifies a
procedure for registering new PIM message types.</t>
<t>In addition to this, this document reserves one message type. This type
may be used for a future extension of the message type space.
The current message type space is only 4 bits, so it is not unlikely that
this will be needed.
How exactly the extension should be done is left to a future document.
</t>
  </section>

  <section title="Security Considerations">
    <t>This document only creates an IANA registry. There may be a
security benefit in a well-known place for finding information on which
PIM message types are valid and how they are used. Apart from that, there are
no security considerations.</t>
  </section>

  <section title="IANA Considerations">
    <t>IANA has created a PIM message type
registry. It has been placed in the "Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)"
branch of the tree. Each entry in the registry consists of a message type,
a message name, and references to the documents defining the type.
The message type is a 4-bit integer with possible values from 0 to&nbsp;15.</t>

    <section title="Initial Registry">
      <t>The initial content of the registry should be as follows.

    <t>Thanks to Toerless Eckert for his suggestion to reserve a type
