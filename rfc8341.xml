  <abstract>
   <t>
    The standardization of network configuration interfaces for use
    with the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) or the
    RESTCONF protocol requires a structured and secure
    operating environment that promotes human usability and
    multi-vendor interoperability.  There is a need for standard
    mechanisms to restrict NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol access for particular
    users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
    RESTCONF protocol operations and content.
    This document defines such an access control model.
   </t>
   <t>
     This document obsoletes RFC 6536.

  <section title="Introduction">
    <t>
      The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) and the RESTCONF protocol
      do not provide any standard mechanisms to restrict the protocol
      operations and content that each user is authorized to access.
    </t>
    <t>
      There is a need for interoperable management of the
      controlled access to administrator-selected portions of the
      available NETCONF or RESTCONF content within a particular server.
    </t>
    <t>
      This document addresses access control mechanisms for the
      Operations and Content layers of NETCONF, as defined in <xref
      target="RFC6241"/>; and RESTCONF, as defined
      in <xref target="RFC8040" />.

    </t>
    <t>
      YANG version 1.1 <xref target="RFC7950"/>
      adds two new constructs that need special access control
      handling. The "action" statement is similar to the "rpc"
      statement, except that it is located within a data node.
      The "notification" statement can also be located within
      a data node.

    <section title="Changes since RFC 6536">

      <t>
        The NACM procedures and data model have been updated to
        support new data modeling capabilities in version&nbsp;1.1 of
        the YANG data modeling language.
        The "action" and "notification" statements can be used within
        data nodes to define data-model-specific operations and
        notifications.
      </t>
      <t>
        An important use case for these new YANG
        statements is the increased access control granularity
        that can be achieved over top-level "rpc" and "notification"
        statements.  The new "action" and "notification" statements
        are used within data nodes, and access to the action or
        notification can be restricted to specific instances
        of these data nodes.
      </t>
      <t>
        Support for the RESTCONF protocol has been added.
        The RESTCONF operations are similar to the NETCONF operations,
        so a simple mapping to the existing NACM procedures
        and data model is possible.
      </t>
      <t>
        The data node access behavior for path matches has been
        clarified to also include matching descendant nodes of the
        specified path.
      </t>
      <t>
        The &lt;edit-config&gt; operation access rights behavior has
        been clarified to indicate that write access is not required
        for data nodes that are implicitly modified through
        side&nbsp;effects (such as the evaluation of YANG when-stmts, or
        data nodes implicitly deleted when creating a data node under
        a different branch under a YANG choice-stmt).
      </t>

      <t>
        The Security Considerations section has been updated to comply
        with the "YANG module security guidelines" <xref target="YANG-SEC"/>.
        Note that the YANG module in this document does not define any
        RPC operations.
      </t>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section title="Access Control Design Objectives">

    <t>
      This section documents the design objectives for the NETCONF
      access control model presented in <xref target="acm"/>.
    </t>

    <section title="Access Control Points">
      <t>
        NETCONF allows server implementers to add new custom
        protocol operations, and the YANG data modeling language
        supports this feature.  These operations can be defined
        in standard or proprietary YANG modules.
      </t>
      <t>
        It is not possible to design an ACM for NETCONF that only
        focuses on a static set of standard protocol operations
        defined by NETCONF itself, like some other protocols.  Since
        few assumptions can be made about an arbitrary protocol operation,
        the NETCONF architectural server components need to be protected
        at three conceptual control points.
      </t>
      <t>
        These access control points, described in <xref
        target="control_points"/>, are as follows:
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="protocol operation:">
            Permission to invoke specific protocol operations.
          </t>
          <t hangText="datastore:">
            Permission to read and/or alter
            specific data nodes within any datastore.
          </t>
          <t hangText="notification:">
            Permission to receive
            specific notification event types.

    <section title="Simplicity">
      <t>
        There is concern that a complicated ACM will not be widely deployed
        because it is too hard to use. Configuration of the access control
        system needs to be as simple as possible.  Simple and common tasks
        need to be easy to configure and require little expertise or
        domain&nbhy;specific knowledge.  Complex tasks are possible using
        additional mechanisms that may require additional expertise.
      </t>
      <t>
        A single set of access control rules ought to be able
        to control all types of NETCONF protocol operation invocation,
        all datastore access, and all notification events.
      </t>
      <t>
        Access control ought to be defined with a small and familiar
        set of permissions, while still allowing full control
        of datastore access.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Procedural Interface">
      <t>
        NETCONF uses a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) model and an
        extensible set of protocol operations. Access control for any
        possible protocol operation is necessary.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Datastore Access">
      <t>
        It is necessary to control access to specific nodes and
        subtrees within the datastore, regardless of which
        protocol operation -- standard or proprietary -- was used to
        access the datastore.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Users and Groups">
      <t>
        It is necessary that access control rules for a single user or
        a configurable group of users can be configured.
      </t>
      <t>
        The ACM needs to support the concept of administrative groups,
        to support the well-established distinction between
        a root account and other types of less-privileged
        conceptual user accounts.
        These groups need to be configurable by the administrator.
      </t>
      <t>
        It is necessary that the user-to-group mapping can be
        delegated to a central server, such as a RADIUS server <xref
        target="RFC2865"/> <xref target="RFC5607"/>.  Since
        authentication is performed by the transport layer
        and RADIUS performs authentication and service authorization
        at the same time, the underlying transport protocol needs to be
        able to report a set of group names associated with the user
        to the server.  It is necessary that the administrator can
        disable the usage of these group names within the ACM.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Maintenance">
      <t>
        It ought to be possible to disable part or all of the
        access control model enforcement procedures without deleting any
        access control rules.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Configuration Capabilities">
      <t>
        Suitable configuration and monitoring mechanisms
        are needed to allow an administrator to easily manage all
        aspects of the ACM's behavior. A standard data model,
        suitable for use with the &lt;edit-config&gt;
        protocol operation,
        needs to be available for this purpose.
      </t>
      <t>
        Access control rules to restrict access operations on specific
        subtrees within the configuration datastore need to
        be supported.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Identifying Security-Sensitive Content">
      <t>
        One of the most important aspects of the data model
        documentation, and one of the biggest concerns during
        deployment, is the identification of security-sensitive content.
        This applies to protocol operations in NETCONF, not just data
        and notifications.
      </t>
      <t>
        It is mandatory for security-sensitive objects
        to be documented in the Security Considerations
        section of an RFC.  This is nice, but it
        is not good enough, for the following reasons:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            This documentation-only approach forces administrators to
            study the RFC and determine if there are any
            potential security risks introduced by a new
            data model.
          </t>
          <t>
            If any security risks are identified, then
            the administrator must study some more RFC text
            and determine how to mitigate the security risk(s).
          </t>
          <t>
            The ACM on each server must be configured to
            mitigate the security risks, e.g., require
            privileged access to read or write the
            specific data identified in the Security
            Considerations section.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the ACM is not preconfigured, then there
            will be a time window of vulnerability
            after the new data model is loaded and before
            the new access control rules for that data model
            are configured, enabled, and debugged.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Often, the administrator just wants to disable
        default access to the secure content so that
        no inadvertent or malicious changes can be made
        to the server.  This allows the default rules
        to be more lenient, without significantly
        increasing the security risk.
      </t>
      <t>
        A data model designer needs to be able to
        use machine-readable statements to identify
        content that needs to be protected by default.
        This will allow client and server tools to automatically
        identify data-model-specific security risks, by
        denying access to sensitive data unless the user is
        explicitly authorized to perform the requested access operation.
      </t>

  <section title="NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM)"
           anchor="acm">
    <section title="Overview">
      <t>
        This section provides a high-level overview of the
        access control model structure.  It describes the
        NETCONF protocol message processing model and the conceptual
        access control requirements within that model.
      </t>

      <section title="Features">
        <t>
          The NACM data model provides the following features:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Independent control of RPC, action, data, and
              notification access is provided.
            </t>
            <t>
              The concept of an emergency recovery session
              is supported, but configuration of the server
              for this purpose is beyond the scope of this document.
              An emergency recovery session will bypass all access
              control enforcement, in order to allow it to
              initialize or repair the NACM configuration.
            </t>
            <t>
              A simple and familiar set of datastore permissions is
              used.
            </t>
            <t>
              Support for YANG security tagging (e.g., a
              "nacm:default&nbhy;deny&nbhy;write" statement) allows default
              security modes to automatically exclude sensitive data.
            </t>
            <t>
              Separate default access modes for read, write, and
              execute permissions are provided.
            </t>
            <t>
              Access control rules are applied to configurable groups

          The following diagram shows the conceptual message

        <t>
          RESTCONF operations are mapped to the access control model
          based on the HTTP method and resource class used in the operation.
          For example, a POST method on a data resource is considered
          "write data node" access, but a POST method on an operation
          resource is considered "operation" access.

        <t>
          The new "pre-read data node acc. ctl" boxes in the diagram below
          refer to group read access as it relates to data node ancestors
          of an action or notification. As an example, if an action is
          defined as /interfaces/interface/reset-interface, the group
          must be authorized to (1)&nbsp;read /interfaces and
          /interfaces/interface and (2)&nbsp;execute on
          /interfaces/interface/reset-interface.

          The following high-level sequence of conceptual processing steps
          is executed for each received &lt;rpc&gt; message,
          if access control enforcement is enabled:
         <list style="symbols">

           <t>
     For each active session, access control is applied individually to all
     &lt;rpc&gt; messages (except &lt;close-session&gt;)
     received by the server, unless
     the session is identified as a recovery session.
           </t>
           <t>
             If the &lt;action&gt; operation defined in <xref
             target="RFC7950"/> is invoked, then read access is
             required for all instances in the hierarchy of data nodes
             that identifies the specific action in the datastore, and
             execute access is required for the action node.  If the
             user is not authorized to read all the specified data
             nodes and execute the action, then the request is
             rejected with an "access&nbhy;denied" error.
           </t>
           <t>
             Otherwise, if the user is not authorized to execute the
             specified protocol operation, then the request is
             rejected with an "access&nbhy;denied" error.
           </t>
           <t>
             If a datastore
             is accessed by the protocol operation, then the server
             checks to see if the client is authorized to access the nodes
             in the datastore.  If the user is not authorized to perform
             the requested access operation on the requested data,
             then the request is rejected with an "access&nbhy;denied"
             error.
           </t>
         </list>
       </t>

       <t>
         The following sequence of conceptual processing steps
         is executed for each generated notification event,
         if access control enforcement is enabled:
         <list style="symbols">
           <t>
             Server instrumentation generates a notification

           <t>
             If the "notification" statement is specified within a data
             subtree, as specified in <xref target="RFC7950"/>, then
             read access is required for all instances in the
             hierarchy of data nodes that identifies the specific
             notification in the datastore, and read access is
             required for the notification node.  If the user is not
             authorized to read all the specified data nodes and the
             notification node, then the notification is dropped for
             that subscription.

           <t>
             If the "notification" statement is a top-level statement,
             the notification access control enforcer checks the
             notification event type, and if it is one that the user
             is not authorized to read, then the notification is
             dropped for that subscription.

      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Datastore Access">
      <t>
        The same access control rules apply to all
        datastores that support the NACM -- for example,
        the candidate configuration datastore or the running
        configuration datastore.
      </t>
      <t>
        All conventional configuration datastores and the operational
        state datastore are controlled by the NACM.  Local files,
        remote files, or datastores accessed via the &lt;url&gt;
        parameter are not controlled by the&nbsp;NACM.
      </t>

      <section title="Mapping New Datastores to NACM">
        <t>
          It is possible that new datastores will be defined
          over time for use with NETCONF. The NACM MAY be applied
          to other datastores that have similar access rights as
          defined in the NACM.

          To apply the NACM to a new datastore, the new datastore
          specification needs to define how it maps to the NACM CRUDX
          (Create, Read, Update, Delete, eXec) access rights. It is possible
          that only a subset of the NACM access rights would be applicable.
          For example, only retrieval access control would be needed for a
          read&nbhy;only datastore.

          Operations and access rights not supported by the NACM CRUDX
          model are outside the scope of this document.
          A datastore does not need to use the NACM, e.g., the datastore
          specification defines something else or does not use
          access control.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Access Rights">
        <t>
          A small set of hard-wired datastore access rights is needed
          to control access to all possible protocol operations,
          including vendor extensions to the standard protocol operation set.
        </t>
        <t>
          The CRUDX model can support all protocol operations:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Create: allows the client to add a new data node
              instance to a datastore.
            </t>
            <t>
              Read: allows the client to read a data node instance
              from a datastore or receive the notification event type.
            </t>

              Update: allows the client to update an existing data
              node instance in a datastore.
            </t>
            <t>
              Delete: allows the client to delete a data node
              instance from a datastore.
            </t>
            <t>
              eXec: allows the client to execute the operation.

          </list>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="RESTCONF Methods">
        <t>
          The RESTCONF protocol utilizes HTTP methods to perform
          datastore operations, similar to NETCONF.
          The NACM procedures were originally written for
          NETCONF protocol operations, so the RESTCONF methods
          are mapped to NETCONF operations for the purpose of
          access control processing.  The enforcement procedures
          described within this document apply to both protocols
          unless explicitly stated otherwise.
        </t>
        <t>
          The request URI needs to be considered when processing
          RESTCONF requests on data resources:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              For HEAD and GET requests, any data nodes
              that are ancestor nodes of the target resource are
              considered to be part of the retrieval request for
              access control purposes.
            </t>
            <t>
              For PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests, any data nodes
              that are ancestor nodes of the target resource are not
              considered to be part of the edit request for access
              control purposes. The access operation for these nodes is
              considered to be "none". The edit begins at the
              target resource.
            </t>
            <t>
              For POST requests on data resources, any data nodes
              that are specified in the request URI, including the
              target resource, are not considered to be part of the
              edit request for access control purposes.
              The access operation for these nodes is considered
              to be "none". The edit begins at a child
              node of the target resource, specified in the message body.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          Not all RESTCONF methods are subject to access control.
          The following table specifies how each method is
          mapped to NETCONF protocol operations. The value "none"
          indicates that the NACM is not applied at all to the specific

      <section title="&lt;get&gt; and &lt;get-config&gt; Operations">
        <t>
          The NACM access rights are not directly coupled to the
          &lt;get&gt; and &lt;get-config&gt; protocol operations
          but apply to all &lt;rpc&gt; operations that would result
          in a "read" access operation to the target datastore.
          This section describes how these access rights apply to the
          specific access operations supported by the &lt;get&gt;
          and &lt;get&nbhy;config&gt; protocol operations.
        </t>
        <t>
          Data nodes to which the client does not have read access are
          silently omitted, along with any descendants,
          from the &lt;rpc-reply&gt; message.  This
          is done to allow NETCONF filters for &lt;get&gt; and
          &lt;get-config&gt; to function properly, instead of causing
          an "access&nbhy;denied" error because the filter criteria would
          otherwise include unauthorized read access to some data
          nodes.  For NETCONF filtering purposes, the selection
          criteria are applied to the subset of nodes that the user is
          authorized to read, not the entire datastore.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="&lt;edit-config&gt; Operation">
        <t>
          The NACM access rights are not directly coupled to the
          &lt;edit-config&gt; "operation" attribute, although they are
          similar.  Instead, a NACM access right applies to all
          protocol operations that would result in a particular access
          operation to the target datastore.

          This section describes
          how these access rights apply to the specific access
          operations supported by the &lt;edit-config&gt; protocol operation.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the effective access operation is "none"
          (i.e., default&nbhy;operation="none")
          for a particular data node,
          then no access control is applied to that data node.
          This is required to allow access to a subtree within
          a larger data structure.  For example, a user may be
          authorized to create a new "/interfaces/interface" list entry
          but not be authorized to create or delete its
          parent container ("/interfaces").
          If the "/interfaces" container already exists in
          the target datastore, then the effective operation
          will be "none" for the "/interfaces" node if an
          "/interfaces/interface" list entry is edited.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the protocol operation would result in the
          creation of a datastore node and the user does not
          have "create" access permission for that node, the
          protocol operation is rejected with an
          "access&nbhy;denied" error.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the protocol operation would result in the
          deletion of a datastore node and the user does not
          have "delete" access permission for that node, the
          protocol operation is rejected with an
          "access&nbhy;denied" error.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the protocol operation would result in the
          modification of a datastore node and the user does
          not have "update" access permission for that node,

          A "merge" or "replace" &lt;edit-config&gt; operation may
          include data nodes that do not alter portions of the
          existing datastore.  For example, a container or list node
          may be present for naming purposes but does not actually
          alter the corresponding datastore node.  These unaltered
          data nodes are ignored by the server and do not require any
          access rights by the client.

          A "merge" &lt;edit-config&gt; operation may include data

          the scope of a "merge" &lt;edit-config&gt; operation are

        <t>
          An &lt;edit-config&gt; operation may cause data nodes to be
          implicitly created or deleted as an implicit side&nbsp;effect of
          a requested operation.  For example, a YANG when-stmt
          expression may evaluate to a different result, causing data
          nodes to be deleted, or created with default values; or if a
          data node is created under one branch of a YANG choice-stmt,
          then all data nodes under the other branches are implicitly
          removed.  No NACM access rights are required on any data
          nodes that are implicitly changed as a side effect of
          another allowed operation.

    <section title="Model Components">
      <t>
        This section defines the conceptual components
        related to the access control model.
      </t>

     <section title="Users">
       <t>
         A "user" is the conceptual entity that is associated
         with the access permissions granted to a particular session.
         A user is identified by a string that is unique
         within the server.
       </t>
       <t>
         As described in <xref target="RFC6241"/>,
         the username string is derived from the transport layer
         during session establishment.  If the transport layer cannot
         authenticate the user, the session is terminated.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Groups">
       <t>
          Access to a specific NETCONF protocol operation is granted to a
          session.  The session is associated with a group (i.e., not with a
          user).
       </t>
       <t>
         A group is identified by its name.  All group names are
         unique within the server.
       </t>
       <t>
         Access control is applied at the level of groups.
         A group contains zero or more group members.
       </t>
       <t>
         A group member is identified by a username string.
       </t>
       <t>
         The same user can be a member of multiple groups.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Emergency Recovery Session">
       <t>
         The server MAY support a recovery session mechanism,
         which will bypass all access control enforcement.
         This is useful for restricting initial access
         and repairing a broken access control configuration.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Global Enforcement Controls">
       <t>
         There are five global controls that are used to
         help control how access control is enforced.
       </t>
       <section title="enable-nacm Switch">
       <t>
         A global "enable-nacm" on/off switch is provided to enable
         or disable all access control enforcement.
         When this global switch is set to "true", all requests
         are checked against the access control rules
         and only permitted if configured to allow the
         specific access request.
         When this global switch is set to "false", all access requests
         are permitted.
       </t>
       </section>
       <section title="read-default Switch">

         An on/off "read-default" switch is provided to
         enable or disable default access

         When this global switch is set to "deny" and no matching
         access control rule is found for the datastore read or
         notification event requested, access is denied.
         This means that the requested data is not sent to the client.

         When the "enable-nacm" global switch is set to "true", this
         global switch is relevant if no matching
         access control rule is found to explicitly
         permit or deny write access to the requested
         datastore data.

       <t>
         When this global switch is set to "permit" and no matching

       <section title="enable-external-groups Switch" anchor="enable-external-groups">
         <t>
           When this global switch is set to "true", the group names
           reported by the transport layer for a session are

   <section title="Access Control Enforcement Procedures">
     <t>
       There are six separate phases that need to be addressed,
       four of which are related to the NETCONF message processing model
       (<xref target="message-proc-model" />):</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
      <t>Initial operation</t>
      <t>Session establishment</t>
      <t>"access-denied" error handling</t>
      <t>Incoming RPC message validation</t>
      <t>Data node access validation</t>
      <t>Outgoing &lt;notification&gt; authorization</t>
      </list></t>

     <t>In addition, the initial startup mode for a NETCONF server, session
       establishment, and "access&nbhy;denied" error-handling procedures also
       need to be considered.
     </t>

     <t>
       The server MUST use the access control rules in effect
       at the time it starts processing the message.
       The same access control rules MUST stay in effect for
       the processing of the entire message.
     </t>

     <section title="Initial Operation">
       <t>
         Upon the very first startup of the NETCONF server,
         the access control configuration will probably
         not be present.  If it isn't,
         a server MUST NOT allow any write access to
         any session role except a recovery session.
       </t>
       <t>
         Access rules are enforced any time a
         request is initiated from a user session.
         Access control is not enforced for
         server-initiated access requests, such as the
         initial load of the running configuration datastore, during bootup.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Session Establishment">
       <t>
         The access control model applies specifically
         to the well-formed XML content transferred between a client
         and a server after session establishment has been completed
         and after the &lt;hello&gt; exchange has been successfully
         completed.
       </t>
       <t>
         Once session establishment is completed and a user
         has been authenticated, the transport layer reports
         the username and a possibly empty set of group names
         associated with the user to the NETCONF server.  The NETCONF
         server will enforce the access control rules, based on the
         supplied username, group names, and the configuration
         data stored on the server.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title='"access-denied" Error Handling'>
       <t>
         The "access-denied" error-tag is generated when
         the access control system denies access to either a
         request to invoke a protocol operation or a request to
         perform a particular access operation on the configuration
         datastore.
       </t>
       <t>
         A server MUST NOT include any information the client is not
         allowed to read in any &lt;error-info&gt; elements within the
         &lt;rpc-error&gt; response.

       <t>
         After the server validates the &lt;rpc&gt; element
         and determines the namespace URI and the element
         name of the protocol operation being requested, the server
         verifies that the user is authorized
         to invoke the protocol operation.
       </t>
       <t>
         The server MUST separately authorize every protocol operation
         by following these steps:
         <list style="numbers">

             If the "enable-nacm" leaf is set to "false", then the

           <t>
             If the requested operation is the NETCONF

   <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
     <t>
       The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for
       data that is designed to be accessed via network management
       protocols such as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> or
       RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>.
       The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer,
       and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell
       (SSH) <xref target="RFC6242"/>. The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS,
       and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
       <xref target="RFC5246"/>.
     </t>
     <t>
       The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means
       to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users
       to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF
       protocol operations and content.
     </t>

     <t>
   There is a risk related to the lack of access control enforcement for the
   RESTCONF OPTIONS and PATCH methods.  The risk here is that the response to
   OPTIONS and PATCH may vary based on the presence or absence of a resource
   corresponding to the URL's path.  If this is the case, then it can be
   used to trivially probe for the presence or absence of values within
   a tree.  Therefore, a server MUST NOT vary its responses
   based on the existence of the underlying resource, which would
   indicate the presence or absence of resource instances. In particular,
   servers should not expose any instance information before ensuring
   that the client has the necessary access permissions to obtain that
   information. In such cases, servers are expected to always return
   the "access&nbhy;denied" error response.
     </t>

     <t>
       There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module
       that are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true,
       which is the default). These data nodes may be considered
       sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
       Write operations (e.g., edit&nbhy;config) to these
       data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect
       on network operations. These are the subtrees and data nodes
       and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
       <list style="symbols">
         <t>
           /nacm: The entire /nacm subtree is related to security.

     </t>

     <t>
       This section highlights the issues for an administrator
       to consider when configuring a NETCONF server with the NACM.
     </t>

     <section title="NACM Configuration and Monitoring Considerations">
       <t>
         Configuration of the access control system is
         highly sensitive to system security.  A server may
         choose not to allow any user configuration to
         some portions of it, such as the global security level
         or the groups that allowed access to system resources.
       </t>
       <t>
         By default, NACM enforcement is enabled.
         By default, "read" access to all datastore contents is enabled
         (unless "nacm:default-deny-all" is specified for the data definition),
         and "exec" access is enabled for safe protocol operations.
         An administrator needs to ensure that the NACM is enabled
         and also decide if the default access parameters are
         set appropriately.  Make sure that the following data nodes
         are properly configured:
         <list style="symbols">
           <t>/nacm/enable-nacm (default "true")</t>
           <t>/nacm/read-default (default "permit")</t>
           <t>/nacm/write-default (default "deny")</t>
           <t>/nacm/exec-default (default "permit")</t>
         </list>
       </t>
       <t>
         An administrator needs to restrict write access to all
         configurable objects within this data model.
       </t>
       <t>
         If write access is allowed for configuration of
         access control rules, then care needs to be taken
         not to disrupt the access control enforcement.
         For example, if the NACM access control rules are edited directly
         within the running configuration datastore (i.e.,
         :writable-running capability is supported and used),
         then care needs to be taken not to allow unintended
         access while the edits are being done.
       </t>
       <t>
         An administrator needs to make sure that
         the translation from a transport- or implementation-dependent
         user identity to a NACM username is unique
         and correct.  This requirement is specified in detail in
         Section&nbsp;2.2 of <xref target="RFC6241"/>.
       </t>
       <t>
         An administrator needs to be aware that the YANG data structures
         representing access control rules (/nacm/rule-list
         and /nacm&wj;/rule&nbhy;list/rule)
         are ordered by the client.  The server will evaluate the
         access control rules according to their relative conceptual order
         within the running configuration datastore.
       </t>
       <t>
         Note that the /nacm/groups data structure contains
         the administrative group names used by the server.
         These group names may be configured locally and/or
         provided through an external protocol, such as RADIUS
         <xref target="RFC2865"/> <xref target="RFC5607"/>.
       </t>
       <t>
         An administrator needs to be aware of the security properties
         of any external protocol used by the transport layer
         to determine group names.  For example, if this protocol does
         not protect against man&nbhy;in-the-middle attacks, an attacker
         might be able to inject group names that are configured in
         the NACM so that a user gets more permissions than it should.
         In such cases, the administrator may wish to disable the
         usage of such group names by setting
         /nacm&wj;/enable-external-groups to "false".
       </t>

       <t>
       Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
       sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
       important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
       notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
       nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
       </t>

         <t><list style="symbols">
           <t>/nacm/enable-nacm</t>
           <t>/nacm/read-default</t>
           <t>/nacm/write-default</t>
           <t>/nacm/exec-default</t>
           <t>/nacm/enable-external-groups</t>
           <t>/nacm/groups</t>
           <t>/nacm/rule-list</t>
         </list></t>

       <t>
         An administrator needs to restrict read access to the
         above-listed objects within this data model, as they reveal
         access control configuration that could be considered
         sensitive.</t>

     </section>

     <section title="General Configuration Issues">
       <t>
         There is a risk that invocation of
         non-standard protocol operations will have undocumented side effects.
         An administrator needs to construct access control rules
         such that the configuration datastore is protected
         from such side effects.
       </t>
       <t>
         It is possible for a session with some write access
         (e.g., allowed to invoke &lt;edit-config&gt;),
         but without any access to a particular datastore subtree
         containing sensitive data, to determine the presence
         or non-presence of that data.
         This can be done by repeatedly issuing
         some sort of edit request (create, update, or delete)
         and possibly receiving "access&nbhy;denied" errors in response.
         These "fishing" attacks can identify the presence or
         non-presence of specific sensitive data even without
         the "error-path" field being present within the &lt;rpc-error&gt;
         response.
       </t>
       <t>
         It may be possible for the set of NETCONF capabilities
         on the server to change over time.  If so, then there is a risk
         that new protocol operations, notifications, and/or
         datastore content have been added to the device.
         An administrator needs to be sure that the access control
         rules are correct for the new content in this case.
         Mechanisms to detect NETCONF capability changes on
         a specific device are outside the scope of this document.
       </t>
       <t>
         It is possible that the data model definition itself
         (e.g., a YANG when&nbhy;stmt) will help an unauthorized session
         determine the presence or even value of sensitive data nodes
         by examining the presence and values of different data nodes.
       </t>
        <t>
         It is possible that the data model definition itself (e.g., a
         YANG when&nbhy;stmt or choice&nbhy;stmt) will allow a session to
         implicitly create or delete nodes that the session does not
         have write access to as an implicit side effect from the
         processing of an allowed &lt;edit-config&gt; operation.
       </t>
       <t>
         There is a risk that non-standard protocol operations, or
         even the standard &lt;get&gt; protocol operation, may
         return data that "aliases" or "copies" sensitive data
         from a different data object.  There may simply be
         multiple data model definitions that expose
         or even configure the same underlying system
         instrumentation.
       </t>
       <t>
         A data model may contain external keys (e.g., YANG leafref),
         which expose values from a different data structure.
         An administrator needs to be aware of sensitive data models
         that contain leafref nodes.  This entails finding all the
         leafref objects that "point" at the sensitive data (i.e.,
         "path-stmt" values) that implicitly or explicitly includes
         the sensitive data node.
       </t>
       <t>
         It is beyond the scope of this document to define access
         control enforcement
         procedures for underlying device instrumentation that may
         exist to support the NETCONF server operation.  An administrator
         can identify each protocol operation that the server provides
         and decide if it needs any access control applied to it.
       </t>
       <t>
         This document incorporates the optional use of a recovery session
         mechanism, which can be used to bypass access control
         enforcement in emergencies such as NACM configuration errors
         that disable all access to the server.
         The configuration and identification of such
         a recovery session mechanism are implementation specific
         and are outside the scope of this document.
         An administrator needs to be aware of any recovery session
         mechanisms available on the device and make sure that they
         are used appropriately.
       </t>
       <t>
         It is possible for a session to disrupt configuration
         management, even without any write access to the configuration,
         by locking the datastore. This may be done to ensure that all or
         part of the configuration remains stable while it is being
         retrieved, or it may be done as a "denial-of-service" attack.
         There is no way for the server to know the difference.
         An administrator may wish to
         restrict "exec" access to the following protocol operations:
         <list style="symbols">
           <t>&lt;lock&gt;</t>
           <t>&lt;unlock&gt;</t>
           <t>&lt;partial-lock&gt;</t>
           <t>&lt;partial-unlock&gt;</t>
         </list>
       </t>
     </section>
     <section title="Data Model Design Considerations">
       <t>
         Designers need to clearly identify any sensitive data,
         notifications, or protocol operations defined within a YANG
         module.  For such definitions, a "nacm:default-deny-write" or
         "nacm:default-deny-all" statement ought to be present, in
         addition to a clear description of the security risks.
       </t>
       <t>
         Protocol operations need to be properly documented by the
         data model designer so that it is clear to administrators what
         data nodes (if any) are affected by the protocol operation
         and what information (if any) is returned in the
         &lt;rpc-reply&gt; message.
       </t>
       <t>
         Data models ought to be designed so that different access
         levels for input parameters to protocol operations are not required.
         The use of generic protocol operations should be avoided, and
         if different access levels are needed, separate
         protocol operations should be defined instead.
