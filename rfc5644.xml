    <section title="Introduction and Scope">
      <t>IETF has standardized IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) for measuring
      end-to-end performance between two points. This memo defines two new
      categories of metrics that extend the coverage to multiple measurement
      points. It defines spatial metrics for measuring the performance of
      segments of a source to destination path, and metrics for measuring the
      performance between a source and many destinations in multiparty
      communications (e.g., a multicast tree).</t>

      <t>The purpose of this memo is to define metrics to fulfill the new
      requirements of measurement involving multiple measurement points.
      Spatial metrics measure the performance of each segment along a path.
      One-to-group metrics measure the performance for a group of users. These
      metrics are derived from one-way end-to-end metrics, all of which follow
      the IPPM framework <xref target="RFC2330"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This memo is organized as follows: <xref target="terms"></xref>
      introduces new terms that extend the original IPPM framework <xref
      target="RFC2330"></xref>. <xref target="brief_desc"></xref> briefly
      introduces the new metrics, and <xref target="motivations"></xref>
      motivates each metric category. Sections <xref format="counter"
      target="spatial_vector_desc"></xref> through <xref format="counter"
      target="o2gsample"></xref> develop each category of metrics with
      definitions and statistics. Then the memo discusses the impact of the
      measurement methods on the scalability and proposes an information model
      for reporting the measurements. Finally, the memo discusses security
      aspects related to measurement and registers the metrics in the IANA IP
      Performance Metrics Registry <xref target="RFC4148"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The scope of this memo is limited to metrics using a single source
      packet or stream, and observations of corresponding packets along the
      path (spatial), at one or more destinations (one-to-group), or both.
      Note that all the metrics defined herein are based on observations of
      packets dedicated to testing, a process that is called active
      measurement. Passive measurement (for example, a spatial metric based on
      the observation of user traffic) is beyond the scope of this memo.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref

      <section title="Naming of the Metrics">
        <t>The names of the metrics, including capitalized letters, are as
        close as possible of the names of the one-way end-to-end metrics they
        are derived from.</t>

      <section title="Routers Digest">
        <t>The list of the routers on the path from the source to the
        destination that act as points of interest, also referred to as the
        routers digest.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Multiparty Metric">
        <t>A metric is said to be multiparty if the topology involves more
        than one measurement collection point. All multiparty metrics
        designate a set of hosts as "points of interest", where one host is
        the source and other hosts are the measurement collection points. For
        example, if the set of points of interest is &lt; ha, hb, hc, ..., hn
        &gt;, where ha is the source and &lt; hb, hc, ..., hn &gt; are the
        destinations, then measurements may be conducted between &lt; ha,
        hb&gt;, &lt; ha, hc&gt;, ..., &lt;ha, hn &gt;.</t>

        <t>For the purposes of this memo (reflecting the scope of a single
        source), the only multiparty metrics are one-to-group metrics.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Spatial Metric">
        <t>A metric is said to be spatial if one of the hosts (measurement
        collection points) involved is neither the source nor a destination of
        the measured packet(s). Such measurement hosts will usually be routers
        that are members of the routers digest.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="One-to-Group Metric">
        <t>A metric is said to be one-to-group if the measured packet is sent
        by one source and (potentially) received by more than one destination.
        Thus, the topology of the communication group can be viewed as a
        center-distributed or server-client topology with the source as the
        center/server in the topology.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Points of Interest">
        <t>Points of interest are the hosts (as per the RFC 2330 definition,
        "hosts" include routing nodes) that are measurement collection points,
        which are a sub-set of the set of hosts involved in the delivery of
        the packets (in addition to the source itself).</t>

        <t>For spatial metrics, points of interest are a (possibly arbitrary)
        sub-set of all the routers involved in the path.</t>

        <t>Points of interest of one-to-group metrics are the intended
        destination hosts for packets from the source (in addition to the
        source itself).</t>

      <section title="Reference Point">
        <t>A reference point is defined as the server where the statistical
        calculations will be carried out. It is usually a centralized server
        in the measurement architecture that is controlled by a network
        operator, where measurement data can be collected for further
        processing. The reference point is distinctly different from hosts at
        measurement collection points, where the actual measurements are
        carried out (e.g., points of interest).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Vector ">
        <t>A vector is a set of singletons (single atomic results) comprised
        of observations corresponding to a single source packet at different
        hosts in a network. For instance, if the one-way delay singletons
        observed at N receivers for Packet P sent by the source Src are dT1,
        dT2,..., dTN, then a vector V with N elements can be organized as
        {dT1, dT2,&hellip;, dTN}. The element dT1 is distinct from all others
        as the singleton at receiver 1 in response to a packet sent from the
        source at a specific time. The complete vector gives information over
        the dimension of space, a set of N receivers in this example.</t>

        <t>The singleton elements of any vector are distinctly different from
        each other in terms of their measurement collection point. Different
        vectors for common measurement points of interest are distinguished by
        the source packet sending time.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Matrix">
        <t>Several vectors form a matrix, which contains results observed over
        a sampling interval at different places in a network at different
        times. For example, the one-way delay vectors V1={dT11, dT12,...,
        dT1N}, V2={dT21, dT22,&hellip;, dT2N},&hellip;, Vm={dTm1,
        dTm2,&hellip;, dTmN} for Packet P1, P2,&hellip;,Pm, form a one-way
        delay Matrix {V1, V2,&hellip;,Vm}. The matrix organizes the vector
        information to present network performance in both space and time.</t>

        <t>A one-dimensional matrix (row) corresponds to a sample in simple
        point-to-point measurement.</t>

        <t>The relationship among singleton, sample, vector, and matrix is
        illustrated in <xref target="Figmatrix"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="brief_desc" title="Brief Metric Descriptions">
      <t>The metrics for spatial and one-to-group measurement are based on the
      source-to-destination, or end-to-end metrics defined by IETF in <xref
      target="RFC2679"></xref>, <xref target="RFC2680"></xref>, <xref
      target="RFC3393"></xref>, and <xref target="RFC3432"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This memo defines seven new spatial metrics using the <xref
      target="RFC2330"></xref> framework of parameters, units of measure, and
      measurement methodologies. Each definition includes a section that
      describes measurement constraints and issues, and provides guidance to
      increase the accuracy of the results.</t>

      <t>The spatial metrics are:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Type-P-Spatial-One-way-Delay-Vector divides the end-to-end
          Type-P-One-way-Delay <xref target="RFC2679"></xref> into a spatial
          vector of one-way delay singletons.</t>

          <t>Type-P-Spatial-One-way-Packet-Loss-Vector divides an end-to-end
          Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss <xref target="RFC2680"></xref> into a
          spatial vector of packet loss singletons.</t>

          <t>Type-P-Spatial-One-way-ipdv-Vector divides an end-to-end
          Type-P-One-way-ipdv into a spatial vector of ipdv (IP Packet Delay
          Variation) singletons.</t>

          <t>Using elements of the Type-P-Spatial-One-way-Delay-Vector metric,
          a sample called Type-P-Segment-One-way-Delay-Stream collects one-way
          delay metrics between two points of interest on the path over
          time.</t>

          <t>Likewise, using elements of the Type-P-Spatial-Packet-Loss-Vector
          metric, a sample called Type-P-Segment-Packet-Loss-Stream collects
          one-way delay metrics between two points of interest on the path
          over time.</t>

          <t>Using the Type-P-Spatial-One-way-Delay-Vector metric, a sample
          called Type-P-Segment-ipdv-prev-Stream will be introduced to compute
          ipdv metrics (using the previous packet selection function) between
          two points of interest on the path over time.</t>

          <t>Again using the Type-P-Spatial-One-way-Delay-Vector metric, a
          sample called Type-P-Segment-ipdv-min-Stream will define another set
          of ipdv metrics (using the minimum delay packet selection function)
          between two points of interest on the path over time.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The memo also defines three one-to-group metrics to measure the
      one-way performance between a source and a group of receivers. They are:
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>Type-P-One-to-group-Delay-Vector which collects the set of
          Type-P-One-way-Delay singletons between one sender and N
          receivers;</t>

          <t>Type-P-One-to-group-Packet-Loss-Vector which collects the set of
          Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss singletons between one sender and N
          receivers; and</t>

          <t>Type-P-One-to-group-ipdv-Vector which collects the set of
          Type-P-One-way-ipdv singletons between one sender and N
          receivers.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Finally, based on the one-to-group vector metrics listed above,
      statistics are defined to capture single receiver performance, group
      performance, and the relative performance for a multiparty
      communication:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Using the Type-P-One-to-group-Delay-Vector, a metric called
          Type-P-One-to-group-Receiver-n-Mean-Delay, or RnMD, presents the
          mean of delays between one sender and a single receiver 'n'. From
          this metric, three additional metrics are defined to characterize
          the mean delay over the entire group of receivers during the same
          time interval:<list>
              <t>Type-P-One-to-group-Mean-Delay, or GMD, presents the mean of
              delays;</t>

              <t>Type-P-One-to-group-Range-Mean-Delay, or GRMD, presents the
              range of mean delays; and</t>

              <t>Type-P-One-to-group-Max-Mean-Delay, or GMMD, presents the
              maximum of mean delays.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Using the Type-P-One-to-group-Packet-Loss-Vector, a metric called
          Type-P-One-to-group-Receiver-n-Loss-Ratio, or RnLR, captures the
          packet loss ratio between one sender and a single receiver 'n'.
          Based on this definition, two more metrics are defined to
          characterize packet loss over the entire group during the same time
          interval:<list>
              <t>Type-P-One-to-group-Loss-Ratio, or GLR, captures the overall
              packet loss ratio for the entire group of receivers; and</t>

              <t>Type-P-One-to-group-Range-Loss-Ratio, or GRLR, presents the
              comparative packet loss ratio during the test interval between
              one sender and N receivers.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Using the Type-P-One-to-group-Packet-Loss-Vector, a metric called
          Type-P-One-to-group-Receiver-n-Comp-Loss-Ratio, or RnCLR, computes a
          packet loss ratio using the maximum number of packets received at
          any receiver.</t>

          <t>Using Type-P-One-to-group-ipdv-Vector, a metric called
          Type-P-One-to-group-Range-Delay-Variation, or GRDV, presents the
          range of delay variation between one sender and a group of
          receivers.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="motivations" title="Motivations">
      <t>All existing IPPM metrics are defined for end-to-end
      (source-to-destination) measurement of point-to-point paths. It is

      <section title="Motivations for One-to-group Metrics">
        <t>While the node-to-node-based spatial measures can provide very
        useful data in the view of each connection, we also need measures to
        present the performance of a multiparty communication topology. A
        simple point-to-point metric cannot completely describe the multiparty
        situation. New one-to-group metrics assess performance of the multiple
        paths for further statistical analysis. The new metrics are named
        one-to-group performance metrics, and they are based on the unicast
        metrics defined in IPPM RFCs. One-to-group metrics are one-way metrics
        from one source to a group of destinations or receivers. The metrics
        are helpful for judging the overall performance of a multiparty
        communications network and for describing the performance variation
        across a group of destinations.</t>

        <t>One-to-group performance metrics are needed for:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Designing and engineering multicast trees and MPLS
            point-to-multipoint Label Switched Paths (LSPs).</t>

            <t>Evaluating and controlling the quality of multicast services,
            including inter-domain multicast.</t>

            <t>Presenting and evaluating the performance requirements for
            multiparty communications and overlay multicast.</t>
          </list>To understand the packet transfer performance between one
        source and any one receiver in the multiparty communication group, we
        need to collect instantaneous end-to-end metrics, or singletons. This
        gives a very detailed view into the performance of each branch of the
        multicast tree, and can provide clear and helpful information for
        engineers to identify the branch with problems in a complex multiparty
        routing tree.</t>

        <t>The one-to-group metrics described in this memo introduce the
        multiparty topology into the IPPM framework, and they describe the
        performance delivered to a group receiving packets from the same
        source. The concept extends the "path" of the point-to-point
        measurement to "path tree" to cover one-to-many topologies. If applied
        to one-to-one topology, the one-to-group metrics provide exactly the
        same results as the corresponding one-to-one metrics.</t>

      <section title="Discussion on Group-to-One and Group-to-Group Metrics">
        <t>We note that points of interest can also be selected to define
        measurements on group-to-one and group-to-group topologies. These
        topologies are beyond the scope of this memo, because they would
        involve multiple packets launched from different sources. However,
        this section gives some insights on these two cases.</t>

        <t>The measurements for group-to-one topology can be easily derived
        from the one-to-group measurement. The measurement point is the host
        that is acting as a receiver while all other hosts act as sources in
        this case.</t>

        <t>The group-to-group communication topology has no obvious focal
        point: the sources and the measurement collection points can be
        anywhere. However, it is possible to organize the problem by applying
        measurements in one-to-group or group-to-one topologies for each host
        in a uniform way (without taking account of how the real communication
        might be carried out). For example, one group of hosts &lt; ha, hb,
        hc, ..., hn &gt; might act as sources to send data to another group of
        hosts &lt; Ha, Hb, Hc, ..., Hm &gt;, and they can be organized into n
        sets of points of interest for one-to-group communications:</t>

        <t>&lt; ha, Ha, Hb, Hc, ..., Hm &gt;, &lt; hb, Ha, Hb, Hc, ..., Hm

        <section title="Packet Loss Detection">
          <t>In a pure end-to-end measurement, packet losses are detected by
          the receiver only. A packet is lost when Type-P-One-way-Delay is
          undefined or very large (see sections 2.4 and 2.5 of <xref
          target="RFC2680"></xref> and section 3.5 of <xref
          target="RFC2680"></xref>). A packet is deemed lost by the receiver
          after a duration that starts at the time the packet is sent. This
          timeout value is chosen by a measurement process. It determines the
          threshold between recording a long packet transfer time as a finite
          value or an undefined value.</t>

          <t>In a spatial measurement, packet losses may be detected at
          several measurement collection points. Depending on the consistency
          of the packet loss detections among the points of interest, a packet
          may be considered as lost at one point despite having a finite delay
          at another, or it may be observed by the last measurement collection
          point of the path but considered lost by Dst.</t>

          <t>There is a risk of misinterpreting such results: has the path
          changed? Did the packet arrive at the destination or was it lost on
          the very last link?</t>

          <t>The same concern applies to one-way delay measures: a delay
          measured may be computed as infinite by one observation point but as
          a real value by another one, or may be measured as a real value by
          the last observation point of the path but designated as undefined
          by Dst.</t>

          <t>The observation/measurement collection points and the destination
          SHOULD use consistent methods to detect packets losses. The methods
          and parameters must be systematically reported to permit careful
          comparison and to avoid introducing any confounding factors in the
          analysis.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Routers Digest ">
          <t>The methodology given above relies on knowing the order of the
          router/measurement collection points on the path <xref
          target="RFC2330"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Path instability might cause a test packet to be observed more
          than once by the same router, resulting in the repetition of one or
          more routers in the routers digest.</t>

          <t>For example, repeated observations may occur during rerouting
          phases that introduce temporary micro loops. During such an event,
          the routers digest for a packet crossing Ha and Hb may include the
          pattern &lt;Hb, Ha, Hb, Ha, Hb&gt;, meaning that Ha ended the
          computation of the new path before Hb and that the initial path was
          from Ha to Hb, and that the new path is from Hb to Ha.</t>

          <t>Consequently, duplication of routers in the routers digest of a
          vector MUST be identified before computation of statistics to avoid
          producing corrupted information.</t>

          <t>This metric belongs to the family of packet delay variation
          metrics (PDV). PDV distributions have less sensitivity to
          inter-packet interval variations than IPDV values, as discussed
          above.</t>

          <t>In principle, the PDV distribution reflects the variation over
          many different inter-packet intervals, from the smallest
          inter-packet interval, up to the length of the evaluation interval,
          Tm - T1. Therefore, when delay variation occurs and disturbs the
          packet spacing observed at Ha, the PDV results will likely compare
          favorably to a PDV measurement where the source is Ha and the
          destination is Hb, because a wide range of spacings are reflected in
          any PDV distribution.</t>

      <t></t>

      <t>The one-to-group metrics defined above are directly achieved by
      collecting relevant unicast one-way metrics measurements results and by
      gathering them per group of receivers. They produce network performance
      information that guides engineers toward potential problems that may
      have happened on any branch of a multicast routing tree.</t>

      <t>The results of these metrics are not directly usable to present the
      performance of a group because each result is made of a huge number of
      singletons that are difficult to read and analyze. As an example, delays
      are not comparable because the distance between receiver and sender
      differs. Furthermore, they don't capture relative performance situations
      in a multiparty communication.</t>

      <t>From the performance point of view, the multiparty communication
      services not only require the support of absolute performance
      information but also information on "relative performance". "Relative
      performance" means the difference between absolute performance of all
      users. Directly using the one-way metrics cannot present the relative
      performance situation. However, if we use the variations of all users'
      one-way parameters, we can have new metrics to measure the difference of
      the absolute performance and hence provide the threshold value of
      relative performance that a multiparty service might demand. A very good
      example of the high relative performance requirement is online gaming. A
      very small difference in delay might result in failure in the game. We
      have to use multicast-specific statistic metrics to define the relative
      delay required by online gaming. There are many other services, e.g.,
      online biding, online stock market, etc., that require multicast metrics
      in order to evaluate the network against their requirements. Therefore,
      we can see the importance of new, multicast specific, statistic metrics
      to feed this need.</t>

      <t>We might also use some one-to-group statistic conceptions to present
      and report the group performance and relative performance to save the
      report transmission bandwidth. Statistics have been defined for One- way
      metrics in corresponding RFCs. They provide the foundation of definition
      for performance statistics. For instance, there are definitions for
      minimum and maximum one-way delay in <xref target="RFC2679"></xref>.
      However, there is a dramatic difference between the statistics for
      one-to-one communications and for one-to-many communications. The former
      one only has statistics over the time dimension while the later one can
      have statistics over both time and space dimensions. This space
      dimension is introduced by the Matrix concept as illustrated in <xref
      target="FigMatrixConcept"></xref>. For a Matrix M, each row is a set of
      one-way singletons spreading over the time dimension and each column is
      another set of One-way singletons spreading over the space
      dimension.</t>

      <t>In Matrix M, each element is a one-way delay singleton. Each column
      is a delay vector. It contains the one-way delays of the same packet
      observed at n points of interest. It implies the geographical factor of
      the performance within a group. Each row is a set of one-way delays
      observed during a sampling interval at one of the points of interest. It
      presents the delay performance at a receiver over the time
      dimension.</t>

      <t>Therefore, one can either calculate statistics by rows over the space
      dimension or by columns over the time dimension. It's up to the
      operators or service providers in which dimension they are interested.
      For example, a TV broadcast service provider might want to know the
      statistical performance of each user in a long-term run to make sure
      their services are acceptable and stable. While for an online gaming
      service provider, he might be more interested in knowing if all users
      are served fairly by calculating the statistics over the space
      dimension. This memo does not intend to recommend which of the
      statistics are better than the others.</t>

      <t>To save the report transmission bandwidth, each point of interest can
      send statistics in a pre-defined time interval to the reference point
      rather than sending every one-way singleton it observed. As long as an
      appropriate time interval is decided, appropriate statistics can
      represent the performance in a certain accurate scale. How to decide the
      time interval and how to bootstrap all points of interest and the
      reference point depend on applications. For instance, applications with
      a lower transmission rate can have the time interval be longer, and ones
      with higher transmission rate can have the time interval be shorter.
      However, this is out of the scope of this memo.</t>

      <t>Moreover, after knowing the statistics over the time dimension, one
      might want to know how these statistics are distributed over the space
      dimension. For instance, a TV broadcast service provider had the
      performance Matrix M and calculated the one-way delay mean over the time
      dimension to obtain a delay Vector as {V1,V2,..., VN}. He then
      calculated the mean of all the elements in the Vector to see what level
      of delay he has served to all N users. This new delay mean gives
      information on how well the service has been delivered to a group of
      users during a sampling interval in terms of delay. It requires twice as
      much calculation to have this statistic over both time and space
      dimensions. These kinds of statistics are referred to as 2-level
      statistics to distinguish them from 1-level statistics calculated over
      either space or time dimension. It can be easily proven that no matter
      over which dimension a 2-level statistic is calculated first, the
      results are the same. That is, one can calculate the 2-level delay mean
      using the Matrix M by having the 1-level delay mean over the time
      dimension first and then calculate the mean of the obtained vector to
      find out the 2-level delay mean. Or, he can do the 1-level statistic
      calculation over the space dimension first and then have the 2-level
      delay mean. Both results will be exactly the same. Therefore, when
      defining a 2-level statistic, there is no need to specify the order in
      which the calculation is executed.</t>

      <t>Many statistics can be defined for the proposed one-to-group metrics
      over the space dimension, the time dimension, or both. This memo treats
      the case where a stream of packets from the Source results in a sample
      at each of the Receivers in the Group, and these samples are each
      summarized with the usual statistics employed in one-to-one
      communication. New statistic definitions are presented, which summarize
      the one-to-one statistics over all the Receivers in the Group.</t>

      <section title="Discussion on the Impact of Packet Loss on Statistics">
        <t>Packet loss does have effects on one-way metrics and their
        statistics. For example, a lost packet can result in an infinite
        one-way delay. It is easy to handle the problem by simply ignoring the
        infinite value in the metrics and in the calculation of the
        corresponding statistics. However, the packet loss has such a strong
        impact on the statistics calculation for the one-to-group metrics that
        it can not be solved by the same method used for one-way metrics. This
        is due to the complexity of building a matrix, which is needed for
        calculation of the statistics proposed in this memo.</t>

        <t>The situation is that measurement results obtained by different end
        users might have different packet loss pattern. For example, for
        User1, packet A was observed to be lost. And for User2, packet A was
        successfully received, but packet B was lost. If the method to
        overcome the packet loss for one-way metrics is applied, the two
        singleton sets reported by User1 and User2 will be different in terms
        of the transmitted packets. Moreover, if User1 and User2 have a
        different number of lost packets, the size of the results will be
        different. Therefore, for the centralized calculation, the reference
        point will not be able to use these two results to build up the group
        Matrix and cannot calculate the statistics. The extreme situation
        being the case when no packets arrive at any user. One of the possible
        solutions is to replace the infinite/undefined delay value by the
        average of the two adjacent values. For example, if the result
        reported by User1 is { R1dT1 R1dT2 R1dT3 &hellip; R1dTK-1 UNDEF
        R1dTK+1&hellip; R1MD } where &ldquo;UNDEF&rdquo; is an undefined
        value, the reference point can replace it by R1dTK = {(R1dTK-1)+(
        R1dTK+1)}/2. Therefore, this result can be used to build up the group
        Matrix with an estimated value R1dTK. There are other possible
        solutions, such as using the overall mean of the whole result to
        replace the infinite/undefined value, and so on. However, this is out
        of the scope of this memo.</t>

        <t>For the distributed calculation, the reported statistics might have
        different &ldquo;weight&rdquo; to present the group performance, which
        is especially true for delay and ipdv relevant metrics. For example,
        User1 calculates the Type-P-Finite-One-way-Delay-Mean R1MD as shown in
        Figure 7 without any packet loss, and User2 calculates the R2MD with
        N-2 packet loss. The R1MD and R2MD should not be treated with equal
        weight because R2MD was calculated only based on two delay values in
        the whole sample interval. One possible solution is to use a weight
        factor to mark every statistic value sent by users and use this factor
        for further statistic calculation.</t>

    <section title="Measurement Methods: Scalability and Reporting">
      <t>Virtually all the guidance on measurement processes supplied by the
      earlier IPPM RFCs (such as <xref target="RFC2679"></xref> and <xref
      target="RFC2680"></xref>) for one-to-one scenarios is applicable here in
      the spatial and multiparty measurement scenario. The main difference is
      that the spatial and multiparty configurations require multiple points
      of interest where a stream of singletons will be collected. The amount
      of information requiring storage grows with both the number of metrics
      and the points of interest, so the scale of the measurement architecture
      multiplies the number of singleton results that must be collected and
      processed.</t>

      <t>It is possible that the architecture for results collection involves
      a single reference point with connectivity to all the points of
      interest. In this case, the number of points of interest determines both
      storage capacity and packet transfer capacity of the host acting as the
      reference point. However, both the storage and transfer capacity can be
      reduced if the points of interest are capable of computing the summary
      statistics that describe each measurement interval. This is consistent
      with many operational monitoring architectures today, where even the
      individual singletons may not be stored at each point of interest.</t>

      <t>In recognition of the likely need to minimize the form of the results
      for storage and communication, the Group metrics above have been
      constructed to allow some computations on a per-Receiver basis. This
      means that each Receiver's statistics would normally have an equal
      weight with all other Receivers in the Group (regardless of the number
      of packets received).</t>

      <section title="Computation Methods">
        <t></t>

        <t>The scalability issue can be raised when there are thousands of
        points of interest in a group who are trying to send back the
        measurement results to the reference point for further processing and
        analysis. The points of interest can send either the whole measured
        sample or only the calculated statistics. The former is a centralized
        statistic calculation method and the latter is a distributed statistic
        calculation method. The sample should include all metrics parameters,
        the values, and the corresponding sequence numbers. The transmission
        of the whole sample can cost much more bandwidth than the transmission
        of the statistics that should include all statistic parameters
        specified by policies and the additional information about the whole
        sample, such as the size of the sample, the group address, the address
        of the point of interest, the ID of the sample session, and so on.
        Apparently, the centralized calculation method can require much more
        bandwidth than the distributed calculation method when the sample size
        is big. This is especially true when the measurement has a very large
        number of the points of interest. It can lead to a scalability issue
        at the reference point by overloading the network resources.</t>

        <t>The distributed calculation method can save much more bandwidth and
        mitigate issues arising from scalability at the reference point
        side.</t>

        <t>However, it may result in a loss of information. As not all
        measured singletons are available for building up the group matrix,
        the real performance over time can be hidden from the result. For
        example, the loss pattern can be missed by simply accepting the loss
        ratio. This tradeoff between bandwidth consumption and information
        acquisition has to be taken into account when designing the
        measurement approach.</t>

        <t>One possible solution could be to transmit the statistic parameters
        to the reference point first to obtain the general information of the
        group performance. If detailed results are required, the reference
        point should send the requests to the points of interest, which could
        be particular ones or the whole group. This procedure can happen in
        the off peak time and can be well scheduled to avoid delivery of too
        many points of interest at the same time. Compression techniques can
        also be used to minimize the bandwidth required by the transmission.
        This could be a measurement protocol to report the measurement
        results. However, this is out of the scope of this memo.</t>

      <section title="Measurement">
        <t>To prevent any bias in the result, the configuration of a
        one-to-many measure must take into consideration that more packets
        will be routed than sent (copies of a packet sent are expected to
        arrive at many destination points) and select a test packet rate that
        will not impact the network performance.</t>

        <t>Two methods are available to compute statistics on a matrix: <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>Method 1: The statistic metric is computed over time and then
            over space; or</t>

            <t>Method 2: The statistic metric is computed over space and then
            over time.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>These two methods differ only by the order of the aggregation. The
        order does not impact the computation resources required. It does not
        change the value of the result. However, it impacts severely the
        minimal volume of data to report: <list style="symbols">
            <t>Method 1: Each point of interest periodically computes
            statistics over time to lower the volume of data to report. They
            are reported to the reference point for subsequent computations
            over the spatial dimension. This volume no longer depends on the
            number of samples. It is only proportional to the computation
            period.</t>

            <t>Method 2: The volume of data to report is proportional to the
            number of samples. Each sample, RiSi, must be reported to the
            reference point for computing statistic over space and statistic
            over time. The volume increases with the number of samples. It is
            proportional to the number of test packets;</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Method 2 has severe drawbacks in terms of security and
        dimensioning: <list style="symbols">
            <t>Increasing the rate of the test packets may result in a Denial
            of Service (DoS) toward the points of reference;</t>

            <t>The dimensioning of a measurement system is quite impossible to
            validate because any increase of the rate of the test packets will
            increase the bandwidth requested to collect the raw results.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The computation period over time period (commonly named the
        aggregation period) provides the reporting side with a control of
        various collecting aspects such as bandwidth, computation, and storage
        capacities. So this document defines metrics based on method 1.</t>

              <t>Method 1: Spatial segment metrics and statistics are

              <t>Method 2: Vectors metrics are intrinsically instantaneous

    <section title="Manageability Considerations">
      <t>This section defines the reporting of all the metrics introduced in
      the document.</t>

      <t>Information models of spatial metrics and of one-to-group metrics are
      similar except that points of interests of spatial vectors MUST be
      ordered.</t>

      <t>The complexity of the reporting relies on the number of points of
      interest.</t>

      <section title="Reporting Spatial Metric">
        <t>The reporting of spatial metrics shares a lot of aspects with RFC
        2679 and RFC 2680. New ones are common to all the definitions and are
        mostly related to the reporting of the path and of methodology
        parameters that may bias raw results analysis. This section presents
        these specific parameters and then lists exhaustively the parameters
        that SHOULD be reported.</t>

        <section title="Path">
          <t>End-to-end metrics can't determine the path of the measure
          despite the fact that IPPM RFCs recommend it be reported (see
          section 3.8.4 of <xref target="RFC2679"></xref>). Spatial metrics
          vectors provide this path. The report of a spatial vector MUST
          include the points of interests involved: the sub-set of the routers
          of the path participating to the instantaneous measure.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Host Order">
          <t>A spatial vector MUST order the points of interest according to
          their order in the path. The ordering MAY be based on information
          from the TTL in IPv4, the Hop Limit in IPv6, or the corresponding
          information in MPLS.</t>

          <t>The report of a spatial vector MUST include the ordered list of
          the hosts involved in the instantaneous measure.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Timestamping Bias">
          <t>The location of the point of interest inside a node influences
          the timestamping skew and accuracy. As an example, consider that
          some internal machinery delays the timestamping up to three
          milliseconds; then the minimal uncertainty reported be 3 ms if the
          internal delay is unknown at the time of the timestamping.</t>

          <t>The report of a spatial vector MUST include the uncertainty of
          the timestamping compared to wire-time.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Reporting Spatial One-Way Delay">
          <t>The reporting includes information to report for one-way delay as
          section 3.6 of <xref target="RFC2679"></xref>. The same applies for
          packet loss and ipdv.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Reporting One-to-Group Metric">
        <t>All reporting rules described in <xref target="RFC2679"></xref> and
        <xref target="RFC2680"></xref> apply to the corresponding One-to-group
        metrics. The following are specific parameters that SHOULD be
        reported.</t>

        <section title="Path">
          <t>As suggested by <xref target="RFC2679"></xref> and <xref
          target="RFC2680"></xref>, the path traversed by the packet SHOULD be
          reported, if possible. For One-to-group metrics, the path tree
          between the source and the destinations or the set of paths between
          the source and each destination SHOULD be reported.</t>

          <t>The path tree might not be as valuable as individual paths
          because an incomplete path might be difficult to identify in the
          path tree. For example, how many points of interest are reached by a
          packet traveling along an incomplete path?</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Group Size">
          <t>The group size SHOULD be reported as one of the critical
          management parameters. One-to-group metrics, unlike spatial metrics,
          don't require the ordering of the points of interests because group
          members receive the packets in parallel.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Timestamping Bias">
          <t>It is the same as described in section 10.1.3.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Reporting One-to-group One-way Delay">
          <t>It is the same as described in section 10.1.4.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Measurement Method">
          <t>As explained in section 9, the measurement method will have
          impact on the analysis of the measurement result. Therefore, it
          SHOULD be reported.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Metric Identification">
        <t>IANA assigns each metric defined by the IPPM WG a unique identifier
        as per <xref target="RFC4148"></xref> in the
        IANA-IPPM-METRICS-REGISTRY-MIB.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Information Model">
        <t>This section presents the elements of information and the usage of
        the information reported for network performance analysis. It is out
        of the scope of this section to define how the information is
        reported.</t>

        <t>The information model is built with pieces of information

        <t>Malicious generation of packets that systematically match the hash
        function used to detect the packets may lead to a DoS attack toward

        <t>Spatial measurement results carry the performance of individual
        segments of the path and the identity of nodes. An attacker may infer
        from this information the points of weakness of a network (e.g.,
        congested node) that would require the least amount of additional
        attacking traffic to exploit. Therefore, monitoring information should
        be carried in a way that prevents unintended recipients from
        inspecting the measurement reports. A straightforward solution is to
        restrict access to the reports using encrypted sessions or secured
        networks.</t>

        <t>The configuration of a measurement must take into consideration
        that implicitly more packets will be routed than sent and select a
        test packet rate accordingly. Collecting statistics from a huge number

        measurement controller is attached, measurement controller network
        interfaces, and measurement controller computation capacities.</t>

        <t>One-to-group metric measurements should consider using source
        authentication protocols, standardized in the MSEC group, to avoid
