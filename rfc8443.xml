 This document extends the Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT) specification
 defined in RFC 8225 to allow the inclusion of cryptographically 
 signed assertions of authorization for the values populated in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) 'Resource-Priority' header field, which is used for 
 communications resource prioritization.

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>PASSporT <xref target ="RFC8225"/> is a token format based on JSON
Web Token (JWT) <xref target = "RFC7519"/> for conveying
cryptographically signed information about the identities involved in
personal communications. PASSporT with Secure Telephone Identity
Revisited (STIR) <xref target ="RFC8224"/> provides a mechanism by
which an authority on the originating side of a call, using a protocol
like SIP <xref target ="RFC3261"/>, can provide a cryptographic
assurance of the validity of the calling party telephone number in
order to prevent impersonation attacks. </t>




<t> <xref target ="RFC4412"/> defines a mechanism to prioritize access to SIP-signaled resources during periods of communications resource scarcity using the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header. As specified in
<xref target ="RFC4412"/>, the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field may
be used by SIP user agents (UAs) <xref target ="RFC3261"/> 
(including Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) gateways and SIP
proxy servers) to influence prioritization afforded to communication
sessions, including PSTN calls (e.g., to manage scarce network
resources during network congestion scenarios). However, the SIP
'Resource-Priority' header field could be spoofed and abused by
unauthorized entities, the threat models and use cases of which are
described in <xref target ="RFC7375"/> and <xref target ="RFC7340"/>,
respectively. Compromise of the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field
<xref target ="RFC4412"/> could lead to misuse of network resources
(i.e., during congestion scenarios), impacting the application
services supported using the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field.</t>

<t> <xref target ="RFC8225"/> allows extensions by which an authority
on the originating side verifying the authorization of a
particular communication for the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field can use a PASSPorT
claim to cryptographically sign the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field
and convey assertion of the authorization for the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field. A
signed SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field will allow a receiving
entity (including entities located in different network
domains/boundaries) to verify the validity of assertions authorizing
the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field and to act on the information with confidence that
the information has not been spoofed or compromised. </t>


<t> This specification documents an extension to PASSporT and the
associated STIR mechanisms to provide a function to cryptographically
sign the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field. This PASSporT object is
used to provide attestation of a calling-user authorization for
priority communications.  This is necessary in addition to the
PASSporT object that is used for calling-user telephone-number
attestation.  How this extension to PASSporT is used for real-time
communications supported using the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field
is outside the scope of this document.  In addition, the PASSPorT
extension defined in this document is intended for use in environments
where there are means to verify that the signer of the SIP
'Resource-Priority' header field is authoritative.</t>

<section anchor="passport_rph_claim" title="PASSporT &quot;rph&quot; Claim">

<t>This specification defines a new JSON Web Token claim for "rph" that
provides an assertion for information in the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field. </t>

<t>The creator of a PASSporT object adds a "ppt" value of "rph" to the header of a
 PASSporT object. The PASSporT claims MUST contain an "rph" claim, and any entities verifying the PASSporT object will be required to understand the "ppt" extension in order to process the PASSporT in question.  A PASSPorT header with the "ppt" included will look as follows: </t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
{  
"typ":"passport",
  "ppt":"rph",
  "alg":"ES256",
  "x5u":"https://www.example.org/cert.cer"
}
]]></artwork></figure>


<t>The "rph" claim will provide an assertion of authorization, "auth", for information in the  SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field 
   based on <xref target ="RFC4412"/>. The syntax is: </t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
{  
Resource-Priority = "Resource-Priority" : r-value,
r-value = namespace  "."  r-priority
}
]]></artwork></figure>
   
  <t> Specifically, the "rph" claim includes an assertion of the priority level of the user to be used for a given communication session. The value of the "rph" claim is an object 
   with one or more keys. Each key is associated with a JSON array. These arrays contain strings that correspond to the r-values indicated in the SIP 'Resource-Priority'
   header field.
  </t>

<t>The following is an example "rph" claim for a SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field with one r-value of "ets.0" and with another r-value of "wps.0": </t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
 { 
  "orig":{"tn":"12155550112"}, 
  "dest":{["tn":"12125550113"]},
  "iat":1443208345,
  "rph":{"auth":["ets.0", "wps.0"]}
 } 
]]></artwork></figure>

<t> After the header and claims PASSporT objects have been constructed, their signature is generated normally per the guidance in <xref target ="RFC8225"/>
    using the full form of PASSPorT. The credentials (i.e., Certificate) used to create the signature must have authority over the namespace of the "rph" claim, and there is only 
    one authority per claim. The authority MUST use its credentials associated with the specific service supported by the resource priority namespace 
    in the claim. If r-values are added or dropped by the intermediaries along
    the path, the intermediaries must generate a new "rph" header 
    and sign the claim with their own authority.  </t> 

<t> The use of the compact form of PASSporT is not specified in this document. </t>

</section>

<section anchor="rph_in_sip" title=" &quot;rph&quot; in SIP">

<t>This section specifies SIP-specific usage for the "rph" claim in PASSporT.  </t>


  <section anchor="Auth_service_behavior" title="Authentication Service Behavior">

<t>The Authentication Service will create the "rph" claim using the values
discussed in <xref target="passport_rph_claim" /> of this document that are based on <xref target ="RFC4412"/>. The construction 
 of the "rph" claim follows the steps described in Section 4.1 of <xref target ="RFC8224"/>. </t>

<t> The resulting Identity header for "rph" might look as follows (backslashes shown for line folding only):</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   Identity:eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInBwdCI6InJwaCIsInR5cCI6InBhc3Nwb3J0\

   org/cert.cer>;alg=ES256;ppt="rph"
]]></artwork></figure>



<t>  A SIP authentication service will derive the value of "rph" from the 
SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field based on policy associated with                                        
service-specific use of r-values, defined as follows in <xref target ="RFC4412"/>:
<list>
<t>r-value  = namespace "." r-priority</t>
</list>
The authentication service derives the value of the PASSPorT claim by verifying the
authorization for the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field (i.e.,
verifying a calling-user privilege for the SIP 'Resource-Priority'
header field based on its identity). The authorization might be
derived from customer-profile data or access to external
services. </t>

<t> <xref target = "RFC4412"/> allows multiple "namespace "." priority value" pairs, either in a single SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field or across multiple SIP 
   'Resource-Priority' header fields.  An authority is responsible for signing all the content of a SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field for which it has the authority. </t>

  </section>

  <section anchor="Verification_Service_Behavior" title="Verification Service Behavior">

<t><xref target ="RFC8224"/>, Section 6.2, Step 5 requires that specifications defining "ppt" values describe any additional verifier behavior. The 
   behavior specified for the "ppt" values of "rph" is as follows:  </t>

<t>The verification service MUST extract the value associated with the
"auth" key in a full-form PASSPorT with a "ppt" value of "rph". If the
signature validates, then the verification service can use the value
of the "rph" claim as validation that the calling party is authorized
for SIP 'Resource-Priority' header fields as indicated in the claim.  This value
would, in turn, be used for priority treatment in accordance with
local policy for the associated communication service. If the
signature validation fails, the verification service should infer that
the calling party is not authorized for SIP 'Resource-Priority' header fields as
indicated in the claim. In such cases, the priority treatment for the
associated communication service is handled as per the local policy of
the verifier.  In such scenarios, the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field
SHOULD be stripped from the SIP request, and the network entities
should treat the call as an ordinary call. </t>

<t> In addition, <xref target ="RFC8224"/>, Section 6.2, Step 4
requires the "iat" value in "rph" claim to be verified. </t>

<t> The behavior of a SIP UA upon receiving an INVITE containing a
PASSporT object with an "rph" claim will largely remain a matter of
implementation policy for the specific communication service. In most
cases, implementations would act based on confidence in the veracity
of this information. </t>



  </section>
</section>

<section anchor="Further_Information" title="Further Information Associated with the SIP &apos;Resource-Priority&apos; Header Field">

<t>There may be additional information about the calling party or the
call that could be relevant to authorization for the SIP
'Resource-Priority' header field. This may include information related
to the device subscription of the caller, to any institutions that
the caller or device is associated with, or even to categories of
institutions.  All of these data elements would benefit from the
secure attestations provided by the STIR and PASSporT frameworks.  The
specification of the "rph" claim could entail the optional presence of
one or more such additional information fields applicable to the SIP
'Resource-Priority' header field.</t>

<t> A new IANA registry has been defined to hold potential values of the "rph"
array; see <xref target="PASSporT_Types" />. The definition of the "rph" claim may have one or more such additional  
    information field(s).  Details of how an "rph" claim encompasses other data
elements are left for future specifications. </t>

 <section anchor="Solution-considerations" title="Solution Considerations">

<t> Using extensions to PASSporT tokens with a "ppt" value of "rph" requires knowledge of the authentication, authorization, and reputation of the signer to attest to the

    recognized when using PASSporT extensions with a "ppt" value of "rph":
</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t> A signer is only allowed to sign the content of a SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field for which it has the proper authorization.  Before signing tokens, the signer 
     MUST have a secure method for authentication of the end user or the device being granted a token. </t>
  <t>The verification of the signature MUST include means of verifying that the signer is authoritative for the signed content of the resource priority namespace in the 
   PASSporT. </t>
