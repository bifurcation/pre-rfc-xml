    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>

	This document describes extensions to the Intermediate System to
	Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol to support optimal routing
	within a two-level domain.  The IS-IS protocol is specified in
	<xref target="ISO-10589"/>, with extensions for supporting IPv4
	(Internet Protocol) specified in <xref target='RFC1195'/>.

      </t>
      <t>

	This document replaces <xref target='RFC2966'/>, which was an
	Informational document.  This document is on the standards track.
	No other intentional substantive changes have been made.

      </t>
      <t>

	This document extends the semantics presented in RFC 1195 so that a
	routing domain running with both level 1 and level 2 Intermediate
	Systems (IS) (routers) can distribute IP prefixes between level 1 and
	level 2, and vice versa.  This distribution requires certain
	restrictions to ensure that persistent forwarding loops do not form.
	The goal of this domain-wide prefix distribution is to increase the
	granularity of the routing information within the domain.

      </t>
      <t>

	An IS-IS routing domain (a.k.a. an autonomous system running IS-IS)
	can be partitioned into multiple level 1 (L1) areas, and a level 2
	(L2) connected subset of the topology that interconnects all of the
	L1 areas.  Within each L1 area, all routers exchange link state
	information.  L2 routers also exchange L2 link state information to
	compute routes between areas.

      </t>
      <t>

	RFC 1195 defines the Type, Length, and Value (TLV) tuples that are
	used to transport IPv4 routing information in IS-IS.  RFC 1195 also
	specifies the semantics and procedures for interactions between
	levels.  Specifically, routers in an L1 area will exchange information
	within the L1 area.  For IP destinations not found in the prefixes in
	the L1 database, the L1 router should forward packets to the nearest
	router that is in both L1 and L2 (i.e., an L1L2 router) with the
	"attached bit" set in its L1 Link State Protocol Data Unit (LSP).

      </t>
      <t>

	Also per RFC 1195, an L1L2 router should be manually configured with
	a set of prefixes that summarizes the IP prefixes reachable in that
	L1 area.  These summaries are injected into L2.  RFC 1195 specifies
	no further interactions between L1 and L2 for IPv4 prefixes.

      </t>
      <section title='Motivations for Domain-Wide Prefix Distribution'>
	<t>

	  The mechanisms specified in RFC 1195 are appropriate in many
	  situations and lead to excellent scalability properties.  However,
	  in certain circumstances, the domain administrator may wish to
	  sacrifice some amount of scalability and distribute more specific
	  information than is described by RFC 1195.  This section discusses
	  the various reasons why the domain administrator may wish to make
	  such a tradeoff.

	</t>
	<t>

	  One major reason for distributing more prefix information is to
	  improve the quality of the resulting routes.  A well-known property of
	  prefix summarization or any abstraction mechanism is that it
	  necessarily results in a loss of information.  This loss of
	  information in turn results in the computation of a route based upon
	  less information, which will frequently result in routes that are not
	  optimal.

	</t>
	<t>

	  A simple example can serve to demonstrate this adequately.  Suppose
	  that an L1 area has two L1L2 routers that both advertise a single
	  summary of all prefixes within the L1 area.  To reach a destination
	  inside the L1 area, any other L2 router is going to compute the
	  shortest path to one of the two L1L2 routers for that area.  Suppose,
	  for example, that both of the L1L2 routers are equidistant from the
	  L2 source and that the L2 source arbitrarily selects one L1L2
	  router.  This router may not be the optimal router when viewed from
	  the L1 topology.  In fact, it may be the case that the path from the
	  selected L1L2 router to the destination router may traverse the L1L2
	  router that was not selected.  If more detailed topological
	  information or more detailed metric information was available to the
	  L2 source router, it could make a more optimal route computation.

	</t>
	<t>

	  This situation is symmetric in that an L1 router has no information
	  about prefixes in L2 or within a different L1 area.  In using the
	  nearest L1L2 router, that L1L2 is effectively injecting a default
	  route without metric information into the L1 area.  The route
	  computation that the L1 router performs is similarly suboptimal.

	</t>
	<t>

	  Besides the optimality of the routes computed, there are two other
	  significant drivers for the domain-wide distribution of prefix
	  information.

	</t>
	<t>

	  When a router learns multiple possible paths to external destinations
	  via BGP, it will select only one of those routes to be installed in
	  the forwarding table.  One of the factors in the BGP route selection
	  is the IGP cost to the BGP next hop address.  Many ISP networks
	  depend on this technique, which is known as "shortest exit routing".
	  If a L1 router does not know the exact IGP metric to all BGP speakers
	  in other L1 areas, it cannot do effective shortest exit routing.

	</t>
	<t>

	  The third driver is the current practice of using the IGP (IS-IS)
	  metric as part of the BGP Multi-Exit Discriminator (MED).  The value
	  in the MED is advertised to other domains and is used to inform other
	  domains of the optimal entry point into the current domain.  Current
	  practice is to take the IS-IS metric and insert it as the MED value.
	  This tends to cause external traffic to enter the domain at the point
	  closest to the exit router.  Note that the receiving domain MAY,
	  based upon policy, choose to ignore the MED that is advertised.
	  However, current practice is to distribute the IGP metric in this way
	  in order to optimize routing wherever possible.  This is possible in
	  current networks that only are a single area, but becomes problematic
	  if hierarchy is to be installed into the network.  This is again
	  because the loss of end-to-end metric information means that the MED
	  value will not reflect the true distance across the advertising
	  domain.  Full distribution of prefix information within the domain
	  would alleviate this problem, as it would allow accurate computation
	  of the IS-IS metric across the domain, resulting in an accurate value
	  presented in the MED.

	</t>
      </section>
      <section title='Scalability'>
	<t>

	  The disadvantage to performing the domain-wide prefix distribution
	  described above is that it has an impact on the scalability of IS-IS.
	  Areas within IS-IS help scalability in that LSPs are contained within
	  a single area.  This limits the size of the link state database, which
	  in turn limits the complexity of the shortest path computation.

	</t>
	<t>

	  Further, the summarization of the prefix information aids scalability
	  in that the abstraction of the prefix information removes the sheer
	  number of data items to be transported and the number of routes to be
	  computed.

	</t>
	<t>

	  It should be noted quite strongly that the distribution of prefixes
	  on a domain-wide basis impacts the scalability of IS-IS in the second
	  respect.  It will increase the number of prefixes throughout the
	  domain.  This will result in increased memory consumption,
	  transmission requirements, and computation requirements throughout the
	  domain.

	</t>
	<t>

	  It must also be noted that the domain-wide distribution of prefixes
	  has no effect whatsoever on the first aspect of scalability, namely
	  the existence of areas and the limitation of the distribution of the
	  link state database.

	</t>
	<t>

	  Thus, the net result is that the introduction of domain-wide prefix
	  distribution into a formerly flat, single area network is a clear
	  benefit to the scalability of that network.  However, it is a
	  compromise and does not provide the maximum scalability available
	  with IS-IS.  Domains that choose to make use of this facility should
	  be aware of the tradeoff that they are making between scalability and
	  optimality, and provision and monitor their networks accordingly.
	  Normal provisioning guidelines that would apply to a fully
	  hierarchical deployment of IS-IS will not apply to this type of
	  configuration.

          "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

    <section title="Proposed Syntax and Semantics for L2->L1 Inter-Area
		    Routes">
      <t>

	This document defines the syntax of how to advertise level 2 routes
	in level 1 LSPs.  The encoding is an extension of the encoding in RFC
	1195.

      </t>
      <t>
	
	To some extent, in IS-IS the level 2 backbone can be seen as a
	separate area itself.  RFC 1195 defines that L1L2 routers can
	advertise IP routes that were learned via L1 routing into L2.  These
	routes can be regarded as inter-area routes.  RFC 1195 defines that
	these L1->L2 inter-area routes must be advertised in L2 LSPs in the
	"IP Internal Reachability Information" TLV (TLV 128).  Intra-area L2
	routes are also advertised in L2 LSPs in an "IP Internal Reachability
	Information" TLV.  Therefore, L1->L2 inter-area routes are
	indistinguishable from L2 intra-area routes.

      </t>
      <t>
	
	RFC 1195 does not define L2->L1 inter-area routes.  A simple
	extension would be to allow an L1L2 router to advertise routes
	learned via L2 routing in its L1 LSP. However, to prevent
        routing-loops, L1L2 routers MUST NOT
        advertise L2->L1 inter-area routes that they learn via L1
        routing back into L2. Therefore,
	there must be a way to distinguish L2->L1 inter-area routes from L1
	intra-area routes.  <xref target='RFC5305'/> defines the "up/down
	bit" for this purpose in the extended IP reachability TLV (TLV
	135).  RFC 1195 defines TLVs 128 and 130 to contain IP routes.
	TLVs 128 and 130 have a Metric field that consists of 4 Type
of Service (TOS)
	metrics.  The first metric, the so-called "default metric", has the
	high-order bit reserved (bit 8).  Routers must set this bit to zero
	on transmission, and ignore it on receipt.

      </t>
      <t>
	
	This document redefines this high-order bit in the default Metric
	field in TLVs 128 and 130 to be the up/down bit.  L1L2 routers MUST
	set this bit to one for prefixes that are derived from L2 routing and
	are advertised into L1 LSPs.  The bit MUST be set to zero for all
	other IP prefixes in L1 or L2 LSPs.  Prefixes with the up/down bit
	set that are learned via L1 routing MUST NOT be advertised by L1L2
	routers back into L2.

      </t>
      <section title="Clarification of External Route-Type and External
		      Metric-Type">
	<t>

	  RFC 1195 defines two TLVs for carrying IP prefixes.  TLV 128 is
	  defined as "IP Internal Reachability Information", and should be used
	  to carry IP prefixes that are directly connected to IS-IS routers.
	  TLV 130 is defined as "IP External Reachability Information", and
	  should be used to carry routes learned from outside the IS-IS domain.
	  RFC 1195 documents TLV type 130 only for level 2 LSPs.

	</t>
	<t>
	  
	  RFC 1195 also defines two types of metrics.  Metrics of the internal
	  metric-type should be used when the metric is comparable to metrics
	  used to weigh links inside the IS-IS domain.  Metrics of the external
	  metric-type should be used if the metric of an IP prefix cannot be
	  directly compared to internal metrics. The external metric-type can only
	  be used for external IP prefixes.  A direct result is that
metrics of the external metric-type should never be seen in TLV 128.

	</t>
	<t>
	  
	  To prevent confusion, this document states again that when a router
	  computes IP routes, it MUST give the same preference to IP routes
	  advertised in an "IP Internal Reachability Information" TLV and IP
	  routes advertised in an "IP External Reachability Information" TLV.
	  RFC 1195 states this quite clearly in the note in paragraph 3.10.2,
	  item 2c).  This document does not alter this rule of preference.

	</t>
	<t>
	  
	  <list style="hanging">
	    <t hangText='NOTE:'>

	      Internal routes (routes to destinations announced in the
	      "IP Internal Reachability Information" field) and external
	      routes using internal metrics (routes to destinations announced
	      in the "IP External Reachability Information" field, with a
	      metric of type "internal") are treated identically for the
	      purpose of the order of preference of routes, and the Dijkstra
	      calculation.

	    </t>
	  </list>

	</t>
	<t>
	  
	  However, IP routes advertised in "IP External Reachability
	  Information" with the external metric-type MUST be given less preference
	  than the same IP routes advertised with the internal metric-type,
	  regardless of the value of the metrics.

	</t>
	<t>
	  
	  While IS-IS routers MUST NOT give different preference to IP prefixes
	  learned via "IP Internal Reachability Information" and "IP External
	  Reachability Information" when executing the Dijkstra calculation,
	  routers that implement multiple IGPs are free to use this distinction
	  between internal and external routes when comparing routes derived
	  from different IGPs for inclusion in their global Routing
Information Base (RIB).

	</t>
      </section>
      <section title='Definition of External IP Prefixes in Level 1
		      LSPs'>
	<t>	  

	  RFC 1195 does not define the "IP External Reachability Information"
	  TLV for L1 LSPs.  However, there is no reason why an IS-IS
	  implementation could not allow for redistribution of external routes
	  into L1.  Some IS-IS implementations already allow network
	  administrators to do this.  This document loosens the restrictions in
	  RFC 1195 and allows for the inclusion of the "IP External
	  Reachability Information" TLV in L1 LSPs.

	</t>
	<t>
	  
	  RFC 1195 defines that IP routes learned via L1 routing must always be
	  advertised in L2 LSPs in an "IP Internal Reachability Information"
	  TLV.  Now that this document allows "IP External Reachability
	  Information" TLVs in L1 LSPs and allows for the advertisement of
	  routes learned via L2 routing into L1, the above rule needs an
	  extension.

	</t>
	<t>
	  
	  When an L1L2 router advertises an L1 route into L2, where that L1
	  route was learned via a prefix advertised in an "IP External
	  Reachability Information" TLV, that L1L2 router SHOULD advertise
	  that prefix in its L2 LSP within an "IP External Reachability
	  Information" TLV.  L1 routes learned via an "IP Internal
	  Reachability Information" TLV SHOULD still be advertised within an
	  "IP Internal Reachability Information" TLV.  These rules should
	  also be applied when advertising IP routes derived from L2
	  routing into L1. Of course in this case, the up/down bit MUST
	  be set also.

	</t>
	<t>
	  
	  RFC 1195 defines that if a router sees the same external prefix
	  advertised by two or more routers with the same external metric, it
	  must select the route that is advertised by the router that is
	  closest to itself.  It should be noted that now that external routes
	  can be advertised from L1 into L2, and vice versa, the router
	  that advertises an external prefix in its LSP might not be the router
	  that originally injected this prefix into the IS-IS domain.
	  Therefore, it is less useful to advertise external routes with
	  external metrics into other levels.

	</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title='Types of IP Routes in IS-IS and Their Order of
	  Preference'>
      <t>

	RFC 1195 and this document define several ways of advertising IP
	routes in IS-IS. There are four variables involved.

	<list style='numbers'>
	  <t>

	    The level of the LSP in which the route is advertised.  There are
	    currently two possible values: level 1 and level 2.

	  </t>
	  <t>

	    The route-type, which can be derived from the type of TLV in which
	    the prefix is advertised.  Internal routes are advertised in IP
	    Internal Reachability Information TLVs (TLV 128), and external
	    routes are advertised in IP External Reachability Information TLVs
	    (TLV 130).

	  </t>
	  <t>

	    The metric-type: internal or external. The metric-type is derived
	    from the internal/external metric-type bit in the Metric field
	    (bit 7).
	    
	  </t>
	  <t>

	    The fact whether this route is leaked down in the hierarchy, and
	    thus can not be advertised back up.  This information can be
	    derived from the newly defined up/down bit in the default Metric
	    field.
	   
	  </t>

	<t>

	  The combination IP Internal Reachability Information and external
	  metric-type is not allowed. Also, the up/down bit MUST NOT be set
	  in L2 LSPs.  This leaves us with 8 different types of IP
	  advertisements in IS-IS.  However, there are more than 8 reasons
	  for IP prefixes to be advertised in IS-IS.  The following list
	  describes the types of IP prefixes and how they are encoded.

		      Routes in IS-IS'> 
	<t>
	  
	  Unfortunately, IS-IS cannot depend on metrics alone for route
	  selection.  Some types of routes must always be preferred over
	  others, regardless of the costs that were computed in the
	  Dijkstra calculation.  One of the reasons for this is that
	  inter-area routes can only be advertised with a maximum metric of
	  63.  Another reason is that this maximum value of 63 does not
	  mean infinity (e.g., like a hop count of 16 in RIP denotes
	  unreachable).  Introducing a value for infinity cost in IS-IS
	  inter-area routes would introduce counting- to-infinity behavior
	  via two or more L1L2 routers, which would have a bad impact on
	  network stability.

	</t>
	<t>

	  The order of preference of IP routes in IS-IS is based on a few
	  assumptions.

	    </t>
	    <t>

	      The note in RFC 1195, paragraph 3.10.2, item 2c) defines that
	      internal routes with internal metric-type and external prefixes
	      with internal metric-type have the same preference.

      <section title='Additional Notes on What Prefixes to Accept or
		      Advertise'> 
	<t>

	  <xref target='RTL'/> enumerates all used IP route-types
	  in IS-IS.  Besides these defined route-types, the encoding used
	  would allow for a few more potential combinations.  One of them
	  is the combination of "IP Internal Reachability Information" and
	  external metric-type.  This combination SHOULD NOT be used when
	  building an LSP.  Upon receipt of an IP prefix with this
	  combination, routers MUST ignore this prefix.  Another issue
	  would be the usage of the up/down bit in L2 LSPs.  Because IS-IS
	  is currently defined with two levels of hierarchy, there should
	  never be a need to set the up/down bit in L2 LSPs.  However, if
	  IS-IS would ever be extended with more than two levels of
	  hierarchy, L2-only (or L1L2) routers will need to be able to
	  accept L2 IP routes with the up/down bit set.  Therefore, it is
	  RECOMMENDED that implementations ignore the up/down bit in L2
	  LSPs, and accept the prefixes in L2 LSPs regardless of whether the
	  up/down bit is set.  This will allow for simpler migration once
	  more than two levels of hierarchy are defined.

	</t>
	<t>

	  Another detail that implementors should be aware of is the fact that
	  L1L2 routers SHOULD only advertise in their L2 LSP those L1 routes
	  that they use for forwarding themselves.  They SHOULD NOT
	  unconditionally advertise into L2 all prefixes from LSPs in the L1
	  database.

	</t>
	<t>

	  Not all prefixes need to be advertised up or down the hierarchy.
	  Implementations might allow for additional manual filtering or
	  summarization to further bring down the number of inter-area prefixes
	  they advertise in their LSPs.  It is also RECOMMENDED that the
	  default configuration of L1L2 routers not advertise any L2
	  routes into L1 (see also <xref target='interop'/>).

	</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor='interop' title='Inter-Operability with Older
				     Implementations'> 
      <t>

	The solution in this document is not fully compatible with RFC 1195.
	It is an extension to RFC 1195.  If routers do not use the new
	functionality of external L1 routes or L2->L1 inter-area routes,
	older implementations that strictly follow RFC 1195 will be
	compatible with newer implementations that follow this document.

      </t>
      <t>

	Implementations that do not accept the "IP External Reachability
	Information" TLV in L1 LSPs will not be able to compute external L1
	routes.  This could cause routing loops between L1-only routers that
	do understand external L1 routes for a particular destination, and
	L1-only routers that use the default route pointing to the closest
	attached L1L2 router for that destination.

      </t>
      <t>

   Implementations that follow RFC 1195 SHOULD ignore bit 8 in the
   default Metric field when computing routes. Therefore, even older
	implementations that do not know of the up/down bit should be able to
	accept the new L2->L1 inter-area routes.  These older implementations
	will install the new L2->L1 inter-area routes as L1 intra-area
	routes, but that in itself does not cause routing loops among L1-only
	routers.

      </t>
      <t>

	However, it is vital that the up/down bit is recognized by L1L2
	routers.  As has been stated before, L1L2 routers MUST NOT
	advertise L2->L1 inter-area routes back into L2.  Therefore, if L2
	routes are advertised down into an L1 area, it is required that all
	L1L2 routers in that area run software that understands the new
	up/down bit.  Older implementations that follow RFC 1195 and do not
	understand the new up/down bit will treat the L2->L1 inter-area
	routes as L1 intra-area routes, and they will advertise these
	routes back into L2.  This can cause routing loops, sub-optimal
	routing, or extra routing instability.  For this reason, it is
	RECOMMENDED that implementations by default not advertise any L2
	routes into L1.  Implementations SHOULD force the network
	administrator to manually configure L1L2 routers to advertise any
	L2 routes into L1.

      </t>
    </section>

    <section title='Comparisons with Other Proposals'>
      <t>

	In <xref target='RFC5305'/>, a new TLV is defined to transport IP
	prefix information.  This TLV format also defines an up/down bit to
	allow for L2->L1 inter-area routes.  RFC 5305 also defines a new
	TLV to describe links.  Both TLVs have wider metric space and have
	the possibility to define sub-TLVs to advertise extra information
	belonging to the link or prefix.  The wider metric space in IP
	prefix TLVs allows for more granular metric information about
	inter-area path costs.  To make full use of the wider metric space,
	network administrators must deploy both new TLVs at the same time.

      </t>
      <t>

	Deployment of RFC 5305 requires an upgrade of all routers in the
	network and a transition to the new TLVs.  Such a network-wide
	upgrade and transition might not be an easy task.  In this case,
	the solution defined in this document, which requires only an
	upgrade of L1L2 routers in selected areas, might be a good
	alternative to the solution defined in 5305.
