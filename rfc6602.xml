<t>
For extending the lifetime of a mobility session, the Proxy Mobile IPv6
specification requires the mobile access gateway to send a Proxy Binding
Update message to the local mobility anchor on a per-session basis. In the
absence of signaling semantics for performing operations with group-specific
scope, this results in a significant amount of signaling traffic on a periodic
basis between a given mobile access gateway and a local mobility anchor.
This document defines optimizations to the binding update and
revocation operations in Proxy Mobile IPv6 for performing operations with
group-specific scope with the use of a group identifier.

<section title="Introduction">
<t>
The Proxy Mobile IPv6 base specification <xref target="RFC5213"/> requires
the Mobile Node Identifier option to be present in the mobility signaling
messages, such as in the Proxy Binding Update (PBU) and Proxy Binding
Acknowledgement (PBA)
messages. It essentially limits the operational scope of the binding update
operation to a single mobility session. These signaling messages lack the
capability to identify a group of mobility sessions, so the operations related
to binding update and
revocation can be performed on all the mobility sessions
that are part of that group.
</t>


<t>
There is a need to have semantics for associating a group identity to a mobility 
session, so the scope of the operations related to binding update and revocation  
can be extended to all the mobility sessions identified by the group identifier.
The group identifier therefore provides a considerably improved mechanism for
protocol operations that would otherwise require multiple atomic transactions
on a per-mobility-session basis. Following are some of the use cases where the
group identifier can be used.
</t>


<t><list style="symbols">
<t>
For extending the lifetime of a mobility session, the mobile access gateway (MAG)
periodically sends a Proxy Binding Update message to the local mobility anchor (LMA) on a
per-session basis. This process can be optimized by allowing the mobile access
gateway to send a single Proxy Binding Update  <xref target="RFC5213"/> message for a
group of mobility sessions identified by a group identifier. Upon accepting
the request, the local mobility anchor
can update the lifetime of all the mobility sessions that
are part of that group.
</t>

<t>
On detecting the failure of a specific service card, a local mobility anchor, or a mobile access gateway service hosted on blade architecture
system, can potentially request the
peer to revoke all the sessions identified by a
common group identifier that are hosted on that service card. Potentially, a
single Binding Revocation Indication <xref target="RFC5846"/>
message carrying the group identifier can be used to revoke all the sessions hosted on that
service card, which otherwise needs to be handled on a per-session basis.
</t>

This document defines a new mobility option, the Mobile Node Group Identifier
option, and
the extensions to procedures related to binding update and binding revocation
for performing
binding operations with group-specific scope.

All the mobility-related terms used in this document are to be interpreted as

terms: 
</t>


<t>
Bulk Binding Update
</t>
<t>
<list style="hanging">
<t>
A binding update operation that has group-specific scope. A binding operation
is associated with a specific mobility session. However, a bulk binding update
operation is associated with multiple mobility sessions. This operation is not
relevant for new mobility session creation.
</t>
</list>
</t>


<t>
Bulk Binding Update Group
</t>
<t>
<list style="hanging">
<t>
A group of mobility sessions that are part of the same logical group and
therefore share a common group identifier. This group is the bulk binding
update group. This bulk binding update group is maintained by both the mobile
access gateway and the local mobility anchor, and the grouping logic is local
to that node. A mobility session can therefore be identified by two bulk
binding update group identifiers, one specific group created by the mobile access
gateway and the other specific group created by the local mobility anchor. The
bulk binding update group identifiers are exchanged as part of the initial mobility
session creation. The mobility entities thereafter can perform 
operations related to binding update
such as lifetime extension and revocation operations on an entire
bulk binding update group identified by the group identifier. 
</t>
</list>
</t>

</section> 
</section>



<section anchor="overview" title="Bulk Binding Update Overview">


<section title="Motivation">
<t>
In a typical Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, a local mobility anchor serves multiple mobile
access gateways, and the capacity of that node with respect to the number of mobility 
sessions that it can host is quite high, typically in the order of a few millions. 
As the number of mobility sessions hosted by a  local mobility anchor goes up, so does
the amount of signaling traffic related to periodic binding update traffic. 
</t>

<t>
The currently specified approach of the binding update procedure for
extending the lifetimes of multiple mobility sessions (where the mobile
access gateway is required
to send a unique binding update message for each mobility session
even when there is no change to the session state) is inefficient or
sub-optimal.
These periodic binding update messages consume a significant amount of
network resources at both the peers, in terms of processing power and
network bandwidth.
There is an opportunity to optimize the signaling procedures by
allowing the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway to perform bulk binding
update operations. This document specifies extensions to Proxy Mobile IPv6  signaling for
performing binding update and revocation operations on a group of mobility sessions. These
extensions do not take away the existing functionality of performing binding operations
on a single mobility session.
</t>


</section>




<section title="General Operation">
<t>
The bulk binding update mechanism specified in this document allows the mobile
access gateway and the local mobility anchor to perform binding update and revocation
operations on a group of mobility sessions. As part of the initial signaling during mobility
session establishment, the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway exchange
the respective bulk binding update group identifiers for that mobility session. Subsequently,
both the  peers can perform bulk operations on those groups by presenting the bulk binding
update group identifier in the signaling messages.
</t>


<t>
When sending a Proxy Binding Update message after detecting
a new mobile node on its access link, a mobile access gateway can request the local mobility anchor to assign
a bulk binding update group identifier for the mobile node's mobility session. This is
indicated by setting the (B) flag in the Proxy Binding Update to a value of (1). The
mobile access gateway will also assign a bulk binding update group identifier (or it
may assign a default  bulk binding update group - ALL-SESSIONS) and include that in the
Mobile Node Group Identifier option.
</t>

<t>
Upon accepting the request, the local mobility anchor will group the mobility session to
a specific bulk binding update group (or it may assign it to the default bulk binding
update group - ALL-SESSIONS) and return this bulk binding update group
identifier in a Proxy
Binding Acknowledgement message. It will also set the (B) flag in the Proxy Binding
Acknowledgement message to a value of (1). The bulk binding update group identifier is
carried in the Mobile Node Group Identifier option, described in
<xref target="mnid_option"/>.
</t>

<t>
Once the bulk binding update group identifiers are exchanged, the local mobility anchor
and the mobile access gateway can perform binding operations on those entire groups, by
including the bulk binding update group identifier in the signaling messages. For example,
the mobile access gateway can extend the lifetime of all the mobility sessions that are
part of a group by sending a single Proxy Binding Update message with that bulk binding update
group identifier. Similarly, the local mobility anchor can revoke all the mobility sessions
that are part of a group by including that group identifier in the Proxy Binding Revocation
message. When initiating bulk binding update operations on a group of mobility sessions, the
group identifier that is carried in the Mobile Node Group Identifier option is always the 
identifier of the local group, and not the identifier of the group on the peer.

(1) to (2): The MAG detects the mobile node's (MN1) attachment to the access link.
The MAG groups the mobile node to a specific bulk binding update group, (M1). The MAG
notifies this group identifier to the LMA by including it in the Mobile Node 
Group Identifier option of the PBU message.
</t>

<t>
(3): Upon accepting the PBU, the LMA creates a mobility session and groups the mobility
session to a specific bulk binding update group, (L1). The LMA updates the
mobile node's Binding Cache entry to
include the bulk binding update group identifier, (L1), and the bulk binding update group identifier
presented by the MAG, (M1). The LMA also notifies the MAG about the bulk binding update group identifier
(L1), by  including it in the PBA.
</t>

<t>
(4) to (5): Upon receiving the PBA, the MAG updates the Binding Update List entry for that mobility session to
include the bulk binding update group identifiers (L1) and (M1). At this point, both the LMA and MAG are aware
of the mobile node's bulk binding update group identifiers assigned by the peers. 
</t>

<t>
(6) to (9): The above steps (1 through 5) are repeated here for MN2 and MN3; details are omitted.
At the end of step (9), the MAG completes the signaling with the LMA. The MAG assigns the mobile nodes
MN2 and MN3 to bulk binding update groups (M1) and (M2) respectively, while the LMA
assigns them both to the same bulk binding update group, (L1). 
</t>

<t>
At this point, LMA has assigned MN1, MN2, and MN3 to the bulk binding update group
(L1), while the MAG has assigned MN1 and MN2 to group (M1) and MN3 to group (M2). Both 
peers can now perform binding operations on a group of mobility sessions identified by the
respective bulk binding update group identifier.
</t>

<t>
(10) to (13): The MAG sends a Proxy Binding Update message for extending the lifetime
of all the mobility sessions that are part of the bulk binding update group (M1). It includes the 
bulk binding update group identifier (M1) in the PBU. Upon accepting the PBU, the LMA extends the lifetime
of both MN1 and MN2, which are part of the group (M1). 
</t>

<t>
(14) to (17): The LMA decides to revoke all the sessions that are part of bulk
binding update group (L1). The
LMA sends a Binding Revocation Indication (BRI) message with the bulk binding
update group identifier (L1). Upon accepting the BRI
message, the MAG revokes all the MN1, MN2, and MN3 mobility sessions, which are
part of that bulk binding update group (L1), and sends a Binding Revocation
Acknowledgement (BRA) <xref target="RFC5846"/> message.

<section title="Requesting Bulk Binding Update Support for a Mobility Session">
<t>
The following are the considerations for the mobile access gateway for requesting
bulk binding update support for a mobility session.
</t>



<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
When sending a Proxy Binding Update message to the local mobility anchor, the
mobile access gateway can choose to request that the local mobility anchor 
enable bulk binding update support for the mobility session associated
with that Proxy Binding Update request. When making such request, the Bulk-Binding-Update
flag (B) in the request MUST be set to a value of (1) and the Mobile Node Group Identifier
option MUST be present. The decision to request bulk binding update support for a
mobile node is a matter of local policy at the mobile access gateway and is controlled by
the configuration variable RequestBulkBindingUpdateSupportForMobilitySession. 
</t>

<t>
The mobile access gateway MUST assign a bulk binding update group identifier for the
mobility session. Considerations on how the mobile access gateway assigns a group 
identifier to a mobility session is outside the scope of this document. This group identifier
can be unique to the service card on which the mobility session is hosted or based on other 
grouping considerations. When no such group assignment is done, the mobile access
gateway SHOULD assign the default group identifier value of (ALL-SESSIONS). This assigned
group identifier value MUST be present in the Mobile Node Group Identifier option, and
the sub-type value in the option MUST be set to the value of (1) (Bulk Binding
Update Group).
</t>


<t>
If the received Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message has the status code value set to (0)
(Proxy Binding Update accepted) and the Bulk-Binding-Update flag (B) set to a value of (0),
in response to a Proxy Binding Update request
with the Bulk-Binding-Update flag (B) set to a value of (1), it is an indication that the
local mobility anchor has denied the request for enabling bulk binding update support
for that mobility session and that the mobility session is not associated with any 
bulk binding update group.  The mobile access gateway SHOULD set the bulk binding update
group identifier values LMA-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id and MAG-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id
to (0) in the Binding Update List entry for that mobility session. Furthermore, the
mobility session should be excluded from any bulk binding update operations.
</t>

<t>
If the received Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message has the status code value set to (0)
(Proxy Binding Update accepted) and the Bulk-Binding-Update flag (B) in the reply is set to
a value of (1), it is an indication that the local mobility anchor has accepted the request to allow
bulk binding update support for that mobility session. Furthermore, the Mobile Node Group Identifier
option in the reply, with the sub-type value of (1) (Bulk Binding Update Group), contains the bulk
binding update group identifier for that mobility session assigned by the local mobility anchor.
The mobile access gateway MUST update the LMA-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id and
MAG-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id parameters in the  Binding Update List entry for that mobility
session. However, if the received Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message has the Bulk-Binding-Update
flag (B) set to a value of (1), but the Mobile Node Group Identifier option is not present, the
message MUST be considered malformed and ignored.  
</t>

<t>
If, at any point in time, the mobile access gateway chooses to request the local mobility anchor to
disable bulk binding update support for a mobility session, it MUST send a Proxy Binding Update
message with the (B) flag set to a value of (0), and the Mobile Node Group Identifier option MUST NOT
be present. This message is sent as a normal binding update request for lifetime extension.
Requirements from Section 6.9.1 of  <xref target="RFC5213"/> apply. Furthermore, the mobile
access gateway MUST update the Binding Update List entry by setting the bulk binding update group identifier
values LMA-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id and MAG-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id
to (0), and the
mobility session MUST be excluded from any bulk binding update operations.

<section title="Supporting Bulk Binding Updates">
<t>
The following section identifies the considerations for a mobile access gateway
performing binding update and revocation operations with group-specific
scope.
</t>

<t>
<list style="symbols">

<t>
For extending the lifetime of all mobility sessions that share the same
bulk binding update group identifier, the mobile access gateway can choose to send a
bulk binding update request. To make such a request, it can send a Proxy Binding
Update message to the local mobility anchor, including the Mobile Node Group Identifier
option with the sub-type value of (1) (Bulk Binding Update Group) and with the 
Bulk-Binding-Update flag (B) set to a value of (0). The identifier value in the
option MUST be set to the bulk binding update group identifier of the group for which
bulk binding update operation is being requested.  The message MUST NOT include any
individual session identifiers such as the Mobile Node Identifier option <xref
target="RFC4283"/>, the
Home Network Prefix option <xref target="RFC5213"/>, the IPv4 Home Address Request
option <xref target="RFC5844"/>, or the GRE Key option <xref target="RFC5845"/>. 
All the considerations from Section 5.3.3 of <xref target="RFC5213"/>
MUST be followed when sending the bulk binding update request, with the exception
related to the use of Mobile Node Group Identifier option in place of the individual session
identifiers (Mobile Node Identifier option, Home Network Prefix option, GRE Key option, and
IPv4 Home Address Request option).
</t>

<t>
When requesting binding revocation for all the sessions that share the same
bulk binding update group identifier, the mobile access gateway can choose to send a bulk
revocation request.  To make such a request, it can send a Binding Revocation Indication
message <xref target="RFC5846"/> to the local mobility anchor, including the Mobile Node
Group Identifier option with the sub-type value of (1) (Bulk Binding Update Group). The
identifier value in the option MUST be set to the bulk binding update group identifier of
the group for which bulk binding update operation is being requested. The message MUST NOT
include any individual session identifiers such as the Mobile Node Identifier option 
<xref target="RFC4283"/>, the Home Network Prefix option <xref target="RFC5213"/>, the IPv4
Home Address Request option <xref target="RFC5844"/>, or the GRE Key option
<xref target="RFC5845"/>. All the considerations from Section 9.2 of <xref target="RFC5846"/>
MUST be followed when sending the bulk binding update request, with the exception
related to the use of Mobile Node Group Identifier option in place of the individual session
identifiers (Mobile Node Identifier option, Home Network Prefix option, GRE Key option, 
IPv4 Home Address Request option).
</t>


<t>
Any time the mobile access gateway receives a Binding Revocation Indication message
<xref target="RFC5846"/>, with a Mobile Node Group Identifier option present in the request
and with the sub-type value of (1) (Bulk Binding Update Group), this message serves as a bulk
revocation request, with the request scope for revoking of all the mobility
sessions that 
are part of that bulk binding update group specific to that local mobility anchor and
identified by the group identifier in the Mobile Node Group Identifier option.
</t>

<t>
All the considerations from  <xref target="RFC5846"/> apply when processing a binding
revocation request, except making the scope of the operation apply to a set of mobility sessions
identified by the bulk binding update group identifier present in the request.
</t>

<t>
If the received Binding Revocation Indication message includes the Mobile Node Identifier
option <xref target="RFC4283"/>, the Home Network Prefix option <xref target="RFC5213"/>, the
IPv4 Home Address Request option <xref target="RFC5844"/>, or the GRE Key option
<xref target="RFC5845"/>, the mobile access gateway MUST consider this as an invalid
message; it MUST reject the Binding Revocation Indication message and send a Binding
Revocation Acknowledgement message with the Status field set to a value of 128
(Binding Does NOT Exist).

<section title="LMA Considerations">
<t>
The following are the considerations relevant to a local mobility anchor when
supporting this specification.
</t>




<section title="Extensions to Binding Cache Entry Data Structure">
<t>
The conceptual Binding Cache entry data structure maintained by the local mobility
anchor, described in Section 5.1 of <xref target="RFC5213"/>, is extended to include
the following REQUIRED additional fields.
</t>


<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
MAG-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id 
<vspace blankLines="1" />
This is the bulk binding update group identifier
assigned by the mobile access gateway for this mobility session. It is a 32-bit
unsigned integer. This identifier is received in the Mobile Node Group Identifier
option of the Proxy Binding Update message. This identifier is not globally
unique within a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain; the same group identifier value may be
used by other nodes.
</t>

<t>
LMA-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id 
<vspace blankLines="1" />
This is the bulk binding update group identifier 
assigned by this local mobility anchor for this mobility session. It is a 32-bit
unsigned integer. This identifier is not globally unique within a Proxy Mobile IPv6
domain; the same group identifier value may be used by other nodes.
</t>
</list>
</t>

</section>




<section title="Enabling Bulk Binding Update Support for a Mobility Session">
<t>
The local mobility anchor will process a received Proxy Binding Update 
message as specified in <xref target="RFC5213"/>. However, if the (B) flag in
the received Proxy Binding Update message is set to a value of (1) and if it
includes a Mobile Node Group Identifier option with the sub-type value of (1)
(Bulk Binding Update Group), the following processing takes place:
</t>

<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
If the (B) flag in the received Proxy Binding Update message is set to a value
of (1) and if the Mobile Node Group Identifier option is present in the request,
the message serves as a request to the local mobility anchor to enable bulk 
binding update support for that mobility session.
</t>


<t>
Upon successful processing and acceptance of the Proxy Binding Update, the local
mobility anchor can choose to enable bulk binding update support for this mobility
session. The decision whether to enable bulk binding update support for that mobility
session is a matter of local policy and is controlled by the configuration variable
AcceptBulkBindingUpdateReqForMobilitySession.
</t>


<t>
For enabling the bulk binding update support for the mobility session, the local
mobility anchor MUST associate the mobility session to a specific bulk binding 
update group locally. The specific details on how the local mobility anchor associates
the given mobility session to a specific bulk binding update group is outside the
scope of this document. The local mobility anchor can choose to assign a default 
bulk binding update group identifier value of (ALL-SESSIONS), indicating that all
the mobility sessions from that mobile access gateway are part of that group. 
The local mobility anchor SHOULD update the bulk binding update group identifier values
in the Binding Cache entry, LMA-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id and
MAG-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id, to the respective values.
</t>

<t>
If the bulk binding update support is enabled for the mobile node's mobility
session, the local mobility anchor MUST send the assigned bulk binding update group
identifier as part of the Mobile Node Group Identifier option, with the
sub-type value of (1)
(Bulk Binding Update Group) in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message that it sends
to the mobile access gateway. The (B) flag in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message
MUST be set to value of (1).
</t>

<t>
If the bulk binding update support is not enabled for the mobility session,
the local mobility anchor MUST NOT include the Mobile Node Group Identifier option with
the sub-type value of (1) (Bulk Binding Update Group), in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
message that it sends to the mobile access gateway. Furthermore,  the (B) flag in the
Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message MUST be set to value of (0). It is to be noted that
the Mobile Node Group  Identifier option is a generic option and new sub-types may be
defined by future specifications.
</t>

<t>
If the received Proxy Binding Update message is not a bulk binding update request,
(i.e., the (B) flag is set to a value of (0) and the Mobile Node Group Identifier option
with the sub-type value of (1) (Bulk Binding Update Group) is not present), but is a request
for extending the lifetime of an existing mobility session, for which the bulk binding update
support is already enabled, then the local mobility anchor MUST process the request as
specified in <xref target="RFC5213"/>. However, the value of (0) in the (B) flag in the
message serves as a request for the local mobility anchor to disable bulk binding update
support for that mobility session. Upon accepting the request, the local mobility anchor
SHOULD set the parameters, LMA-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id and MAG-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id
in the Binding Cache entry to a value of (0) and the mobility session MUST be excluded from
any bulk binding update operations.
</t>

<t>
Any time the local mobility anchor detects that the mobile node has roamed
and changed its point of attachment to a new mobile access gateway, it SHOULD
also update the bulk binding update group identifier of the mobility session.
Additionally, it should also update the existing group identifiers associated with that
session. As part of sending the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement to the new mobile access gateway,
it MUST include the updated group identifier in the Mobile Node Group Identifier option,  with
a sub-type value of (1).  However, if the if the received Proxy Binding Update from the new
mobile access gateway did not have the (B) flag set to a value of (1), then it MUST NOT
include the mobility session in any of bulk binding update group and MUST NOT include
the Mobile Node Group Identifier option with the sub-type value of (1).
</t>


<t>
Any time a mobile node's mobility session is de-registered by the mobile access gateway, or
the session is revoked for administrative or any other reasons, the mobility session MUST 
also be removed from the bulk binding update group.

<section title="Supporting Bulk Binding Updates">
<t>
The following section identifies the considerations for a local mobility anchor for
performing bulk binding update and revocation operations with group-specific scope.
</t>


<t>
<list style="symbols">
	
<t>
Any time the local mobility anchor receives a Proxy Binding Update message with
the (B) flag in the request set to a value of (0) and a Mobile Node Group 
Identifier option present in the request with sub-type value of (1) (Bulk 
Binding Update Group), the local mobility anchor MUST consider the request a
bulk binding update request, with the request scope including all the mobility
sessions that are part of that bulk binding update group, specific to that 
mobile access gateway, and identified by the group identifier in Mobile Node
Group Identifier option. 

However, if the received request also includes any individual session identifiers
such as the Mobile Node Identifier option <xref target="RFC4283"/>, the Home Network
Prefix option  <xref target="RFC5213"/>, the IPv4 Home Address Request option
<xref target="RFC5844"/>, or the GRE Key option <xref target="RFC5845"/>, the
local mobility anchor MUST consider this as an  invalid message; it MUST reject
the Proxy Binding Update message and send a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message
with the Status field set to INVALID_MOBILE_NODE_GROUP_IDENTIFIER (Invalid group
identifier value in the request).
</t>

<t>
The local mobility anchor MUST consider the message as a request for extending
the lifetime of all the mobility sessions that are associated with the group
identifier in the Mobile Node Group Identifier option. However, if the 
Mobile Node Group Identifier option with the sub-type value of (1)
(Bulk Binding Update Group) has an unknown group identifier, then the local
mobility anchor MUST reject the Proxy Binding Update message and send a Proxy
Binding Acknowledgement message with the Status field set to
INVALID_MOBILE_NODE_GROUP_IDENTIFIER (Invalid group identifier value in
the request). 
</t>


<t>
Upon accepting the bulk binding update request, the local mobility anchor
SHOULD extend the lifetime for all the mobility sessions that are part of the
bulk binding update group identified by the group identifier in the Mobile Node
Group Identifier in the message. Considerations from  <xref target="RFC5213"/>
MUST be applied for extending the lifetime of a mobile node's session. It MUST
also send a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message with the Status field value set to 0
(Proxy Binding Update accepted). The lifetime field in the message MUST be set
to the allocated lifetime for all the mobility sessions. The message MUST
also include the Mobile Node Group Identifier option, with the sub-type value of (1)
(Bulk Binding Update Group) and with the identifier value copied from the Mobile
Node Group Identifier option present in the received Proxy Binding Update message.
</t>

<t>
If the local mobility anchor rejects the bulk binding update request for any
administrative reason, then it MUST NOT update the lifetime in the Binding
Cache entries of any of the mobile nodes identified by the group identifier.
The local mobility anchor SHOULD send a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement indicating
the reason for the rejection in the status code.
</t>

<t>
Any time the local mobility anchor receives a Binding Revocation Indication
Message <xref target="RFC5846"/> with a Mobile Node Group Identifier option
present in the request and with the sub-type value of (1) (Bulk Binding Update Group),
the local mobility anchor MUST consider the request as a bulk revocation request,
with the request scope including all the mobility sessions that are part of
the bulk binding update group specific to that mobile access gateway and identified
by the group identifier in Mobile Node Group Identifier option.
However, if the received request also includes the Mobile Node Identifier option <xref target="RFC4283"/>,
the Home Network Prefix option <xref target="RFC5213"/>, the IPv4 Home Address Request option
<xref target="RFC5844"/>, or the GRE Key option <xref target="RFC5845"/>,  the local
mobility anchor MUST consider this as an invalid message; it MUST reject the Binding
Revocation Indication message and send a BRA  message
with the Status field set to a value of 128 (Binding Does NOT Exist). All the
considerations from  <xref target="RFC5846"/> apply when processing a binding revocation
request, except making the scope of the operation apply to a set of mobility sessions
identified by the group identifier present in the request.
</t>

<t>
Upon accepting the Binding Revocation Indication request and completing the
operation, the local mobility anchor MUST send a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement
message with the Status field set to a value of 0 (success). The message MUST
include the Mobile Node Group Identifier option, with the identifier
value copied from the Mobile Node Group Identifier option present in the
received Binding Revocation Indication message.

Per this document, IANA has done the following:
</t>

<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
Action-1: This specification defines a new flag (B) to the Proxy Binding

described in <xref target="pba-message"/>. The value of the flag (B) 
has been allocated from the "Binding Acknowledgement Flags" registry.
</t>

<t>
Action-3: This specification defines a new Mobility Header option, the Mobile
Node Group Identifier option. This option is described in <xref target="mnid_option"/>.
The Type value for this option has been assigned in the same number
space as allocated for the other mobility options <xref target="RFC6275"/>.
</t>

<t>
Action-4: The Sub-type field of the Mobile Node Group Identifier
option introduces a new number space.  This number space is now
managed by IANA, under the Registry, "Mobile Node Group
Identifier Type Registry".  This specification reserves the sub-
type value of (1) (Bulk Binding Update Group).  Approval of new
sub-type values are to be made through IANA Expert Review.
The value range of this field is 0 through 255, but the values 0 and

Action-5: This document also defines a new status value
INVALID_MOBILE_NODE_GROUP_IDENTIFIER (Invalid group identifier value in the

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
<t>
The Mobile Node Group Identifier option defined in this specification is for
use in Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement messages. This
option is carried like any other mobility header option, and it does not require
any other special security considerations.
</t>

<t>
The bulk binding update and the bulk revocation operations specified in this
document perform operations on a group of mobility sessions. If proper authorization
checks are not in place, a malicious node may be able to hijack a mobile node's
mobility session or may carry out a denial-of-service attack.  To prevent this
attack, this specification requires the local mobility anchor to allow only
authorized mobile access gateways to perform bulk operations.
