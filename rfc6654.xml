    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes an alternative IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4
      Infrastructures (6rd) deployment model to that of RFC 5969.  The basic
      6rd model allows IPv6 hosts to gain access to IPv6 networks across an
      IPv4 access network using 6-in-4 tunnels. &nbsp;6rd requires support
      by a device (the 6rd customer edge, or 6rd-CE) on the customer site,
      which must also be assigned an IPv4 address.  The alternative model
      described in this document initiates the 6-in-4 tunnels from an
      operator-owned Gateway collocated with the operator's IPv4 network
      edge rather than from customer equipment, and hence is termed
      "Gateway-initiated 6rd" (GI 6rd).  The advantages of this approach are
      that it requires no modification to customer equipment and avoids
      assignment of IPv4 addresses to customer equipment. The latter point
      means less pressure on IPv4 addresses in a high-growth
      environment.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>   6rd <xref target="RFC5969"/> provides a transition tool for connecting IPv6
      devices across an IPv4 network to an IPv6 network, at which point the
      packets can be routed natively.  The network topology is shown in
      <xref target="fig_topol"/>.</t>

      <t>In <xref target="fig_topol"/>, the CE is the customer edge router.
      It is provisioned with a delegated IPv6 prefix, but it is also
      configured with an IPv4 address so that it is reachable through the
      IPv4 network.  If a public IPv4 address is provisioned to every
      customer, it will aggravate the pressure due to the IPv4 address
      shortage for operators faced with a high rate of growth in the number
      of broadband subscribers to their network.  The use of private
      addresses with 6rd avoids this particular difficulty but brings other
      complications. </t>
     
    </section>


    <section anchor="probStat" title="Problem Statement">

			<t>Consider an operator facing a high subscriber growth rate.  As a result
      of this growth rate, the operator faces pressure on its stock of available
      public IPv4 addresses.  For this reason, the operator is motivated to offer 
      IPv6 access as quickly as possible.  <xref target="fig_netCtxt"/> shows the
      sort of network situation envisioned in the present document.</t>

        <postamble>Specialized GW and BR functions are described in the next 
        section.</postamble>
      </figure>

      <t>The backbone network will be the first part of the operator's network
      to support IPv6.  The metro network is not so easily upgraded to support
      IPv6, since many devices need to be modified and there may be some impact 
      to existing services.  Thus, any means of providing IPv6 access has to 
      minimize the changes required to devices in the metro network.</t>

      <t>In contrast to the situation described for basic 6rd
      <xref target="RFC5569"/>, the operator is assumed to have no control over
      the capabilities of the IP devices on the customer premises.  As a result,
      the operator cannot assume that any of these devices are capable of 
      supporting 6rd. </t>

      <t>If the customer equipment is in bridged mode and IPv6 is deployed to 
      sites via a Service Provider's (SP's) IPv4 network, the IPv6-only host
      needs an IPv6 address to visit the IPv6 service.  In this scenario, 6to4 
      <xref target="RFC3056"/>
      or 6rd can be used.  However, each IPv6-only host may need one 
      corresponding IPv4 address when using a public IPv4 address in 6to4 or 6rd,
      which puts great address pressure on the operators.</t>
      
      <t>If the CPE in the above figure is acting in bridging mode, each host
      behind it needs to be directly assigned an IPv6 prefix so it can access
      IPv6 services. If the CPE is acting in routing mode, only the CPE needs
      to be assigned an IPv6 prefix, and it delegates prefixes to the hosts
      behind it.</t>

      <t>If the Gateway supports IPv4 only, then an IPv4 address must also 
      be assigned to each host (bridging mode) or to the CPE (routing mode).
      Both of these cases, but the bridging mode in particular, put pressure on the 
      provider's stock of IPv4 addresses.</t>
      
      <t>If the Gateway is dual stack, an arrangement may be possible whereby
      all communication between the Gateway and the customer site uses IPv6 
      and the need to assign IPv4 addresses to customer devices is avoided.
      A possible solution is presented in the next section.</t>

    </section><!-- probStat -->


    <section anchor="propSol" title="Proposed Solution">

      <t>For basic 6rd <xref target="RFC5969"/>, the 6rd CE initiates the
       6-in-4 tunnel to the dual-stack border router (i.e., the 6rd Border
      Relay in 6rd terminology) to carry its IPv6 traffic.  To avoid the
      requirement for customer premises equipment to fulfill this role, it
      is necessary to move the tunneling function to a network device. This
      document identifies a functional element, termed the 6rd Gateway, to
      perform this task.  In what follows, the 6rd Gateway and 6rd Border
      Relay are referred to simply as the Gateway and Border Relay,
      respectively.</t>

      <t>The functions of the Gateway are as follows:
     
      <list style="symbols">
     	  <t>to generate and allocate Gateway-initiated 6rd delegated prefixes 
     	  for IPv6-capable customer devices, as described in 
     	  <xref target="prefix"/>;</t>
         
        <t>to forward outgoing IPv6 packets through a tunnel to a Border Relay,
        which extracts and forwards them to an IPv6 network as for 6rd;</t>
         
        <t>to extract incoming IPv6 packets tunneled from the Border Relay
        and forward them to the correct user device.</t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>In the proposed solution, there is only one tunnel initiated from 
      each Gateway to the Border Relay, which greatly reduces the number of
      tunnels the Border Relay has to handle.  The deployment scenario
      consistent with the problem statement in <xref target="probStat"/>
      collocates the Gateway with the IP edge of the access network.  This 
      is shown in <xref target="fig_netCtxt"/>  and is the typical placement 
      of the Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) in a fixed broadband network.  
      By assumption, the metro network beyond the BNG is IPv4. Transport
      between the customer site and the Gateway is over Layer 2.</t>

      <t>The elements of the proposed solution are as follows:

      <list style="symbols">
     	  <t>The IPv6 prefix assigned to the customer site contains the
     	  compressed IPv4 address of the network-facing side of the Gateway,
     	  plus a manually provisioned or Gateway-generated customer site 
     	  identifier.  This is illustrated in <xref target="fig_addrFmt"/>.</t>
    
        <t>The Border Relay is able to route incoming IPv6 packets to the
        correct Gateway by extracting the compressed Gateway address from 
        the IPv6 destination address of the incoming packet, expanding it 
        to a full 32-bit IPv4 address, and setting it as the destination 
        address of the encapsulated packet.</t>
    
        <t>The Gateway can route incoming packets to the correct link after
        decapsulation using a mapping from either the full IPv6 prefix or 
        the customer site identifier extracted from that prefix to the 
        appropriate link.</t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <section anchor="prefix" title="Prefix Delegation">

       <t>Referring back to <xref target="fig_netCtxt"/>, prefix assignment
       to the customer equipment occurs in the normal fashion through the
       Gateway/IP edge, using either DHCPv6 or Stateless Address
       Autoconfiguration (SLAAC).  <xref target="fig_addrFmt"/> illustrates
       the structure of the assigned prefix, and how the components are
       derived, within the context of a complete address.</t>

|&lt;------ GI 6rd delegated prefix ------>|
          </artwork>        </figure>

        <t>The common prefix, i.e., the first p bits of the GI 6rd delegated 
        prefix, is configured in the Gateway. This part of the prefix is 
        common across multiple customers and multiple Gateways.  Multiple 
        common prefix values may be used in a network either for service 
        separation or for scalability.</t>

        <t>The Gateway Identifier is equal to the o low-order bits of the Gateway
        IPv4 address on the virtual link to the Border Relay.  The number of bits
        o is equal to (32 - IPv4MaskLen), where the latter is the length of the IPv4
        prefix from which the Gateway IPv4 addresses are derived.  The value of
        IPv4MaskLen is configured in both the Gateways and the Border Relays.</t>

        <t>The Customer Site Index is effectively a sequence number assigned to an
        individual customer site served by the Gateway.  The value of the index for
        a given customer site must be unique across the Gateway. The length n of 
        the Customer Site Index is provisioned in the Gateway and must be large 
        enough to accommodate the number of customer sites that the Gateway is 
        expected to serve.</t>
        
        <t>To give a numerical example, consider a 6rd domain containing ten
        million IPv6-capable customer devices (a rather high number given that
        6rd is meant for the early stages of IPv6 deployment).  The estimated
        number of 6rd Gateways needed to serve this domain would be on the
        order of 3,300, each serving 30,000 customer devices. Assuming
        best-case compression for the Gateway addresses, the Gateway Identifier
        field has length o = 12 bits. If 6-in-4 tunneling is being used, this
        best case is more likely to be achievable than it would be if the IPv4
        addresses belonged to the customer devices. The customer device index,
        which is a more controllable parameter, has length n = 15 bits.
</t>
 
        <t>Overall, these figures suggest that the length p of the common prefix 
        can be 29 bits for a /56 delegated prefix, or 21 bits if /48 delegated
        prefixes need to be allocated.</t>

      <section anchor="diffs" title="Relevant Differences from Basic 6rd">

        <t>A number of the points in <xref target="RFC5969"/> apply, with the 
        simple substitution of the Gateway for the 6rd CE.  When it comes to
        configuration, the definition of IPv4MaskLen changes, and there are 
        other differences as indicated in the previous section.  Since special
        configuration of customer equipment is not required, the 6rd DHCPv6 
        option is inapplicable.</t>

        <t>Since the link for the customer site to the network now extends only 
        as far as the Gateway, Neighbor Unreachability Detection on the part of
        customer devices is similarly limited in scope.</t>
