    <abstract>
      <t>In some scenarios, MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) pseudowires (PWs)
      (RFC 5921) may be statically configured when a dynamic control plane is
      not available. A fast protection mechanism for MPLS-TP PWs is needed to
      protect against the failure of an Attachment Circuit (AC), the failure
      of a Provider Edge (PE), or a failure in the Packet Switched Network
      (PSN). The framework and typical scenarios of dual-homing PW local
      protection are described in RFC 8184. This document proposes
      a dual-homing coordination mechanism for MPLS-TP PWs that is used for
      state exchange and switchover coordination between the dual-homing PEs
      for dual-homing PW local protection.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t><xref target="RFC6372"/>, <xref target="RFC6378"/>, and <xref
      target="RFC7771"/> describe the framework and mechanism of MPLS
      Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) linear protection, which can provide
      protection for the MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) and pseudowires (PWs)
      between the edge nodes. These mechanisms cannot protect against the failure of
      the Attachment Circuit (AC) or the edge nodes. <xref target="RFC6718"/>
      and <xref target="RFC6870"/> specify the PW redundancy framework and
      mechanism for protecting the AC or edge node against failure by adding one or
      more edge nodes, but it requires PW switchover in case of an AC failure;
      also, PW redundancy relies on Packet Switched Network (PSN) protection
      mechanisms to protect against the failure of PW.</t>

      <t>In some scenarios such as mobile backhauling, the MPLS PWs are
      provisioned with dual-homing topology in which at least the Customer
      Edge (CE) node on
      one side is dual-homed to two Provider Edge (PE) nodes. If a failure
      occurs in the primary AC, operators usually prefer to perform local
      switchover in the dual-homing PE side and keep the working pseudowire
      unchanged, if possible. 

This is to avoid massive PW switchover in the mobile backhaul network due to
AC failure in the mobile core site; such massive PW switchover may in turn
lead to congestion caused by migrating traffic away from the preferred paths
of network planners.

Similarly, as multiple PWs share the physical AC in the
mobile core site, it is preferable to keep using the working AC when
one working PW fails in the PSN to potentially avoid unnecessary
switchover for other PWs. To meet the above requirements, a fast dual-homing PW
protection mechanism is needed to protect against failure in the AC, the PE node, and the PSN.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC8184"/>
      describes a framework and several scenarios of dual-homing PW local
      protection. This document proposes a dual-homing coordination mechanism for static
   MPLS-TP PWs; the mechanism is used for information exchange and switchover
   coordination between the dual-homing PEs for the dual-homing PW local
   protection. The proposed mechanism has been implemented and
      deployed in several mobile backhaul networks that use static MPLS-TP
      PWs for the backhauling of mobile traffic from the radio access sites to
      the core site.</t>

    <section title="Overview of the Proposed Solution ">
      <t>Linear protection mechanisms for the MPLS-TP network are defined in <xref
      target="RFC6378"/>, <xref target="RFC7271"/>, and <xref
      target="RFC7324"/>. When such mechanisms are applied to PW linear
      protection <xref target="RFC7771"/>, both the working PW and the
      protection PW are terminated on the same PE node. In order to provide
      dual-homing protection for MPLS-TP PWs, some additional mechanisms are
      needed.</t>

      <t>In MPLS-TP PW dual-homing protection, the linear protection mechanism
      (as defined in <xref target="RFC6378"/>, <xref target="RFC7271"/>, and
      <xref target="RFC7324"/>) on the single-homing PE (e.g., PE3 in <xref target="figure_1"/>)
      is not changed, while on the dual-homing side, the working PW and
      protection PW are terminated on two dual-homing PEs (e.g., PE1 and PE2 in
      <xref target="figure_1"/>), respectively, to protect against a failure occurring in a PE or a
      connected AC. As described in <xref
      target="RFC8184"/>, a dedicated
      Dual-Node Interconnection (DNI) PW is used between the two dual-homing
      PE nodes to forward the traffic. In order to utilize the linear
      protection mechanism <xref target="RFC7771"/> in the dual-homing PEs
      scenario, coordination between the dual-homing PE nodes is needed so
      that the dual-homing PEs can switch the connection between the AC, the
      service PW, and the DNI-PW properly in a coordinated fashion by the
      forwarder.</t>

      <t>In order to achieve dual-homing MPLS-TP PW protection,
      coordination between the dual-homing PE nodes is needed to exchange the
      PW status and protection coordination requests.</t>

      <section title="Information Exchange Between Dual-Homing PEs" anchor="info_exchange">
        <t>The coordination information will be sent on the DNI-PW over the
        Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) as described in <xref
        target="RFC5586"/>. A new G-ACh channel type is defined for the
        dual-homing coordination between the dual-homing PEs of MPLS-TP PWs.
        This channel type can be used for the exchange of different types of
        information between the dual-homing PEs. This document uses this
        channel type for the exchange of PW status and switchover coordination
        between the dual-homing PEs. Other potential usages of this channel
        type are for further study and are out of the scope of this
        document.</t>

        <t>The MPLS-TP Dual-Homing Coordination (DHC) message is sent on the
        DNI-PW between the dual-homing PEs. The format of the MPLS-TP DHC
        message is shown below:</t>

        LSR ID of the sending PE.</t>

        <t>The DNI-PW ID field contains the 32-bit PW-ID <xref
        target="RFC8077"/> of the DNI-PW.</t>

        <t>The Flags field contains 32-bit flags, in which:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The P (Protection) bit indicates whether the Source Dual-Homing
	    PE is the working PE (P=0) or the protection PE (P=1).</t>

            <t>The S (PW Switching) bit indicates which service PW is used for
            forwarding traffic. It is set to 0 when traffic will be
            transported on the working PW, and it is set to 1 if traffic will be
            transported on the protection PW. The value of the S bit is
            determined by the protection coordination mechanism between the
            dual-homing PEs and the remote PE.</t>

            <t>Other bits are reserved for future use, which MUST be set to 0
            on transmission and MUST be ignored upon receipt.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>When a change of service PW status is detected by one of the
        dual-homing PEs, it MUST be reflected in the PW Status TLV and sent to
        the other dual-homing PE as quickly as possible to allow for fast
        protection switching using three consecutive DHC messages. This set of
        three messages allows for fast protection switching even if one or two
        of these packets are lost or corrupted. After the transmission of the
        three rapid messages, the dual-homing PE MUST send the most recently
        transmitted service PW status periodically to the other dual-homing PE
        on a continual basis using the DHC message.</t>

        <t>When one dual-homing PE determines that the active service PW needs
        to be switched from the working PW to the protection PW, it MUST send
        the Dual-Node Switching TLV to the other dual-homing PE as quickly as
        possible to allow for fast protection switching using three consecutive
        DHC messages. After the transmission of the three messages, the
        protection PW would become the active service PW, and the dual-homing
        PE MUST send the most recently transmitted Dual-Node Switching TLV
        periodically to the other dual-homing PE on a continual basis using
        the DHC message.</t>

        <t>It is RECOMMENDED that the default interval of the first three
        rapid DHC messages be 3.3 ms, similar to <xref target="RFC6378"/>, and
        the default interval of the subsequent messages is 1 second. Both the
        default interval of the three consecutive messages as well as the
        default interval of the periodic messages SHALL be configurable by
        the operator.</t>

      <section title="Protection Procedures">
        <t>The dual-homing MPLS-TP PW protection mechanism can be deployed
        with the existing AC redundancy mechanisms. On the PSN side, a 
        PSN tunnel protection mechanism is not required, as the dual-homing PW
        protection can also protect if a failure occurs in the PSN.</t>

        <t>This section uses the one-side dual-homing scenario as an example
        to describe the dual-homing PW protection procedures; the procedures
        for a two-side dual-homing scenario would be similar.</t>

        <t>On the dual-homing PE side, the role of working and protection PE
        are set by the management system or local configuration. The service
        PW connecting to the working PE is the working PW, and the service PW
        connecting to the protection PE is called the protection PW.</t>

        <t>On the single-homing PE side, it treats the working PW and
        protection PW as if they terminate on the same remote PE node, thus
        normal MPLS-TP protection coordination procedures still apply on the
        single-homing PE.</t>

        <t>The forwarding behavior of the dual-homing PEs is determined by the
        components shown in the figure below:

        <t>In <xref target="figure_5"/>, for each dual-homing PE, the service PW is the PW used
        to carry service between the dual-homing PE and the remote PE. The
        state of the service PW is determined by the Operation, Administration,
        and Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms between the dual-homing PEs and the
        remote PE.</t>

        <t>The DNI-PW is provisioned between the two dual-homing PE nodes. It
        is used to bridge traffic when a failure occurs in the PSN or
        in the ACs. The state of the DNI-PW is determined by the OAM mechanism
        between the dual-homing PEs. Since the DNI-PW is used to carry both
        the DHC messages and the service traffic during protection switching,
        it is important to ensure the robustness of the DNI-PW. In order to
        avoid the DNI-PW failure due to the failure of a particular link, it
        is RECOMMENDED that multiple diverse links be deployed between the
        dual-homing PEs and the underlying Label Switched Path (LSP) protection
	mechanism SHOULD be enabled.
</t>

        <t>The AC is the link that connects a dual-homing PE to the
        dual-homed CE. The status of AC is determined by the existing AC
        redundancy mechanisms; this is out of the scope of this document.</t>

        <t>In order to perform dual-homing PW local protection, the service PW
        status and Dual-Node Switching coordination requests are exchanged
        between the dual-homing PEs using the DHC message defined in <xref target="info_exchange"/>.</t>

        <t>Whenever a change of service PW status is detected by a dual-homing
        PE, it MUST be reflected in the PW Status TLV and sent to the other
        dual-homing PE immediately using the three consecutive DHC messages. After
        the transmission of the three rapid messages, the dual-homing PE MUST
        send the most recently transmitted service PW status periodically to
        the other dual-homing PE on a continual basis using the DHC message.
        This way, both dual-homing PEs have the status of the working and
        protection PW consistently.</t>

        <t>When there is a switchover request either generated locally or
        received on the protection PW from the remote PE, based on the status
        of the working and protection service PW along with the local and
        remote request of the protection coordination between the dual-homing
        PEs and the remote PE, the active/standby state of the service PW can
        be determined by the dual-homing PEs. As the remote protection
        coordination request is transmitted over the protection path, in this
        case the active/standby status of the service PW is determined by the
        protection PE in the dual-homing group.</t>

        <t>If it is determined on one dual-homing PE that switchover of the 
        service PW is needed, this dual-homing PE MUST set the S bit in the
        Dual-Node Switching TLV and send it to the other dual-homing PE
        immediately using the three consecutive DHC messages. With the
	exchange of service PW status and the switching request, both dual-homing PEs are
        consistent on the active/standby forwarding status of the working and
        protection service PWs. The status of the DNI-PW is determined by PW
        OAM mechanism as defined in <xref target="RFC5085"/>, and the status
        of ACs is determined by existing AC redundancy mechanisms: both are
        out of the scope of this document. The forwarding behavior on the
        dual-homing PE nodes is determined by the forwarding state machine as
        shown in Table 1.</t>

        <t>Using the topology in <xref target="figure_5"/> as an example, in normal state, the
        working PW (PW1) is in active state, the protection PW (PW2) is in
        standby state, the DNI-PW is up, and AC1 is in active state according
        to the AC redundancy mechanism. According to the forwarding state
        machine in Table 1, traffic will be forwarded through the working PW
        (PW1) and the primary AC (AC1). No traffic will go through the
        protection PE (PE2) or the DNI-PW, as both the protection PW (PW2) and
        the AC connecting to PE2 are in standby state.</t>

        <t>If a failure occurs in AC1, the state of AC2 changes to active
        according to the AC redundancy mechanism, while there is no change in
        the state of the working and protection PWs. According to the
        forwarding state machine in Table 1, PE1 starts to forward traffic
        between the working PW and the DNI-PW, and PE2 starts to forward
        traffic between AC2 and the DNI-PW. It should be noted that in this
        case only AC switchover takes place; in the PSN, traffic is
        still forwarded using the working PW.</t>

        <t>If a failure in the PSN brings PW1 down, the failure can be
        detected by PE1 or PE3 using existing OAM mechanisms. If PE1 detects
        the failure of PW1, it MUST inform PE2 of the state of the working PW using
        the PW Status TLV in the DHC messages and change the forwarding status
        of PW1 to standby. On receipt of the DHC message, PE2 SHOULD change
        the forwarding status of PW2 to active. Then, according to the
        forwarding state machine in Table 1, PE1 SHOULD set up the connection
        between the DNI-PW and AC1, and PE2 SHOULD set up the connection
        between PW2 and the DNI-PW. According to the linear protection
        mechanism <xref target="RFC6378"/>, PE2 also sends an appropriate
        protection coordination message <xref target="RFC6378"/> over the
        protection PW (PW2) to PE3 for the remote side to switchover from PW1
        to PW2. If PE3 detects the failure of PW1, according to the linear
        protection mechanism <xref target="RFC6378"/>, it sends a protection
        coordination message on the protection PW (PW2) to inform PE2 of the
        failure on the working PW. Upon receipt of the message, PE2 SHOULD
        change the forwarding status of PW2 to active and set up the
        connection according to the forwarding state machine in Table 1. PE2
        SHOULD send a DHC message to PE1 with the S bit set in the Dual-Node
        Switching TLV to coordinate the switchover on PE1 and PE2. This is
        useful for a unidirectional failure that cannot be detected by
        PE1.</t>

        <t>If a failure brings the working PE (PE1) down, the failure can be
        detected by both PE2 and PE3 using existing OAM mechanisms. Both PE2
        and PE3 SHOULD change the forwarding status of PW2 to active and send
        a protection coordination message <xref target="RFC6378"/> on the
        protection PW (PW2) to inform the remote side to switchover. According
        to the existing AC redundancy mechanisms, the status of AC1 changes to
        standby and the state of AC2 changes to active. According to the
        forwarding state machine in Table 1, PE2 starts to forward traffic
        between the PW2 and AC2.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>MPLS-TP is a subset of MPLS and so builds upon many of the aspects of
      the MPLS security model. Please refer to <xref target="RFC5920"/> for
      generic MPLS security issues and methods for securing traffic privacy
      and integrity.</t>

      <t>The DHC message defined in this document contains control
      information. If it is injected or modified by an attacker, the
      dual-homing PEs might not agree on which PE should be used to deliver
      the CE traffic, and this could be used as a denial-of-service attack
      against the CE. It is important that the DHC message be used within a
      trusted MPLS-TP network domain as described in <xref
      target="RFC6941"/>.</t>

      <t>The DHC message is carried in the G-ACh <xref target="RFC5586"/>, so
      it is dependent on the security of the G-ACh itself. The G-ACh is a
      generalization of the Associated Channel defined in <xref
      target="RFC4385"/>. Thus, this document relies on the security
      mechanisms provided for the Associated Channel as described in those two
      documents.</t>

      <t>As described in the Security Considerations section of <xref
      target="RFC6378"/>, the G-ACh is essentially connection oriented, so
      injection or modification of control messages requires the subversion of
      a transit node. Such subversion is generally considered hard in
      connection-oriented MPLS networks and impossible to protect against at
      the protocol level. Management-level techniques are more appropriate.
      The procedures and protocol extensions defined in this document do not
      affect the security model of MPLS-TP linear protection as defined in
      <xref target="RFC6378"/>.</t>

      <t>Uniqueness of the identifiers defined in this document is guaranteed
      by the assigner (e.g., the operator). Failure by an assigner to use
      unique values within the specified scoping for any of the identifiers
      defined herein could result in operational problems. Please refer to
      <xref target="RFC6370"/> for more details about the uniqueness of the
      identifiers.</t>
