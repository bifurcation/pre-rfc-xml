    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        It is commonly recognized that the Internet routing and addressing
        architecture is facing challenges in inter-domain scalability,
        mobility, multi-homing, and inter-domain traffic engineering
        <xref target='RFC4984'/>.  The Routing Research Group (RRG) aims to
        design an alternate architecture to meet these challenges.  This
        document presents a prioritized list of design goals for the target
        architecture.
      </t>

      <t>
        These goals should be taken as guidelines for the design and
        evaluation of possible architectural solutions.  The expectation is
        that these goals will be applied with good judgment.
      </t>
      <t>
        The goals presented here were initially presented and discussed at
        the start of the RRG work on a revised routing architecture, and
        were revisited and finalized after the work on that architecture
        was complete.  As such, this represents both the goals that the RRG
        started with, and revisions to those goals based on our increased
        understanding of the space.

    <section title="Design Goals for a New Routing Architecture">

      <section title="Improved Routing Scalability">
        <t>
          Long experience with inter-domain routing has shown that the
          global BGP routing table is continuing to grow rapidly
          <xref target="BGPGrowth"/>.  Carrying this large amount of state
          in the inter-domain routing protocols is expensive and places
          undue cost burdens on network participants that do not
          necessarily get value from the increases in the routing table
          size.  Thus, the first required goal is to provide significant
          improvement to the scalability of the inter-domain routing
          subsystem.  It is strongly desired to make the routing subsystem
          scale independently from the growth of the Internet user
          population.  If there is a coupling between the size of the user
          base and the scale of the routing subsystem, then it will be very
          difficult to retain any semblance of scalability.  If a solution
          includes support for alternative routes to support faster
          convergence, the alternative routes should also factor into
          routing subsystem scalability.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Scalable Support for Traffic Engineering">
        <t>
          Traffic engineering is the capability of directing traffic along
          paths other than those that would be computed by normal IGP/EGP
          routing.  Inter-domain traffic engineering today is frequently
          accomplished by injecting more-specific prefixes into the global
          routing table, which results in a negative impact on routing
          scalability.  The additional prefixes injected to enable traffic
          engineering place an added burden on the scalability of the routing
          architecture.  At the same time, the need for traffic engineering
          capabilities is essential to network operations.  Thus, a
          scalable solution for inter-domain traffic engineering is
          strongly desired.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Scalable Support for Multi-Homing">
        <t>
         Multi-homing is the capability of an organization to be connected
         to the Internet via more than one other organization.  The
         current mechanism for supporting multi-homing is to let the
         organization advertise one prefix or multiple prefixes into the global
         routing system, again resulting in a negative impact on routing
         scalability. More scalable solutions for multi-homing are
         strongly desired.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Decoupling Location and Identification">
        <t>
          Numerous sources have noted that an IP address embodies both
          host attachment point information and identification information
          <xref target='IEN1'/>.  This overloading has caused numerous
          semantic collisions that have limited the flexibility of the
          Internet architecture.  Therefore, it is desired that a solution
          separate the host location information namespace from the
          identification namespace.
        </t>

        <t>
          Caution must be taken here to clearly distinguish the decoupling of
          host location and identification information, and the decoupling of
          end-site addresses from globally routable prefixes; the latter has
          been proposed as one of the approaches to a scalable routing
          architecture.  Solutions to both problems, i.e., (1) the decoupling
          of host location and identification information and (2) a scalable
          global routing system (whose solution may, or may not, depend on
          the second decoupling) are required, and it is required that their
          solutions are compatible with each other.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Scalable Support for Mobility">
        <t>
          Mobility is the capability of a host, network, or organization to
          change its topological connectivity with respect to the remainder
          of the Internet, while continuing to receive packets from the
          Internet.  Existing mechanisms to provide mobility support
          include 
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>
              renumbering the mobile entity as it changes its topological
              attachment point(s) to the Internet;
            </t>
            <t>
              renumbering and creating a tunnel from the entity's new
              topological location back to its original location; and
            </t>
            <t>
              letting the mobile entity announce its prefixes from its new
              attachment point(s).
            </t>
            </list>
          The first approach alone is considered unsatisfactory, as the
          change of IP address may break existing transport or higher-level
          connections for those protocols using IP addresses as
          identifiers.  The second requires the deployment of a 'home
          agent' to keep track of the mobile entity's current location and
          adds overhead to the routers involved, as well as adding stretch
          to the path of an inbound packet.  Neither of the first two
          approaches impacts the routing scalability.  The third approach,
          however, injects dynamic updates into the global routing system
          as the mobile entity moves.  Mechanisms that help to provide more
          efficient and scalable mobility support are desired, especially
          when they can be coupled with security -- especially privacy -- and
          support topological changes at a high rate.  Ideally, such
          mechanisms should completely decouple mobility from routing.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Simplified Renumbering">
        <t>
          Today, many of the end-sites receive their IP address assignments
          from their Internet Service Providers (ISPs).  When such a site
          changes providers, for routing to scale, the site must renumber
          into a new address block assigned by its new ISP.  This can be
          costly, error-prone, and painful <xref target='RFC5887'/>.
          Automated tools, once developed, are expected to provide
          significant help in reducing the renumbering pain.  It is not
          expected that renumbering will be wholly automated, as some
          manual reconfiguration is likely to be necessary for changing the
          last-mile link.  However, the overall cost of renumbering
          should be drastically lowered.
        </t>
        
        <t>
          In addition to being configured into hosts and routers, where
          automated renumbering tools can help, IP addresses are also often
          used for other purposes, such as access control lists. They are
          also sometimes hard-coded into applications used in environments
          where failure of the DNS could be catastrophic (e.g., certain
          remote monitoring applications).  Although renumbering may be
          considered a mild inconvenience for some sites, and guidelines
          have been developed for renumbering a network without a flag day
          <xref target="RFC4192"/>, for others, the necessary changes are
          sufficiently difficult so as to make renumbering effectively
          impossible.  It is strongly desired that a new architecture allow
          end-sites to renumber their network with significantly less
          disruption, or, if renumbering can be eliminated, the new
          architecture must demonstrate how the topology can be
          economically morphed to fit the addressing.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Modularity, Composability, and Seamlessness">
        <t>
          A new routing architecture should be modular: it should subdivide
          into multiple composable, extensible, and orthogonal subsystems.
          The interfaces between modules should be natural and seamless,
          without special cases or restrictions.  Similarly, the primitives
          and abstractions in the architecture should be suitably general,
          with operations equally applicable to abstractions and concrete
          entities, and without deleterious side-effects that might hinder
          communication between endpoints in the Internet.  These
          properties are strongly desired in a solution.
        </t>
        <t>
          As an example, if tunneling were used as a part of a solution,
          tunneling should be completely transparent to both of the
          endpoints, without requiring new mechanisms for determining the
          correct maximum datagram size.
        </t>
        <t>
          The resulting network should always fully approximate the current
          best-effort Internet connectivity model, and it should also
          anticipate changes to that model, e.g., for multiple differentiated
          and/or guaranteed levels of service in the future.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Routing Quality">
        <t>
          The routing subsystem is responsible for computing a path from
          any point in the Internet to any other point in the Internet.
          The quality of the routes that are computed can be measured by a
          number of metrics, such as convergence, stability, and stretch.  

          <list><t>
              The stretch factor is the maximum ratio between the length of a
              route computed by the routing scheme and that of a shortest path
              connecting the same pair of nodes <xref target="JACM89"/>.
          </t>
          </list>

          A solution is strongly desired to provide routing quality
          equivalent to what is available today, or better.

        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Routing Security">
        <t>
          Currently, the routing subsystem is secured through a number of
          protocol-specific mechanisms of varying strength and
          applicability.  Any new architecture is required to provide at
          least the same level of security as is deployed as of when the
          new architecture is deployed.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Deployability">
        <t>
          A viable solution is required to be deployable from a technical
          perspective. Furthermore, given the extensive deployed base of
          today's Internet, a solution is required to be incrementally
          deployable.  This implies that a solution must continue to
          support those functions in today's routing subsystem that are
          actually used.  This includes, but is not limited to, the ability
          to control routing based on policy.
        </t>
