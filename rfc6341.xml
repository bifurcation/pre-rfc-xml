    <abstract>
       <t>Session recording is a critical requirement in many business
          communications environments, such as call centers and financial
          trading floors.  In some of these environments, all calls must be
          recorded for regulatory and compliance reasons.  In others, calls may
          be recorded for quality control or business analytics.</t>
        
       <t>Recording is typically performed by sending a copy of the session media 
          to the recording devices.  This document specifies requirements for 
          extensions to SIP that will manage delivery of RTP media to a recording device.  
          This is being referred to as SIP-based Media Recording.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
        <t>Session recording is a critical operational requirement in many
        businesses, especially where voice is used as a medium for commerce
        and customer support.  A prime example where voice is used for trade
        is the financial industry.  The call recording requirements in this
        industry are quite stringent.  The recorded calls are used for
        dispute resolution and compliance.  Other businesses, such as customer
        support call centers, typically employ call recording for quality
        control or business analytics, with different requirements.</t>
    
        <t>Depending on the country and its regulatory requirements, financial
        trading floors typically must record all calls.  In contrast, call centers typically only
        record a subset of the calls, and calls must not fail, regardless of
        the availability of the recording device.</t>
        
        <t>Respecting the privacy rights and wishes of users engaged in a call
        is of paramount importance. In many jurisdictions, participants have a right to 
        know that the session is being recorded or might be recorded, and they have a 
        right to opt out, either by terminating the call or by demanding that the 
        call not be recorded. Therefore, this document contains requirements for being 
       able to notify users that a call is being recorded and for users to be able 
       to request that a call not be recorded.
       
       Use cases where users participating in a call are not informed that the 
       call is or might be recorded are outside the scope of this document. 
       In particular, lawful intercept is outside the scope of this document.
        </t>
        
         <t>Furthermore, a one-size-fits-all model will not fit all markets where the 
            scale and cost burdens vary widely and where needs differ for such
            solution capabilities as media injection, transcoding, and security. If a standardized solution
            supports all of the requirements from every recording market but
            doing so would be expensive for markets with lesser needs, then
            proprietary solutions for those markets will continue to propagate.
            Care must be taken, therefore, to make a standards-based solution
            support optionality and flexibility.</t>
           
           <t>This document specifies requirements for using SIP <xref target="RFC3261"/> between a 
            Session Recording Client and a Session Recording Server to control the 
            recording of media that has been transmitted in the context of a Communication Session.
           
            A Communication Session is the "call" between participants. 
            The Session Recording Client is the source of the recorded media. The Session Recording Server is the sink of
            recorded media. It should be noted that the requirements for the protocol between a
            Session Recording Server and Session Recording Client have very similar requirements
            (such as codec and transport negotiation, encryption key interchange,
            and firewall traversal) as compared to regular SIP media sessions.  The
            choice of SIP for session recording provides reuse of an existing
            protocol.  </t>
           
           <t>The recorded sessions can be any RTP media sessions,
          including voice, dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF)
          (as defined by <xref target="RFC4733" />),
          video, and text (as defined by <xref target="RFC4103" />).</t>
           
           <t>An archived session recording is typically comprised of the Communication Session media content and 
            the Communication Session Metadata.  The Communication Session Metadata allows recording archives to be searched and
            filtered at a later time and allows a session to be played back in a meaningful way, 
            e.g., with correct synchronization between the media. 
           
            The Communication Session Metadata needs to be conveyed from the Session Recording Client 
            to the Session Recording Server.</t>
           
           <t>This document only considers active recording, where the Session Recording
            Client purposefully streams media to a Session Recording Server.  Passive
            recording, where a recording device detects media directly from the
            network, is outside the scope of this document.</t>

        <t hangText="Session Recording Server (SRS):"> A Session Recording Server (SRS) is a SIP User Agent (UA) that is a 
        specialized media server or collector that acts as the sink of the recorded media.  
        An SRS is typically implemented as a multi-port device that is capable
        of receiving media from multiple sources simultaneously.  
        An SRS is the sink of the recorded session metadata.

        <t hangText="Session Recording Client (SRC):"> A Session Recording Client (SRC) is a SIP User Agent

        physical devices.  In practice, an SRC could be a personal device
        (such as a SIP phone), a SIP Media Gateway (MG), a Session Border
        Controller (SBC), or a SIP Media Server (MS) integrated with an
        Application Server (AS).  This specification defines the term "SRC" such
        that all such SIP entities can be generically addressed under one
        definition.  The SRC provides metadata to the SRS.</t>

        recording silence during such periods, or by not recording such periods but
        marking them by means of metadata for utilization on playback, etc.).

        Applications include financial trading desks and emergency (first-responder) service
        bureaus. The length of a Persistent Recording Session is

    <section title="Privacy Considerations">
       <t>Respecting the privacy rights and wishes of users engaged in a call
        is of paramount importance. In many jurisdictions, participants have a right to 
        know that the session is being recorded or might be recorded, and they have a 
        right to opt out, either by terminating the call or by demanding that the 
        call not be recorded. Therefore, this document contains requirements for being 
       able to notify users that a call is being recorded and for users to be able 
       to request that a call not be recorded.
       
       Use cases where users participating in a call are not informed that the 
       call is or might be recorded are outside the scope of this document. 
       In particular, lawful intercept is outside the scope of this document.</t>
      
       
       <t>
       Requirements for participant notification of recording 
       vary widely by jurisdiction. In a given deployment, not all users will be 
       authorized to stop the recording 
        of a CS (although any user can terminate its participation in a CS). Typically, users within the 
        domain that is carrying out the recording will be subject to policies of 
        that domain concerning whether CSs are recorded. For example, in a call center, 
        agents will be subject to policies of the call center and may or may not have 
        the right to prevent the recording of a CS or part of a CS. Users calling into 
        the call center, on the other hand, will typically have to ask the agent not 
        to record the CS. If the agent is unable to prevent recording, or if the caller 
        does not trust the agent, the only option generally is to terminate the CS.</t>

        <t>Privacy considerations also extend to what happens to a recording once it 
        has been created. Typical issues are who can access the recording (e.g., 
        receive a copy of the recording, view the metadata, play back the media, etc.), 
        for what purpose the recording can be used (e.g., for training purposes, 
        for quality control purposes, etc.), and for how long the 
        recording is to be retained before deletion. These are typically policies of 
        the domain that makes the recording, rather than policies of individual users 
        involved in a recorded CS, whether those users be in the same domain or in a 
        different domain. Taking the call center example again, agents might be made 
        aware of call center policy regarding retention and use of recordings as part 
        of their employment contract, and callers from outside the call center might 
        be given some information about policy when notified that a CS will be recorded 
        (e.g., through an announcement that says that calls may be recorded  for quality purposes).</t>
        
        <t>This document does not specify any requirements for a user engaged in
        a CS to be able to dictate policy for what happens to a recording, or
        for such information to be conveyed from an SRC to an SRS. It is
        assumed that the SRS has access to policy applicable to its
        environment and can ensure that recordings are stored and used in
        accordance with that policy.

    <section title="Security Considerations">
       <t>Session recording has substantial security implications, for the
       SIP UAs being recorded, the SRC, and the SRS.</t>
           
       <t>For the SIP UAs involved in the Communication Session, the requirements
       in this document enable the UA to identify that a Communication Session is being
       recorded and to request that a given Communication Session not be
       subject to recording.</t>
    
       <t>Since humans don't typically look at or know about protocol signaling
       such as SIP, and indeed the SIP session might have originated through
       a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) gateway without any ability to pass on in-signaling
       indications of recording, users can be notified of recording in the
       media itself through voice announcements, a visual indicator on
       the endpoint, or other means.</t>
    
       <t>With regard to security implications of the protocol(s), clearly
       there is a need for authentication, authorization, and eavesdropping protection 
           for the solution. The SRC needs to know the SRS it is communicating with is legitimate,
           and vice versa, even if they are in different domains. Both the signaling and media for 
           the Recording Session need the ability to be authenticated and protected from
       eavesdropping. Requirements are detailed in <xref target="reqs" />.</t>

       <t>Communication Sessions and Recording Sessions can require different security levels 
           both for signaling and media, depending on deployment configurations. For some environments, 
           e.g., the SRS and SRC will be collocated in a secure network region, and therefore the RS 
           will not require the same protection level as a CS that extends
           over a public network, for example. For other environments, the SRS can be located in a public cloud, for example, 
           and the RS will require a higher protection level than the CS. For these reasons, there 
           is not a direct relationship between the security level of Communication Sessions and 
           the security level of Recording Sessions.</t>
           
           <t>A malicious or corrupt SRC can tamper with media and metadata relating to a CS 
           before sending the data to an SRS. Also, CS media and signaling can be tampered with in the 
           network prior to reaching an SRC, unless proper means are provided to ensure 
           integrity protection during transmission on the CS. Means for ensuring the 
           correctness of media and metadata emitted by an SRC are outside 
           the scope of this work. Other organizational and technical controls will need 
           to be used to prevent tampering.</t>
