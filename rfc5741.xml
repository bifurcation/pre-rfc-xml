    <abstract>
      <t>
	RFC documents contain a number of fixed elements such as the
	title page header, standard boilerplates, and copyright/IPR
	statements.  This document describes them and introduces some
	updates to reflect current usage and requirements of RFC
	publication.  In particular, this updated structure is
	intended to communicate clearly the source of RFC creation and
	review.

   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>
        Previously, RFCs (e.g., <xref target="RFC4844" />) contained a
        number of elements that were there for historical, practical,
        and legal reasons. They also contained boilerplate material to
        clearly indicate the status of the document and possibly
        contained "Notes" to indicate how the document interacts with
        IETF Standards Track documents.
       
     </t>
     <t>
	As the RFC Series has evolved over the years, there has been
	increasing concern over appropriate labeling of the
	publications to make clear the status of each RFC and the
	status of the work it describes.  Chiefly, there is a
	requirement that RFCs published as part of the IETF's review
	process not be easily confused with RFCs that may have had a
	very different review and approval process.  Various
	adjustments have been made over the years, including evolving
	text of "Notes" included in the published RFC.
     </t>
     <t>
	With the definition of the different RFC streams <xref
	target="RFC4844"/>, it is appropriate to formalize the
	definition of the various pieces of standard RFC boilerplate
	and introduce some adjustments to ensure better clarity of
	expression of document status, aligned with the review and
	approval processes defined for each stream.
     </t>

     <t>
	This memo identifies and describes the common elements of RFC
	boilerplate structure, and provides a comprehensive approach
	to updating and using those elements to communicate, with
	clarity, RFC document and content status.  Most of the
	historical structure information is collected from <xref
	target="RFC2223"/>.
     </t>
	
     <t>
	The changes introduced by this memo should be implemented as
	soon as practically possible after the document has been
	approved for publication.
     </t>

   <section anchor="standards" title="RFC Streams and Internet Standards">
     <t>
	Users of RFCs should be aware that while all Internet
	Standards-related documents are published as RFCs, not all
	RFCs are Internet Standards-related documents.
     </t>

     <t>
	The IETF is responsible for maintaining the Internet Standards
	Process, which includes the requirements for developing,
	reviewing, and approving Standards Track and BCP RFCs. The
        IETF also produces non-Standards-Track documents (Informational, 
        Experimental, and Historic).  All documents published as part of
        the IETF Stream are reviewed by the appropriate IETF bodies.
     </t>
     <t>
	Documents published in streams other than the IETF Stream are
	not generally reviewed by the IETF for such things as security,
	congestion control, or inappropriate interaction with deployed
	protocols.  They have also not been subject to approval by the
	Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), including an
	IETF-wide last call.  Therefore, the IETF disclaims, for any
	of the non-IETF Stream documents, any knowledge of the fitness
	of those RFCs for any purpose.
     </t>

     <t>
	Refer to <xref target="RFC2026"/>, <xref
	target="RFC5742"/>, and <xref target="RFC4844"/> and their
	successors for current details of the IETF process and RFC
	streams.

   <section title="RFC Structural Elements">
     <section title="The Title Page Header">
       <t>
	 This section describes the elements that are commonly found
	 in RFCs published today.  For the sake of clarity, this
	 document specifies the elements precisely as a specification.
	 However, this is not intended to specify a single, static
	 format.  Details of formatting are decided by the RFC Editor.
	 Substantive changes to the header and boilerplate structure
	 and content may be undertaken in the future, and are subject
	 to general oversight and review by the IAB.
       </t>


	<t>
	  An RFC title page header can be described as follows:
	  <figure>
<artwork>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;document source&gt;                                          &lt;author name&gt;
Request for Comments: &lt;RFC number&gt;                [&lt;author affiliation&gt;]
[&lt;subseries ID&gt; &lt;subseries number&gt;]    [more author info as appropriate]
[&lt;RFC relation&gt;:&lt;RFC number[s]&gt;]        
Category: &lt;category&gt;
                                                            &lt;month year&gt;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
	    </artwork>
	  </figure>
	  For example, a sample earlier RFC header is as follows:
	  <figure>
<artwork>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Network Working Group                                          T. Dierks

	<t> 
	  The right column contains author name and affiliation
	  information as well as the RFC publication month.  Conventions
	  and restrictions for these elements are described in RFC
	  style norms and some individual stream definitions.
	</t>
	<t>
	  This section is primarily concerned with the information in
	  the left column:
	</t>
	<t>
	  <list style="hanging">
	    
	    <t hangText="&lt;document source&gt;"> 
	      This describes the area where the work originates.
	      Historically, all RFCs were labeled Network Working
	      Group. "Network Working Group" refers to the original
	      version of today's IETF when people from the original
	      set of ARPANET sites and whomever else was interested --
	      the meetings were open -- got together to discuss,
	      design, and document proposed protocols <xref
	      target='RFC0003'/>. Here, we obsolete the term "Network
	      Working Group" in order to indicate the originating
	      stream.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The &lt;document source&gt; is the name of the RFC
	      stream, as defined in <xref target="RFC4844"/> and its
	      successors.  At the time of this publication, the
	      streams, and therefore the possible entries are:
	      <list style='symbols'>
		<t>Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</t> 
		<t>Internet Architecture Board (IAB)</t> 
		<t>Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)</t>
		<t>Independent Submission</t>

	      </list>

	    </t>
	    
	    <t hangText="Request for Comments: &lt;RFC number&gt;">
<vspace blankLines="0" />
	      This indicates the RFC number, assigned by the RFC
	      Editor upon publication of the document.  This element
	      is unchanged.
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="&lt;subseries ID&gt; &lt;subseries number&gt;"> 
<vspace blankLines="0" />
	      Some document categories are also labeled as a subseries
	      of RFCs.  These elements appear as appropriate for such
	      categories, indicating the subseries and the documents
	      number within that series.  Currently, there are
	      subseries for BCPs <xref target="RFC2026"/>, STDs <xref
	      target="RFC1311"/>, and FYIs <xref target="RFC1150"/>.
	      These subseries numbers may appear in several RFCs.  For
	      example, when a new RFC obsoletes or updates an old one,
	      the same subseries number is used.  Also, several RFCs
	      may be assigned the same subseries number: a single STD,
	      for example, may be composed of several RFCs, each of
	      which will bear the same STD number.  This element is
	      unchanged.
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="[&lt;RFC relation&gt;: &lt;RFC number[s]&gt;]"> 
<vspace blankLines="0" />
	      Some relations between RFCs in the series are explicitly
	      noted in the RFC header.  For example, a new RFC may
	      update one or more earlier RFCs.  Currently two
	      relationships are defined: "Updates" and "Obsoletes"
	      <xref target="RFC2223"/>. Alternatives like "Obsoleted by"
	      are also used (e.g., in <xref target="RFC5143"/>). Other
	      types of relationships may be defined by the RFC Editor
	      and may appear in future RFCs.

	    </t>
	    <t hangText="Category: &lt;category&gt;">
<vspace blankLines="0" />
	      This indicates the initial RFC document category of the
	      publication.  These are defined in <xref
	      target="RFC2026"/>.  Currently, this is always one of:
	      Standards Track, Best Current Practice, Experimental,
	      Informational, or Historic.  This element is unchanged.

	<t>
	  The "Status of This Memo" will start with a single sentence

<section title="Paragraph 1">

	  The second paragraph of the "Status of This Memo" will now
	  include a paragraph describing the type of review and

	  the RFC Editor and IAB.  There is a specific structure
	  defined here to ensure there is clarity about review

<t>The IETF policies about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), such as patent rights, relative to technologies developed in the IETF are designed to ensure that IETF working groups and participants have as much information about any IPR constraints on a technical proposal as possible.  The policies are also intended to benefit the Internet community and the public at large, while respecting the legitimate rights of IPR holders.  This memo details the IETF policies concerning IPR related to technology worked on within the IETF.  It also describes the objectives that the policies are designed to meet.  This memo updates RFC 2026 and, with RFC 3978, replaces Section 10 of RFC 2026.  This memo also updates paragraph 4 of Section 3.2 of RFC 2028, for all purposes, including reference [2] in RFC 2418.
