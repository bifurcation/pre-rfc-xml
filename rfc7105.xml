    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a protocol for a Device to provide
location-related measurement data to a Location Information Server (LIS) within
a request for location information.  Location-related measurement information
provides observations concerning properties related to the position of a
Device; this information could be data about network attachment or about the
physical environment.  A LIS is able to use the location-related measurement
data to improve the accuracy of the location estimate it provides to the
Device.  A basic set of location-related measurements are defined, including
common modes of network attachment as well as assisted Global Navigation
Satellite System (GNSS) parameters.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>A Location Configuration Protocol (LCP) provides a means for a Device
to request information about its physical location from an access network.  A
Location Information Server (LIS) is the server that provides location
information that is available due to the knowledge it has about the network and
physical environment.
      </t>

      <t>As a part of the access network, the LIS is able to acquire
measurement results related to Device location from network elements.  The LIS
also has access to information about the network topology that can be used to
turn measurement data into location information.  This information can be
further enhanced with information acquired from the Device itself.
      </t>

      <t>A Device is able to make observations about its network attachment, or
its physical environment.  The location-related measurement data might be
unavailable to the LIS; alternatively, the LIS might be able to acquire the
data, but at a higher cost in terms of time or some other metric. Providing
measurement data gives the LIS more options in determining location; this could
in turn improve the quality of the service provided by the LIS.  Improvements
in accuracy are one potential gain, but improved response times and lower error
rates are also possible.
      </t>

      <t>This document describes a means for a Device to report
location-related measurement data to the LIS.  Examples based on the <xref
target="RFC5985">HTTP&nbhy;Enabled Location Delivery (HELD)</xref> location
configuration protocol are provided.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="conventions" title="Conventions Used in This Document">
      <t>The terms <spanx style="verb">LIS</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">Device</spanx> are used in this document in a manner
consistent with the usage in <xref target="RFC5985"/>.
      </t>

      <t>This document also uses the following definitions:
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Location Measurement:">An observation about the physical
properties of a particular Device's position in time and space.  The result of
a location measurement -- "location-related measurement data", or simply
"measurement data" given sufficient context -- can be used to determine the
location of a Device.  Location-related measurement data does not directly
identify a Device, though it could do so indirectly.  Measurement data can
change with time if the location of the Device also changes.
          <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          Location-related measurement data does not necessarily contain
location information directly, but it can be used in combination with
contextual knowledge and/or algorithms to derive location information.
Examples of location-related measurement data are radio signal strength or
timing measurements, Ethernet switch identifiers, and port identifiers.
          <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          Location-related measurement data can be considered sighting
information, based on the definition in <xref target="RFC3693"/>.
          </t>

          <t hangText="Location Estimate:">An approximation of where the Device
is located.  Location estimates are derived from location measurements.
Location estimates are subject to uncertainty, which arises from errors in
measurement results.
          </t>

          <t hangText="GNSS:">Global Navigation Satellite System.  A
satellite-based system that provides positioning and time information -- for
example, the US Global Positioning System (GPS) or the European Galileo system.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Location-Related Measurements in LCPs">
      <t>This document defines a standard container for the conveyance of
location-related measurement parameters in location configuration protocols.
This is an XML container that identifies parameters by type and allows the
Device to provide the results of any measurement it is able to perform.  A set
of measurement schemas are also defined that can be carried in the generic
container.
      </t>

      <t>A simple example of measurement data conveyance is illustrated by the
example message in <xref target="ex-basic"/>.  This shows a HELD location
request message with an Ethernet switch and port measurement taken using <xref
target="IEEE.8021AB">the Link-Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP)</xref>.

      <t>This LIS can ignore measurement data that it does not support or understand.  The measurements defined in this document follow this rule: extensions that could result in backward incompatibility MUST be added as new measurement definitions rather than extensions to existing types.
      </t>

      <t>Multiple sets of measurement data, either of the same type or from
different sources, can be included in the <spanx
style="verb">measurements</spanx> element.  See <xref target="time"/> for 
details on repetition of this element.
      </t>

      <t>A LIS can choose to use or ignore location-related measurement data in determining location, as long as <xref target="privacy">rules regarding use and retention</xref> are respected.  The <spanx style="verb">method</spanx> parameter in the <xref target="RFC4119">Presence Information Data Format - Location Object (PIDF-LO)</xref> SHOULD be adjusted to reflect the method used.  A correct <spanx style="verb">method</spanx> can assist location recipients in assessing the quality (both accuracy and integrity) of location information, though there could be reasons to withhold information about the source of data.
      </t>

      <t>Measurement data is typically only used to serve the request in
which it is included.  There may be exceptions, particularly with respect to
location URIs.  <xref target="privacy"/> provides more information on usage
rules.
      </t>

      <t>Location-related measurement data need not be provided exclusively by
Devices.  A third-party location requester (for example, see <xref
target="RFC6155"/>) can request location information using measurement data, if
the requester is able to acquire measurement data and authorized to distribute
it.  There are specific privacy considerations relating to the use of
measurements by third parties, which are discussed in <xref target="thirdp"/>.
      </t>

      <t>Location-related measurement data and its use present a number of
privacy and security challenges.  These are described in more detail in
Sections <xref target="privacy" format="counter"/> and <xref target="security" format="counter"/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Location-Related Measurement Data Types">
      <t>A common container is defined for the expression of location measurement data, as well as a simple means of identifying specific types of measurement data for the purposes of requesting them.
      </t>

      <figure anchor="example" title="Measurement Example">
        <preamble>The following example shows a measurement container with measurement time and expiration time included.  A WiFi measurement is enclosed.</preamble>

      <section anchor="container" title="Measurement Container">
        <t>The <spanx style="verb">measurements</spanx> element is used to
encapsulate measurement data that is collected at a certain point in time.  It
contains time-based attributes that are common to all forms of measurement
data, and it permits the inclusion of arbitrary measurement data.  The elements
that are included within the <spanx style="verb">measurements</spanx> element
are generically referred to as "measurement elements".
        </t>

        <t>This container can be added to a request for location information in any protocol capable of carrying XML, such as a <xref target="RFC5985">HELD location request</xref>.
        </t>

        <section anchor="time" title="Time of Measurement">
          <t>The <spanx style="verb">time</spanx> attribute records the time
that the measurement or observation was made.  This time can be different from
the time that the measurement information was reported.  Time information can
be used to populate a timestamp on the location result or to determine if the
measurement information is used.
          </t>

          <t>The <spanx style="verb">time</spanx> attribute SHOULD be provided whenever possible.  This allows a LIS to avoid selecting an arbitrary timestamp.  Exceptions to this, where omitting time might make sense, include relatively static types of measurement (for instance, the DSL measurements in <xref target="dsl"/>) or for legacy Devices that don't record time information (such as the Home Location Register/Home Subscriber Server for cellular).
          </t>

          <t>The <spanx style="verb">time</spanx> attribute is attached to the
root <spanx style="verb">measurement</spanx> element.  Multiple measurements
can often be given the same timestamp, even when the measurements were not
actually taken at the same time (consider a set of measurements taken
sequentially, where the difference in time between observations is not
significant).  Measurements cannot be grouped if they have different types or
if there is a need for independent time values on each measurement.  In these
instances, multiple measurement sets are necessary.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="expires" title="Expiry Time on Location-Related Measurement Data">
          <t>A Device is able to indicate an expiry time in the location measurement using the <spanx style="verb">expires</spanx> attribute.  Nominally, this attribute indicates how long information is expected to be valid, but it can also indicate a time limit on the retention and use of the measurement data.  A Device can use this attribute to request that the LIS not retain measurement data beyond the indicated time.

          <list style="empty">
            <t>Note: Movement of the Device might result in the measurement
            data being invalidated before the expiry time.
            </t>
          </list>
          </t>

          <t>A Device is advised to set the <spanx style="verb">expires</spanx>
attribute to the earlier of the time that measurements are likely to be
unusable and the time that it desires to have measurements discarded by the
LIS.  A Device that does not desire measurement data to be retained can omit
the <spanx style="verb">expires</spanx> attribute.  <xref target="privacy"/>
describes more specific rules regarding measurement data retention.

        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="RMS Error and Number of Samples">
        <t>Often a measurement is taken more than once.  Reporting the average of a number of measurement results mitigates the effects of random errors that occur in the measurement process.
        </t>

        <t>Reporting each measurement individually can be the most effective method of reporting multiple measurements.  This is achieved by providing multiple measurement elements for different times.
        </t>

        <t>The alternative is to aggregate multiple measurements and report a mean value across the set of measurements.  Additional information about the distribution of the results can be useful in determining location uncertainty.
        </t>

        <t>Two attributes are provided for use on some measurement values:
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="rmsError:">The root-mean-squared (RMS) error of the set
of measurement values used in calculating the result.  RMS error is
expressed in the same units as the measurement, unless otherwise stated.  If an
accurate value for the RMS error is not known, this value can be used to
indicate an upper bound or estimate for the RMS error.
          </t>

          <t hangText="samples:">The number of samples that were taken in determining the measurement value.  If omitted, this value can be assumed to be large enough that the RMS error is an indication of the standard deviation of the sample set.
          </t>
        </list>
        </t>

        <t>For some measurement techniques, measurement error is largely
dependent on the measurement technique employed.  In these cases, measurement
error is largely a product of the measurement technique and not the specific
circumstances, so the RMS error does not need to be actively measured.  A fixed
value MAY be provided for the RMS error where appropriate.
        </t>

        <t>The <spanx style="verb">rmsError</spanx> and <spanx
style="verb">samples</spanx> elements are added as attributes of specific
measurement data types.
        </t>

        <section title="Time RMS Error">
          <t>Measurement of time can be significant in certain circumstances.  The GNSS measurements included in this document are one such case where a small error in time can result in a large error in location.  Factors such as clock drift and errors in time synchronization can result in small, but significant, time errors.  Including an indication of the quality of time measurements can be helpful.
          </t>

          <t>A <spanx style="verb">timeError</spanx> attribute MAY be added to the <spanx style="verb">measurement</spanx> element to indicate the RMS error in time.  <spanx style="verb">timeError</spanx> indicates an upper bound on the time RMS error in seconds.
          </t>

          <t>The <spanx style="verb">timeError</spanx> attribute does not apply where multiple samples of a measurement are taken over time.  If multiple samples are taken, each SHOULD be included in a different <spanx style="verb">measurement</spanx> element.
          </t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="mr" title="Measurement Request">
        <t>A measurement request is used by a protocol peer to describe a set of measurement data that it desires.  A <spanx style="verb">measurementRequest</spanx> element is defined that can be included in a protocol exchange.
        </t>

        <t>For instance, a LIS can use a measurement request in HELD responses.  If the LIS is unable to provide location information, but it believes that a particular measurement type would enable it to provide a location, it can include a measurement request in an error response.
        </t>

        <t>The <spanx style="verb">measurement</spanx> element of the measurement request identifies the type of measurement that is requested.  The <spanx style="verb">type</spanx> attribute of this element indicates the type of measurement, as identified by an XML qualified name.  A <spanx style="verb">samples</spanx> attribute MAY be used to indicate how many samples of the identified measurement are requested.
        </t>

        <t>The <spanx style="verb">measurement</spanx> element can be repeated to request multiple (or alternative) measurement types.
        </t>

        <t>Additional XML content might be defined for a particular measurement type that is used to further refine a request.  These elements either constrain what is requested or specify non-mandatory components of the measurement data that are needed.  These are defined along with the specific measurement type.
        </t>

        <t>In the HELD protocol, the inclusion of a measurement request in an error response with a code of <spanx style="verb">locationUnknown</spanx> indicates that providing measurements would increase the likelihood of a subsequent request being successful.

        <t>A <spanx style="verb">wifi</spanx> element is made up of one or more access points, and a <spanx style="verb">nicType</spanx> element, which MAY be omitted. Each access point is described using the <spanx style="verb">ap</spanx> element, which is comprised of the following fields:
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="bssid:">The Basic Service Set (BSS) identifier.  In an
Infrastructure BSS network, the bssid is the 48-bit MAC address of the access
point. <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          The <spanx style="verb">verified</spanx> attribute of this element
describes whether the Device has verified the MAC address or it authenticated
the access point or the network operating the access point (for example, a
captive portal accessed through the access point has been authenticated).  This
attribute defaults to a value of <spanx style="verb">false</spanx> when
omitted.

          <t hangText="ssid:">The service set identifier (SSID) for the wireless network served by the access point.
          <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          The SSID is a 32-octet identifier that is commonly represented as
an <xref target="ASCII">ASCII</xref> or <xref target="RFC3629">UTF-8</xref> encoded string.  To represent octets that cannot be directly included in an XML element, escaping is used.  Sequences of octets that do not represent a valid UTF-8 encoding can be escaped using a backslash ('\') followed by two case-insensitive hexadecimal digits representing the value of a single octet.
          <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          The canonical or value-space form of an SSID is a sequence of up to 32 octets that is produced from the concatenation of UTF-8 encoded sequences of unescaped characters and octets derived from escaped components.

introduced the radio interface, or PHY, e.g., <spanx style="verb">a</spanx>,
<spanx style="verb">b</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">g</spanx>, or <spanx

The <spanx style="verb">country</spanx> attribute optionally includes the
applicable two-character country identifier (dot11CountryString), which can be
followed by an 'O', 'I', or 'X'.  The element text content includes the value
of the regulatory class: an 8-bit integer in decimal form.
          </t>

time of departure (TOD) of signal from a transmitting station and time of
arrival (TOA) of signal at a receiving station, as defined in <xref
target="IEEE.80211"/>.  Measurement of this value requires that stations
synchronize their clocks.  This value can be measured by an access point or
Device; because the flight time is assumed to be the same in either direction
-- aside from measurement errors -- only a single element is provided.  This
element permits the use of the <spanx style="verb">rmsError</spanx> and <spanx

reported RMS error in TOD and TOA.

If power is measured in a different fashion, the <spanx style="verb">dBm</spanx> attribute MUST be set to <spanx style="verb">false</spanx>.  Signal strength reporting on current hardware uses a range of different mechanisms; therefore, the value of the <spanx style="verb">nicType</spanx> element SHOULD be included if the units are not known to be in dBm, and the value reported by the hardware should be included without modification.

        <t>In general, a cellular Device will be attached to the cellular
network, so the notion of a serving cell exists.  Cellular networks also
provide overlap between neighboring sites, so a mobile Device can hear more
than one cell.  The measurement schema supports sending both the serving cell
and any other cells that the mobile might be able to hear.  In some cases, the
Device could simply be listening to cell information without actually attaching
to the network; mobiles without a SIM are an example of this. In this case, the
Device could report cells it can hear without identifying any particular cell
as a serving cell.  An example of this is shown in <xref target="ex-obs-only"/>.

        <t hangText="Navigation message decode:">Once the signal has been acquired, the receiver then receives information about the configuration of the satellite constellation.

        <section title="GNSS: System Type and Signal">

          <t>The GNSS measurement structure is designed to be generic and to apply to different GNSS types.  Different signals within those systems are also accounted for and can be measured separately.

        <t>Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) networks rely on a range of network
technologies.  DSL deployments regularly require cooperation between multiple
organizations.  These fall into two broad categories: infrastructure providers
and Internet service providers (ISPs).  For the same end user, an
infrastructure and Internet service can be provided by different entities.
Infrastructure providers manage the bulk of the physical infrastructure,
including cabling.  End users obtain their service from an ISP, which manages
all aspects visible to the end user, including IP address allocation and
operation of a LIS.  See <xref target="DSL.TR025"/> and <xref
target="DSL.TR101"/> for further information on DSL network deployments and the
parameters that are available.
        </t>

        <t>Exchange of measurement information between these organizations is necessary for location information to be correctly generated.  The ISP LIS needs to acquire location information from the infrastructure provider.  However, since the infrastructure provider could have no knowledge of Device identifiers, it can only identify a stream of data that is sent to the ISP.  This is resolved by passing measurement data relating to the Device to a LIS operated by the infrastructure provider.

    <section anchor="privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t>Location-related measurement data can be as privacy sensitive as <xref target="RFC6280">location information</xref>.
      </t>

      <t>Measurement data is effectively equivalent to location information if the contextual knowledge necessary to generate one from the other is readily accessible.  Even where contextual knowledge is difficult to acquire, there can be no assurance that an authorized recipient of the contextual knowledge is also authorized to receive location information.
      </t>

      <t>In order to protect the privacy of the subject of location-related
measurement data, measurement data MUST be protected with the same degree of
protection as location information.  The confidentiality and authentication
provided by Transport Layer Security (TLS) MUST be used in order to convey
measurement data over <xref target="RFC5985">HELD</xref>.  Other protocols MUST
provide comparable guarantees.
      </t>

      <section anchor="privacymodel" title="Measurement Data Privacy Model">
        <t>It is not necessary to distribute measurement data in the same fashion as location information.  Measurement data is less useful to location recipients than location information.  A simple distribution model is described in this document.
        </t>

        <t>In this simple model, the Device is the only entity that is able to
distribute measurement data.  To use an analogy from the GEOPRIV architecture,
the Device -- as the Location Generator or the Measurement Data Generator --
is the sole entity that can act in the role of both Rule Maker and Location
Server.
        </t>

        <t>A Device that provides location-related measurement data MUST only
do so as explicitly authorized by a Rule Maker.  This depends on having an
interface that allows Rule Makers (for instance, users or administrators) to
control where and how measurement data is provided. 
        </t>

        <t>No entity is permitted to redistribute measurement data.  The Device directs other entities regarding how measurement data is used and retained.
        </t>

        <t>The <xref target="RFC6280">GEOPRIV model</xref> protects the location of a Target using direction provided by a Rule Maker.  For the purposes of measurement data distribution, this model relies on the assumptions made in Section 3 of <xref target="RFC5985">HELD</xref>.  These assumptions effectively declare the Device to be a proxy for both Target and Rule Maker.

      <section title="LIS Privacy Requirements">
        <t>A LIS MUST NOT reveal location-related measurement data to any other entity.  A LIS MUST NOT reveal location information based on measurement data to any other entity unless directed to do so by the Device.
        </t>

        <t>By adding measurement data to a request for location information, the Device implicitly grants permission for the LIS to generate the requested location information using the measurement data.  Permission to use this data for any other purpose is not implied.
        </t>

        <t>As long as measurement data is only used in serving the request that contains it, rules regarding data retention are not necessary.  A LIS MUST discard location-related measurement data after servicing a request, unless the Device grants permission to use that information for other purposes.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Measurement Data and Location URIs">
        <t>A LIS MAY use measurement data provided by the Device to serve requests to location URIs, if the Device permits it.  A Device permits this by including measurement data in a request that explicitly requests a location URI.  By requesting a location URI, the Device grants permission for the LIS to use the measurement data in serving requests to that location URI.  The LIS cannot provide location recipients with measurement data, as defined in <xref target="privacymodel"/>.

        <t>The usefulness of measurement data that is provided in this fashion is limited.  The measurement data is only valid at the time that it was acquired by the Device.  At the time that a request is made to a location URI, the Device might have moved, rendering the measurement data incorrect.
        </t>

        <t>A Device is able to explicitly limit the time that a LIS retains
measurement data by adding an expiry time to the measurement data.  A LIS MUST
NOT retain location-related measurement data in memory, storage, or logs beyond
the time indicated in the <spanx style="verb">expires</spanx> attribute (<xref

        <t>Location-related measurement data describes the physical environment
or network attachment of a Device.  A third-party adversary in the proximity of
the Device might be able to alter the physical environment such that the Device
provides measurement data that is controlled by the third party.  This might be
used to indirectly control the location information that is derived from
measurement data.

        <section anchor="unauth" title="Acquiring Location Information without Authorization">
          <t>Requiring authorization for location requests is an important part
of privacy protections of a location protocol.  A location configuration
protocol usually operates under a restricted policy that allows a requester to
obtain their own location.  <xref target="RFC6155">HELD identity
extensions</xref> allow other entities to be authorized, conditional on a Rule
Maker providing sufficient authorization.
          </t>

          <t>The intent of these protections is to ensure that a location recipient is authorized to acquire location information.  Location-related measurement data could be used by an attacker to circumvent such authorization checks if the association between measurement data and Target Device is not validated by a LIS.
          </t>

          <t>A LIS can be coerced into providing location information for a Device that a location recipient is not authorized to receive.  A request identifies one Device (implicitly or explicitly), but measurement data is provided for another Device.  If the LIS does not check that the measurement data is for the identified Device, it could incorrectly authorize the request.
          </t>

          <t>By using unverified measurement data to generate a response, the LIS provides information about a Device without appropriate authorization.
          </t>

          <t>The feasibility of this attack depends on the availability of information that links a Device with measurement data.  In some cases, measurement data that is correlated with a Target is readily available.  For instance, <xref target="lldp">LLDP measurements</xref> are broadcast to all nodes on the same network segment.  An attacker on that network segment can easily gain measurement data that relates a Device with measurements.
          </t>

          <t>For some types of measurement data, it's necessary for an attacker to know the location of the Target in order to determine what measurements to use.  This attack is meaningless for types of measurement data that require that the attacker first know the location of the Target before measurement data can be acquired or fabricated.  <xref target="gnss">GNSS measurements</xref> share this trait with many wireless location determination methods.

        <section anchor="topomap" title="Extracting Network Topology Data">
          <t>Allowing requests with measurements might be used to collect
information about network topology.
          </t>

          <t>Network topology can be considered sensitive information by a
network operator for commercial or security reasons.  While it is impossible to
completely prevent a Device from acquiring some knowledge of network topology
if a location service is provided, a network operator might desire to limit how
much of this information is made available.
          </t>

          <t>Mapping a network topology does not require that an attacker be
able to associate measurement data with a particular Device.  If a requester is
able to try a number of measurements, it is possible to acquire information
about network topology.
          </t>

guesses are sufficient, provided that there is no penalty or cost associated

          <t>A Device could reveal information about a network to entities

measurements in this document provide information about an access network that
could reveal topology information to an unauthorized recipient.

          <t>A Device MUST NOT provide information about network topology
without a clear signal that the recipient is authorized.  A LIS that is
discovered using DHCP as described in <xref target="RFC5986">LIS

        <section anchor="lying" title="Lying by Proxy">
          <t>Location information, which includes measurement data, is a
function of its inputs.  Thus, falsified measurement data can be used to alter
the location information that is provided by a LIS.
          </t>

          <t>Some types of measurement data are relatively easy to falsify in a
way that causes the resulting location information to be selected with little
or no error.  For instance, GNSS measurements are easy to use for this purpose
because all the contextual information necessary to calculate a position using
measurements is broadcast by the satellites <xref target="HARPER"/>.
          </t>

          <t>An attacker that falsifies measurement data gains little if they
are the only recipient of the result.  The attacker knows that the location
information is bad.  The attacker only gains if the information can somehow be
attributed to the LIS by another location recipient.  By coercing the LIS into
providing falsified location information, any credibility that the LIS might
have -- that the attacker does not -- is gained by the attacker.
          </t>

          <t>A third party that is reliant on the integrity of the location
information might base an evaluation of the credibility of the information on
the source of the information.  If that third party is able to attribute
location information to the LIS, then an attacker might gain.
          </t>

          <t>Location information that is provided to the Device without any
means to identify the LIS as its source is not subject to this attack.  The
Device is identified as the source of the data when it distributes the location
information to location recipients.
          </t>

          <t>Location information is attributed to the LIS either through the
use of digital signatures or by having the location recipient directly interact
with the LIS.  A LIS that digitally signs location information becomes
identifiable as the source of the data.  Similarly, the LIS is identified as a
source of data if a location recipient acquires information directly from a LIS
using a location URI.

result of the practicalities of operating the network.  Limiting
the changes to a network ensures greater consistency of service.  A largely
static network also greatly simplifies the data management tasks involved with
providing a location service.  However, time-invariant properties allow for
simple replay attacks, where an attacker acquires measurements that can later
be used without being detected as being invalid.
          </t>

          <t>Measurement data is frequently an observation of a time-invariant
property of the environment at the subject location.  For measurements of this
nature, nothing in the measurement itself is sufficient proof that the Device
is present at the resulting location.  Measurement data might have been
previously acquired and reused.
          </t>

          <t>For instance, the identity of a radio transmitter, if broadcast by that transmitter, can be collected and stored.  An attacker that wishes it known that they exist at a particular location can claim to observe this transmitter at any time.  Nothing inherent in the claim reveals it to be false.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="environment" title="Environment Spoofing">
          <t>Some types of measurement data can be altered or influenced by a
third party so that a Device unwittingly provides falsified data.  If it is
possible for a third party to alter the measured phenomenon, then any location
information that is derived from this data can be indirectly influenced.
          </t>

          <t>Altering the environment in this fashion might not require
involvement with either a Device or LIS.  Measurement that is passive -- where
the Device observes a signal or other phenomenon without direct interaction --
is most susceptible to alteration by third parties.
          </t>

          <t>Measurement of radio signal characteristics is especially
vulnerable, since an adversary need only be in the general vicinity of the
Device and be able to transmit a signal.  For instance, a GNSS spoofer is able
to produce fake signals that claim to be transmitted by any satellite or set of
satellites (see <xref target="GPS.SPOOF"/>).
          </t>

          <t>Measurements that require direct interaction increase the
complexity of the attack.  For measurements relating to the communication
medium, a third party cannot avoid direct interaction; they need only be on
the communications path (that is, man in the middle).
          </t>

          <t>Even if the entity that is interacted with is authenticated, this
does not provide any assurance about the integrity of measurement data.  For
instance, the Device might authenticate the identity of a radio transmitter
through the use of cryptographic means and obtain signal strength measurements
for that transmitter.  Radio signal strength is trivial for an attacker to
increase simply by receiving and amplifying the raw signal; it is not necessary
for the attacker to be able to understand the signal content.

          <list style="empty">
            <t>Note: This particular "attack" is more often completely
            legitimate.  Radio repeaters are a commonplace mechanism used to
            increase radio coverage.
            </t>
          </list>
          </t>

          <t>Attacks that rely on altering the observed environment of a Device
require countermeasures that affect the measurement process.  For radio
signals, countermeasures could include the use of authenticated signals, or
altered receiver design.  In general, countermeasures are highly specific to
the individual measurement process.  An exhaustive discussion of these issues
is left to the relevant literature for each measurement technology.
          </t>

          <t>A Device that provides measurement data is assumed to be
responsible for applying appropriate countermeasures against this type of
attack.
          </t>

          <t>Where a Device is the sole recipient of location information
derived from measurement data, a LIS might choose to provide location
information without any validation.  The responsibility for ensuring the
veracity of the measurement data lies with the Device.
          </t>

          <t>Measurement data that is susceptible to this sort of influence
SHOULD be treated as though it were produced by an untrusted Device for those
cases where a location recipient might attribute the location information to
the LIS.  GNSS measurements and radio signal strength measurements can be
affected relatively cheaply, though almost all other measurement types can be
affected with varying costs to an attacker, with the largest cost often being a
requirement for physical access.  To the extent that it is feasible,
measurement data SHOULD be subjected to the same validation as for other types
of attacks that rely on measurement falsification.

          <list style="empty">
          <t>Note: Altered measurement data might be provided by a Device
          that has no knowledge of the alteration.  Thus, an otherwise
          trusted Device might still be an unreliable source of measurement
          data.

      <section title="Mitigation">
        <t>The following measures can be applied to limit or prevent attacks.  The effectiveness of each depends on the type of measurement data and how that measurement data is acquired.
        </t>

        <t>Two general approaches are identified for dealing with untrusted measurement data:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Require independent validation of measurement data or the location information that is produced.
          </t>
          <t>Identify the types of sources that provided the measurement data
from which that location information was derived.
          </t>
        </list>
        This section goes into more detail on the different forms of validation
in Sections <xref target="validate" format="counter"/>, <xref target="locvalidate" format="counter"/>, and <xref target="corroborate" format="counter"/>.  The impact of attributing location information to
sources is discussed in more detail in <xref target="attribution"/>.
        </t>

        <t>Any costs in validation are balanced against the degree of integrity desired from the resulting location information.
        </t>

        <section anchor="validate" title="Measurement Validation">
           <t>Recognizing that measurement data has been falsified is difficult in the absence of integrity mechanisms.
          </t>

         <t>Independent confirmation of the veracity of measurement data ensures that the measurement is accurate and that it applies to the correct Device.  When it's possible to gather the same measurement data from a trusted and independent source without undue expense, the LIS can use the trusted data in place of what the untrusted Device has sent.  In cases where that is impractical, the untrusted data can provide hints that allow corroboration of the data (see <xref target="validate-effectiveness"/>).
          </t>

          <t>Measurement information might not contain any inherent indication that
it is falsified. In addition, it can be difficult to obtain information
that would provide any degree of assurance that the measurement device is
physically at any particular location.  Measurements that are difficult to
verify require other forms of assurance before they can be used.
          </t>

          <section anchor="validate-effectiveness" title="Effectiveness">
            <t>Measurement validation MUST be used if measurement data for a particular Device can be easily acquired by unauthorized location recipients, as described in <xref target="unauth"/>.  This prevents unauthorized access to location information using measurement data.
            </t>

            <t>Validation of measurement data can be significantly more effective than independent acquisition of the same.  For instance, a Device in a large Ethernet network could provide a measurement indicating its point of attachment using LLDP measurements.  For a LIS, acquiring the same measurement data might require a request to all switches in that network.  With the measurement data, validation can target the identified switch with a specific query.
            </t>

            <t>Validation is effective in identifying <xref
target="lying">falsified measurement data</xref>, including attacks involving
<xref target="replay">replay of measurement data</xref>.  Validation also
limits the amount of <xref target="topomap">network topology information</xref>
made available to Devices to that portion of the network topology to which
they are directly attached.
            </t>

            <t>Measurement validation has no effect if the <xref
target="environment">underlying environment is being altered</xref>.
            </t>
          </section>

          <section anchor="uniqueobs" title="Limitations (Unique Observer)">
            <t>A Device is often in a unique position to make a measurement.  It alone occupies the point in space-time that the location determination process seeks to determine.  The Device becomes a unique observer for a particular property.
            </t>

            <t>The ability of the Device to become a unique observer makes the Device invaluable to the location determination process.  As a unique observer, it also makes the claims of a Device difficult to validate and easy to spoof.
            </t>

            <t>As long as no other entity is capable of making the same measurements, there is also no other entity that can independently check that the measurements are correct and applicable to the Device.  A LIS might be unable to validate all or part of the measurement data it receives from a unique observer.  For instance, a signal strength measurement of the signal from a radio tower cannot be validated directly.
            </t>

            <t>Some portion of the measurement data might still be independently verified, even if all information cannot.  In the previous example, the radio tower might be able to provide verification that the Device is present if it is able to observe a radio signal sent by the Device.
            </t>

            <t>If measurement data can only be partially validated, the extent to which it can be validated determines the effectiveness of validation against these attacks.
            </t>

            <t>The advantage of having the Device as a unique observer is that it makes it difficult for an attacker to acquire measurements without the assistance of the Device.  Attempts to use measurements to gain <xref target="unauth">unauthorized access to measurement data</xref> are largely ineffectual against a unique observer.
            </t>
          </section>
        </section>

        <section anchor="locvalidate" title="Location Validation">
          <t>Location information that is derived from location-related measurement data can also be verified against trusted location information.  Rather than validating inputs to the location determination process, suspect locations are identified at the output of the process.
          </t>

          <t>Trusted location information is acquired using sources of measurement data that are trusted.  Untrusted location information is acquired using measurement data provided from untrusted sources, which might include the Device.  These two locations are compared.  If the untrusted location agrees with the trusted location, the untrusted location information is used.
          </t>

          <t>Algorithms for the comparison of location information are not included in this document.  However, a simple comparison for agreement might require that the untrusted location be entirely contained within the uncertainty region of the trusted location.
          </t>

          <t>There is little point in using a less accurate, less trusted
location.  Untrusted location information that has worse accuracy than trusted
information can be immediately discarded.  There are multiple factors that
affect accuracy, uncertainty and currency being the most important.  How
location information is compared for accuracy is not defined in this document.
          </t>

          <section title="Effectiveness">
            <t>Location validation limits the extent to which falsified -- or
erroneous -- measurement data can cause an incorrect location to be reported.
            </t>

            <t>Location validation can be more efficient than validation of inputs, particularly for a <xref target="uniqueobs">unique observer</xref>.
            </t>

            <t>Validating location ensures that the Device is at or near the resulting location.  Location validation can be used to limit or prevent all of the attacks identified in this document.
            </t>
          </section>

          <section title="Limitations">
            <t>The trusted location that is used for validation is always less accurate than the location that is being checked.  The amount by which the untrusted location is more accurate, is the same amount that an attacker can exploit.
            </t>

            <t>For example, a trusted location might indicate an uncertainty
region with a radius of five kilometers.  An untrusted location that describes
a 100-meter uncertainty within the larger region might be accepted as more
accurate.  An attacker might still falsify measurement data to select any
location within the larger uncertainty region.  While the 100-meter
uncertainty that is reported seems more accurate, a falsified location could
be anywhere in the five&nbhy;kilometer region.
            </t>

            <t>Where measurement data might have been falsified, the actual
uncertainty is effectively much higher.  Local policy might allow differing
degrees of trust to location information derived from untrusted measurement
data.  This might be a boolean operation with only two possible outcomes:
untrusted location information might be used entirely or not at all.
Alternatively, untrusted location information could be combined with trusted
location information using different weightings, based on a value set in local
policy.
            </t>
          </section>
        </section>

        <section anchor="corroborate" title="Supporting Observations">
          <t>Replay attacks using previously acquired measurement data are particularly hard to detect without independent validation.  Rather than validate the measurement data directly, supplementary data might be used to validate measurements or the location information derived from those measurements.
          </t>

          <t>These supporting observations could be used to convey information
that provides additional assurance that measurement data from the Device was
acquired at a specific time and place.  In effect, the Device is requested to
provide proof of its presence at the resulting location.
          </t>

          <t>For instance, a Device that measures attributes of a radio signal could also be asked to provide a sample of the measured radio signal.  If the LIS is able to observe the same signal, the two observations could be compared.  Providing that the signal cannot be predicted in advance by the Device, this could be used to support the claim that the Device is able to receive the signal.  Thus, the Device is likely to be within the range that the signal is transmitted.  A LIS could use this to attribute a higher level of trust in the associated measurement data or resulting location.
          </t>

          <section title="Effectiveness">
            <t>The use of supporting observations is limited by the ability of the LIS to acquire and validate these observations.  The advantage of selecting observations independent of measurement data is that observations can be selected based on how readily available the data is for both LIS and Device.  The amount and quality of the data can be selected based on the degree of assurance that is desired.
            </t>

            <t>The use of supporting observations is similar to both
measurement validation and location validation.  All three methods rely on
independent validation of one or more properties.  The applicability of each
method is similar.
            </t>

            <t>The use of supporting observations can be used to limit or prevent all of the attacks identified in this document.
            </t>
          </section>

          <section title="Limitations">
            <t>The effectiveness of the validation method depends on the
quality of the supporting observation: how hard it is for the entity performing
the validation to obtain the data at a different time or place, how difficult
it is to guess, and what other costs might be involved in acquiring this data.
            </t>

            <t>In the example of an observed radio signal, requesting a sample of the signal only provides an assurance that the Device is able to receive the signal transmitted by the measured radio transmitter.  This only provides some assurance that the Device is within range of the transmitter.
            </t>

            <t>As with location validation, a Device might still be able to provide falsified measurements that could alter the value of the location information as long as the result is within this region.
            </t>

            <t>Requesting additional supporting observations can reduce the size of the region over which location information can be altered by an attacker, or increase trust in the result, but each additional measurement imposes an acquisition cost.  Supporting observations contribute little or nothing toward the primary goal of determining the location of the Device.

        <section anchor="attribution" title="Attribution">
          <t><xref target="lying">Lying by proxy</xref> relies on the location recipient being able to attribute location information to a LIS.  The effectiveness of this attack is negated if location information is explicitly attributed to a particular source.
          </t>

          <t>This requires an extension to the location object that explicitly identifies the source (or sources) of each item of location information.
          </t>

          <t>Rather than relying on a process that seeks to ensure that location information is accurate, this approach instead provides a location recipient with the information necessary to reach their own conclusion about the trustworthiness of the location information.
          </t>

          <t>Including an authenticated identity for all sources of measurement
data presents a number of technical and operational challenges.  It is possible
that the LIS has a transient relationship with a Device.  A Device is not
expected to share authentication information with a LIS.  There is no assurance
that Device identification is usable by a potential location recipient.
Privacy concerns might also prevent the sharing of identification information,
even if it were available and usable.
          </t>

          <t>Identifying the type of measurement source allows a location recipient to make a decision about the trustworthiness of location information without depending on having authenticated identity information for each source.  An element for this purpose is defined in <xref target="source"/>.
          </t>

          <t>When including location information that is based on measurement data from sources that might be untrusted, a LIS SHOULD include alternative location information that is derived from trusted sources of measurement data.  Each item of location information can then be labeled with the source of that data.
          </t>

          <t>A location recipient that is able to identify a specific source of
measurement data (whether it be LIS or Device) can use this information to
attribute location information to either entity or to both entities.  The
location recipient is then better able to make decisions about trustworthiness
based on the source of the data.
          </t>

          <t>A location recipient that does not understand the <spanx style="verb">source</spanx> element is unable to make this distinction.  When constructing a PIDF-LO document, trusted location information MUST be placed in the PIDF-LO so that it is given higher priority to any untrusted location information according to Rule #8 of <xref target="RFC5491"/>.

          <t>Simply limiting the rate of requests from a single Device reduces
the amount of data that a Device can acquire about network topology.  A LIS
could also make observations about the movements of a Device.  A Device that is
attempting to gather topology information is likely to be assigned a location
that changes significantly between subsequent requests, possibly violating
physical laws (or lower limits that might still be unlikely) with respect to
speed and acceleration.

        <t>A compromised LIS, or a compromise in <xref target="RFC5986">LIS

ensure that it authenticates a LIS, as described in Section 9 of <xref

        <t>An entity that is able to acquire measurement data can, in addition

        <t>Measurement data might also be exploited in other ways.

    <section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This section creates a registry for <xref target="gnss">GNSS types</xref> and registers the namespaces and schemas defined in <xref target="schema"/>.
      </t>

      <section anchor="iana-gnss" title="IANA Registry for GNSS Types">
        <t>This document establishes a new IANA registry for "Global Navigation
Satellite System (GNSS)" types.  The registry includes tokens for the GNSS type
and for each of the signals within that type.  Referring to <xref
target="RFC5226"/>, this registry operates under "Specification Required"
rules.  The IESG will appoint an Expert Reviewer who will advise IANA promptly
on each request for a new or updated GNSS type.

        </t>

        <t>Each entry in the registry requires the following information:
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="GNSS Name:">the name of the GNSS
          </t>
          <t hangText="Brief Description:">a brief description of the GNSS
          </t>
          <t hangText="GNSS Token:">a token that can be used to identify the GNSS
          </t>
          <t hangText="Signals:">a set of tokens that represent each of the signals that the system provides
          </t>
          <t hangText="Documentation Reference:">a reference to one or more stable, public specifications that outline usage of the GNSS, including (but not limited to) signal specifications and time systems
          </t>
        </list>
        </t>

        <t>The registry initially includes two registrations:
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="GNSS Name:">Global Positioning System (GPS)
          </t>
          <t hangText="Brief Description:">a system of satellites that use spread-spectrum transmission, operated by the US military for commercial and military applications
