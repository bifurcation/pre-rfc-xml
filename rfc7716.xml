    <abstract>
      <t>
        RFCs 6513, 6514, and others describe protocols and procedures
        that a Service Provider (SP) may deploy in order to offer Multicast
        Virtual Private Network (Multicast VPN or MVPN) service to its
        customers.  Some of these procedures use BGP to distribute
        VPN-specific multicast routing information across a backbone
        network.  With a small number of relatively minor modifications, the
        same BGP procedures can also be used to distribute multicast
        routing information that is not specific to any VPN.  Multicast that
        is outside the context of a VPN is known as "Global Table
        Multicast", or sometimes simply as "Internet multicast".  In this
        document, we describe the modifications that are needed to use the
        BGP-MVPN procedures for Global Table Multicast.

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="Introduction">
      <t>
        <xref target="RFC4364"/> specifies architecture, protocols, and
        procedures that a Service Provider (SP) can use to provide Virtual
        Private Network (VPN) service to its customers.  In that
        architecture, one or more Customer Edge (CE) routers attach to a
        Provider Edge (PE) router.  Each CE router belongs to a single VPN,
        but CE routers from several VPNs may attach to the same PE router.
        In addition, CEs from the same VPN may attach to different PEs.  BGP
        is used to carry VPN-specific information among the PEs.  Each PE
        router maintains a separate Virtual Routing and Forwarding table
        (VRF) for each VPN to which it is attached.
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref target="RFC6513"/> and <xref target="RFC6514"/> extend the
        procedures of <xref target="RFC4364"/> to allow the SP to provide
        multicast service to its VPN customers.  The customer's multicast
        routing protocol (e.g., PIM) is used to exchange multicast routing
        information between a CE and a PE.  The PE stores a given customer's
        multicast routing information in the VRF for that customer's VPN.
        BGP is used to distribute certain multicast-related control
        information among the PEs that attach to a given VPN, and BGP may
        also be used to exchange the customer multicast routing information
        itself among the PEs.
      </t>
      <t>
        While this multicast architecture was originally developed for VPNs,
        it can also be used (with a small number of modifications to the
        procedures) to distribute multicast routing information that is not
        specific to VPNs.  The purpose of this document is to specify the
        way in which BGP-MVPN procedures can be adapted to support non-VPN
        multicast.
      </t>
      <t>
        Multicast routing information that is not specific to VPNs is stored
        in a router's "global table", rather than in a VRF; hence, it is
        known as "Global Table Multicast" (GTM).  GTM is sometimes more
        simply called "Internet multicast".  However, we will avoid that
        term because it suggests that the multicast data streams are
        available on the "public" Internet.  The procedures for GTM can
        certainly be used to support multicast on the public Internet, but
        they can also be used to support multicast streams that are not
        public, e.g., content distribution streams offered by content
        providers to paid subscribers.  For the purposes of this document,
        all that matters is that the multicast routing information is
        maintained in a global table rather than in a VRF.
      </t>
      <t>
        This architecture does assume that the network over which the
        multicast streams travel can be divided into a "core network" and
        one or more non-core parts of the network, which we shall call
        "attachment networks".  The multicast routing protocol used in the
        attachment networks may not be the same as the one used in the core,
        so we consider there to be a "protocol boundary" between the core
        network and the attachment networks.  We will use the term "Protocol
        Boundary Router" (PBR) to refer to the core routers that are at the
        boundary.  We will use the term "Attachment Router" (AR) to refer to
        the routers that attach to the PBRs but are not in the core.
        <!-- [ecr] Made a slight change to above sentence. -->
      </t>
      <t>
        This document does not make any particular set of assumptions about
        the protocols that the ARs and the PBRs use to exchange unicast and
        multicast routing information with each other.  For instance,
        multicast routing information could be exchanged between an AR and a
        PBR via PIM, IGMP, or even BGP.  Multicast routing also depends on
        an exchange of routes that are used for looking up the path to the
        root of a multicast tree.  This routing information could be
        exchanged between an AR and a PBR via IGP, via EBGP, or via IBGP
        <xref target="RFC6368"/>.  Note that if IBGP is used, the "push" and
        "pop" procedures described in <xref target="RFC6368"/> are not
        necessary.
      </t>
      <t>
        The PBRs are not necessarily "edge routers", in the sense of <xref
        target="RFC4364"/>.  For example, they may be both be Autonomous
        System Border Routers (ASBRs).  As another example, an AR may be an
        "access router" attached to a PBR that is an OSPF Area Border Router
        (ABR).  Many other deployment scenarios are possible.  However, the
        PBRs are always considered to be delimiting a "backbone" or "core"
        network.  A multicast data stream from an AR is tunneled over the
        core network from an ingress PBR to one or more egress PBRs.
        Multicast routing information that a PBR learns from the ARs
        attached to it is stored in the PBR's global table.  The PBRs use
        BGP to distribute multicast routing and auto-discovery information
        among themselves.  This is done following the procedures of <xref
        target="RFC6513"/>, <xref target="RFC6514"/>, and other MVPN
        specifications, as modified in this document.
      </t>
      <t>
        In general, PBRs follow the same BGP-MVPN procedures that PE routers
        follow, except that these procedures are adapted to be applicable to
        the global table rather than to a VRF.  Details are provided in
        subsequent sections of this document.
      </t>

      <t>
        By supporting GTM using the BGP procedures designed for MVPN, one
        obtains a single control plane that governs the use of both VPN and
        non-VPN multicast.  Most of the features and characteristics of MVPN
        carry over automatically to GTM.  These include scaling,
        aggregation, flexible choice of tunnel technology in the SP network,
        support for both segmented and non-segmented tunnels, ability to use
        wildcards to identify sets of multicast flows, support for the
        Any-Source Multicast (ASM), Source-Specific Multicast (SSM), and
        Bidirectional (bidir) multicast paradigms, support for both IPv4 and
        IPv6 multicast flows over either an IPv4 or IPv6 SP infrastructure,
        support for unsolicited flooded data (including support for
        Bootstrap Router (BSR) as an RP-to-group mapping protocol), etc.
        <!-- [ecr] made a slight change to the above sentence -->
      </t>
      <t>
        This document not only uses MVPN procedures for GTM but also,
        insofar as possible, uses the same protocol elements, encodings, and
        formats.  The BGP Updates for GTM thus use the same Subsequent
        Address Family Identifier (SAFI) and have the same Network Layer
        Reachability Information (NLRI) format as the BGP Updates for MVPN.
      </t>
      <t>
        Details for supporting MVPN (either IPv4 or IPv6 MVPN traffic) over
        an IPv6 backbone network can be found in <xref target="RFC6515"/>.
        The procedures and encodings described therein are also applicable
        to GTM.
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref target="RFC7524"/> extends <xref
        target="RFC6514"/> by providing procedures that allow tunnels
        through the core to be "segmented" at ABRs within the core.  The ABR
        segmentation procedures are also applicable to GTM as defined in the
        current document.  In general, the MVPN procedures of <xref
        target="RFC7524"/>, adapted as specified in the current
        document, are applicable to GTM.
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref target="RFC7524"/> also defines a set of
        procedures for GTM.  Those procedures are different from the
        procedures defined in the current document, and the two sets of
        procedures are not interoperable with each other.  The two sets of
        procedures can co-exist in the same network, as long as they are not
        applied to the same multicast flows or to the same multicast group
        addresses.  See <xref target="differences"/> for more details.

        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

    <section title="Adapting MVPN Procedures to GTM" anchor="mvpn-gtm">
      <t>
        In general, PBRs support Global Table Multicast by using the
        procedures that PE routers use to support VPN multicast.  For GTM,
        where <xref target="RFC6513"/> and <xref target="RFC6514"/> talk
        about the "PE-CE interface", one should interpret that to mean the
        interface between the AR and the PBR.  For GTM, where <xref
        target="RFC6513"/> and <xref target="RFC6514"/> talk about the
        "backbone" network, one should interpret that to mean the part of
        the network that is delimited by the PBRs.
      </t>
      <t>
        A few adaptations to the procedures of <xref target="RFC6513"/> and
        <xref target="RFC6514"/> need to be made.  Those adaptations are
        described in the following sub-sections.
      </t>
      <section title="Use of Route Distinguishers" anchor="RDs">
        <t>
          The MVPN procedures require the use of BGP routes, defined in
          <xref target="RFC6514"/>, that have a SAFI value of 5
          ("MCAST-VPN").  We refer to these simply as "MCAST-VPN routes".
          <xref target="RFC6514"/> defines the Network Layer Reachability
          Information (NLRI) format for MCAST-VPN routes.  The NLRI field
          always begins with a "Route Type" octet, and, depending on the
          route type, may be followed by a Route Distinguisher (RD) field.
        </t>
        <t>
          When a PBR originates an MCAST-VPN route in support of GTM, the RD
          field (for those routes types where it is defined) of that route's
          NLRI MUST be set to zero (i.e., to 64 bits of zero).  Since no VRF
          may have an RD of zero, this allows MCAST-VPN routes that are
          about GTM to be distinguished from MCAST-VPN routes that are
          about VPNs.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Use of Route Targets" anchor="RTs">
        
<t>
          The MVPN procedures require all MCAST-VPN routes to carry Route
          Targets (RTs).  When a PE router receives an MCAST-VPN route, it
          processes the route in the context of a particular VRF if and only
          if the route is carrying an RT that is configured as one of that
          VRF's "import RTs".
        </t>
        <t>
          There are two different kinds of RT used in MVPN.
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              One kind of RT is carried only by the following MCAST-VPN
              route types:  C-multicast Shared Tree Joins, C-multicast
              Source Tree Joins, and Leaf auto-discovery routes (A-D routes).  This kind of RT
              identifies the PE router that has been selected by the route's
              originator as the "Upstream PE" or as the "Upstream Multicast
              Hop" (UMH) for a particular (set of) multicast flow(s).  Per
              <xref target="RFC6514"/> and <xref target="RFC6515"/>, this RT
              must be an IPv4-address-specific or IPv6-address-specific
              Extended Community (EC), whose Global Administrator field
              identifies the Upstream PE or the UMH.  If the Global
              Administrator field identifies the Upstream PE, the Local
              Administrator field identifies a particular VRF in that PE.
              <vspace blankLines="1"/>


              The GTM procedures of this document require the use of this
              type of RT, in exactly the same situations where it is used in
              the MVPN specification <xref target="RFC6514"/>.  However, one adaptation is necessary:
              the Local Administrator field of this kind of RT MUST always
              be set to zero, thus implicitly identifying the global table
              rather than identifying a VRF.  We will refer to this kind of
              RT as an "upstream-node-identifying RT".
            </t>

            <t>
              The other kind of RT is the conventional RT first specified in
              <xref target="RFC4364"/>. It does not necessarily identify a
              particular router by address but is used to constrain the
              distribution of VPN routes and to ensure that a given VPN
              route is processed in the context of a given VRF if and only
              if the route is carrying an RT that has been configured as one
              of that VRF's "import RTs".
              <vspace blankLines="1"/>

     Whereas every VRF must be configured with at least one import RT,
     there has been no requirement to configure any RTs for the
     global table of any router until now.
              As stated above, this
              document makes the use of upstream-node-identifying RTs
              mandatory for GTM.  This document makes the use of
              non-upstream-node-identifying RTs OPTIONAL for GTM.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The procedures for the use of RTs in GTM are the following:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              If the global table of a particular PBR is NOT configured with
              any import RTs, then a received MCAST-VPN route is processed
              in the context of the global table only if it is carrying no
              RTs or if it is carrying an upstream-node-identifying RT
              whose Global Administrator field identifies that PBR.
            </t>
            <t>
              The global table in each PBR MAY be configured with (a) a set
              of export RTs to be attached to MCAST-VPN routes that are
              originated to support GTM and (b) a set of import RTs
              for GTM.

              <vspace blankLines="1"/>
              If the global table of a given PBR has been so configured, the
              PBR will process a received MCAST-VPN route in the context of
              the global table if and only if the route carries an RT that
              is one of the global table's import RTs or if the route
              carries an upstream-node-identifying RT whose Global
              Administrator field identifies the PBR.

              <vspace blankLines="1"/>
              If the global tables are configured with RTs, care must be
              taken to ensure that the RTs configured for the global table
              are distinct from any RTs used in support of MVPN (except in
              the case where it is actually intended to create an "extranet"
              <xref target="MVPN-extranet"/> in which some sources are
              reachable in global table context while others are reachable

          In <xref target="RFC6513"/>, the UMH-eligible routes (see Section
          5.1.1 of <xref target="RFC6513"/>, "Eligible Routes for UMH
          Selection") are generally routes of SAFI 128 (Labeled VPN-IP
          routes) or 129 (VPN-IP multicast routes) and are required to
          carry RTs.  These RTs determine which VRFs import which such
          routes.  However, for GTM, when the UMH-eligible routes may be
          routes of SAFI 1, 2, or 4, the routes are not required to carry
          RTs.  This document does NOT specify any new rules for determining
          whether a SAFI 1, 2, or 4 route is to be imported into the global
          table of any PBR.

          Section 5.1 of <xref target="RFC6513"/> defines procedures by which a
          PE router determines the "C-root", the "Upstream Multicast Hop"
          (UMH), the "Upstream PE", and the "Upstream RD" of a given
          multicast flow.  (In non-VPN multicast documents, the UMH of a
          multicast flow at a particular router is generally known as the
          "RPF neighbor" for that flow.)  It also defines procedures for
          determining the "Source AS" of a particular flow.  Note that in
          GTM, the "Upstream PE" is actually the "Upstream PBR".
        </t>
        <t>
          The definition of the C-root of a flow is the same for GTM as for
          MVPN.
        </t>
        <t>
          For MVPN, to determine the UMH, Upstream PE, Upstream RD, and
          Source AS of a flow, one looks up the C-root of the flow in a
          particular VRF and finds the "UMH-eligible" routes (see Section
          5.1.1 of <xref target="RFC6513"/>) that "match" the C-root.  From
          among these, one is chosen as the "Selected UMH Route".
        </t>
        <t>
          For GTM, the C-root is, of course, looked up in the global table,
          rather than in a VRF.  For MVPN, the UMH-eligible routes are
          routes of SAFI 128 or 129.  For GTM, the UMH-eligible routes are
          routes of SAFI 1, SAFI 4, or SAFI 2.  If the global table has
          imported routes of SAFI 2, then these are the UMH-eligible routes.
          Otherwise, routes of SAFI 1 or SAFI 4 are the UMH-eligible routes.
          For the purpose of UMH determination, if a SAFI 1 route and a SAFI
          4 route contain the same IP prefix in their respective NLRI
          fields, then the two routes are considered by the BGP best-path
          selection process to be comparable.
        </t>
        <t>
          <xref target="RFC6513"/> defines procedures for determining which
          of the UMH-eligible routes that match a particular C-root is to
          become the Selected UMH Route.  With one exception, these
          procedures are also applicable to GTM.  The one exception is the
          following.  Section 9.1.2 of <xref target="RFC6513"/> defines a
          particular method of choosing the Upstream PE, known as "Single
          Forwarder Selection" (SFS).  This procedure MUST NOT be used for
          GTM (see <xref target="sfs"/> for an explanation of why the SFS
          procedure cannot be applied to GTM).
        </t>
        <t>
          In GTM, the "Upstream RD" of a multicast flow is always considered
          to be zero and is NOT determined from the Selected UMH Route.
        </t>
        <t>
          The MVPN specifications require that when BGP is used for
          distributing multicast routing information, the UMH-eligible
          routes MUST carry the VRF Route Import EC and the Source AS EC.
          To determine the Upstream PE and Source AS for a particular
          multicast flow, the Upstream PE and Source AS are determined,
          respectively, from the VRF Route Import EC and the Source AS EC of
          the Selected UMH Route for that flow.  These ECs are generally
          attached to the UMH-eligible routes by the PEs that originate the
          routes.
        </t>
        <t>
          In GTM, there are certain situations in which it is allowable to
          omit the VRF Route Import EC and/or the Source AS EC from the
          UMH-eligible routes.  The following sub-sections specify the
          various options for determining the Upstream PBR and the Source AS
          in GTM.

          The procedures in <xref target="ECs"/> MUST be implemented.  The
          procedures in Sections <xref target="recursive" format="counter"
          /> and <xref target="non-bgp" format="counter" /> are OPTIONAL to

          may be useful in particular deployment scenarios, there is always
          the potential for interoperability problems when relying on
          OPTIONAL procedures.

            If the UMH-eligible routes have a SAFI of 1, 2, or 4, then they
            MAY carry the VRF Route Import EC and/or the Source AS EC.  If
            the Selected UMH Route is a route of SAFI 1, 2, or 4 that carries
            the VRF Route Import EC, then the Upstream PBR is determined
            from that EC.  Similarly, if the Selected UMH Route is a route
            of SAFI 1, 2, or 4 that carries the Source AS EC, the
            Source AS is determined from that EC.

          <t>
            When the procedure of this section is used, a PBR that
            distributes a UMH-eligible route to other PBRs is responsible
            for ensuring that the VRF Route Import and Source AS ECs are
            attached to it.

            If the selected UMH-eligible route has a SAFI of 1, 2, or 4 but

            Some service providers may consider it to be undesirable to have
            the PBRs put the VRF Route Import EC on all the UMH-eligible
            routes.  Or there may be deployment scenarios in which the
            UMH-eligible routes are not advertised by the PBRs at all.  The
            procedures described in this section provide an alternative that
            can be used under certain circumstances.
          </t>
          <t>
            The procedures in this section are OPTIONAL.
          </t>
          <t>
            In this alternative procedure, each PBR MUST originate a BGP
            route of SAFI 1, 2, or 4 whose NLRI is an IP address of the PBR
            itself.  This route MUST carry a VRF Route Import EC that
            identifies the PBR.  The address that appears in the Global
            Administrator field of that EC MUST be the same address that
            appears in the NLRI and in the Next Hop field of that route.
            This route MUST also carry a Source AS EC identifying the AS of
            the PBR.
          </t>
          <t>
            Whenever the PBR distributes a UMH-eligible route for which it
            sets itself as Next Hop, it MUST use this same IP address as the
            Next Hop of the UMH-eligible route that it used in the route
            discussed in the prior paragraph.
          </t>
          <t>
            When the procedure in this section is used and when a PBR is
            determining the Selected UMH Route for a given multicast flow,
            it may find that the Selected UMH Route has no VRF Route Import
            EC. In this case, the PBR will look up (in the global table) the
            route to the Next Hop of the Selected UMH Route.  If the route
            to the Next Hop has a VRF Route Import EC, that EC will be used
            to determine the Upstream PBR, just as if the EC had been
            attached to the Selected UMH Route.
          </t>
          <t>
            If recursive route resolution is required in order to resolve
            the Next Hop, the Upstream PBR will be determined from the first
            route with a VRF Route Import EC that is encountered during the
            recursive route resolution process.  (The recursive route
            resolution process itself is not modified by this document.)
          </t>
          <t>
            The same procedure can be applied to find the Source AS, except
            that the Source AS EC is used instead of the VRF Route Import
            EC.
          </t>


          <t>
            Note that this procedure is only applicable in scenarios where
            it is known that the Next Hop of the UMH-eligible routes is not
            changed by any router that participates in the distribution of
            those routes; this procedure MUST NOT be used in any scenario
            where the Next Hop may be changed between the time one PBR
            distributes the route and another PBR receives it.  The PBRs
            have no way of determining dynamically whether the procedure is
            applicable in a particular deployment; this must be made known
            to the PBRs by provisioning.

                The UMH-eligible routes are distributed among the PBRs by a

            Upstream PBR for a given multicast flow.

          <t>
            For example, suppose it is known that all the PBRs are in the
            same OSPF area.  It may be possible to determine the Upstream
            PBR for a given multicast flow by looking at the link state
            database to see which router is attached to the flow's C-root.
          </t>
          <t>
            As another example, suppose it is known that the set of PBRs is
            fully meshed via Traffic Engineering (TE) tunnels.  When a PBR
            looks up, in its global table, the C-root of a particular
            multicast flow, it may find that the next-hop interface is a
            particular TE tunnel.  If it can determine the identity of the
            router at the other end of that TE tunnel, it can deduce that
            the router is the Upstream PBR for that flow.

        <section title="Why SFS Does Not Apply to GTM" anchor="sfs">
          <t>
            To see why the SFS procedure cannot be applied to GTM, consider
            the following example scenario.  Suppose some multicast source S
            is homed to both PBR1 and PBR2, and suppose that both PBRs
            export a route (of SAFI 1, 2, or 4) whose NLRI is a prefix
            matching the address of S.  These two routes will be considered
            comparable by the BGP decision process.  A route reflector
            receiving both routes may thus choose to redistribute just one
            of the routes to S, the one chosen by the best-path algorithm.
            Different route reflectors may even choose different routes to
            redistribute (i.e., one route reflector may choose the route to
            S via PBR1 as the best path, while another chooses the route to S
            via PBR2 as the best path).  As a result, some PBRs may receive
            only the route to S via PBR1, and some may receive only the route
            to S via PBR2.  In that case, it is impossible to ensure that
            all PBRs will choose the same route to S.
          </t>
          <t>
            The SFS procedure works in VPN context as long as the following
            assumption holds: if S is homed to VRF-x in PE1 and to VRF-y in
            PE2, then VRF-x and VRF-y have been configured with different
            RDs.  In VPN context, the route to S is of SAFI 128 or 129 and
            thus has an RD in its NLRI.  So the route to S via PE1 will not
            have the same NLRI as the route to S via PE2.  As a result, all
            PEs will see both routes, and the PEs can implement a procedure
            that ensures that they all pick the same route to S.
          </t>
          <t>
            That is, the SFS procedure of <xref target="RFC6513"/> relies on
            the UMH-eligible routes being of SAFI 128 or 129 and relies on
            certain VRFs being configured with distinct RDs.  Thus, the
            procedure cannot be applied to GTM.
          </t>
          <t>
            One might think that the SFS procedure could be applied to GTM
            as long as the procedures defined in <xref target="ADD-PATH"/>
            are applied to the UMH-eligible routes.  Using the <xref
            target="ADD-PATH"/> procedures, the BGP speakers could advertise
            more than one path to a given prefix.  Typically, <xref
            target="ADD-PATH"/> is used to report the n best paths, for some
            small value of n.  However, this is not sufficient to support
            SFS, as can be seen by examining the following scenario:
          </t>

            <t>                
              In AS-X, PBR1 reports to both ASBR1 and ASBR3 that it has a
              route to S.  Similarly, PBR2 reports to both ASBR1 and ASBR3
              that it has a route to S.  Using the procedures in <xref target="ADD-PATH"/>,
              ASBR1 reports both routes to ASBR2, and ASBR3 reports both
              routes to ASBR4.  Now AS-Y sees 4 paths to S.  The AS-Z ASBRs
              will each see eight paths (four via ASBR2 and four via ASBR4).
              To avoid this explosion in the number of paths, a BGP speaker
              that uses <xref target="ADD-PATH"/> is usually considered to
              report only the n best paths.  However, there is then no
              guarantee that the reported set of paths will contain at least
              one path via PBR1 and at least one path via PBR2.  Without
              such a guarantee, the SFS procedure will not work.

          The MVPN specifications allow multicast flows to be carried on

          sent on an Inclusive Tunnel of a particular VPN, it is sent to all
          PEs in that VPN.  When sent on a Selective Tunnel of a particular

          This document allows the use of either Inclusive Tunnels or

          sending a multicast flow to ALL its PBRs would result in problems
          of scale.  


There are potentially many more PBRs for GTM than PEs
          for a particular VPN.  If the set of PBRs is large and growing,
          but most multicast flows do not need to go to all the PBRs, the

            To carry out the procedures specified in <xref
            target="RFC6514"/> (e.g., in Section 13.2 of that document), it
            is sometimes necessary for an egress PE to determine the ingress
            PE that originated a given Source Active A-D route. The
            procedure used in <xref target="RFC6514"/> to find the
            originator of a Source Active A-D route assumes that no two
            routes have the same RD unless they have been originated by the
            same PE.  However, this assumption is not valid in GTM, because
            each Source Active A-D route used for GTM will have an RD of 0,
            and all the UMH-eligible routes also have an RD of 0.  So GTM
            requires a different procedure for determining the originator of
            a Source Active A-D route.
          </t>
          <t>
            In GTM, the procedure for determining the originating PE of a
            Source Active A-D route is the following:
            <list style="symbols">

                    If the Source Active A-D route does carry the VRF

            If some site has receivers for a particular ASM group G, then it
            is possible (by the procedures of <xref target="RFC6514"/>) that
            every PBR attached to a site with a source for group G will
            originate a Source Active A-D route whose NLRI identifies that
            source and group.  These Source Active A-D routes may be
            distributed to every PBR.  If only a relatively small number of
            PBRs are actually interested in traffic from group G, but there
            are many sources for group G, this could result in a large
            number of (S,G) Source Active A-D routes being installed in a
            large number of PBRs that have no need of them.
          </t>
          <t>
            For GTM, it is possible to constrain the distribution of (S,G)
            Source Active A-D routes to those PBRs that are interested in
            GTM traffic to group G.  This can be done using the following
            OPTIONAL procedures:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>
                If a PBR originates a C-multicast Shared Tree Join whose
                NLRI contains (RD=0,*,G), then it dynamically creates an
                import RT for its global table, where the Global
                Administrator field of the RT contains the group address
                G, and the Local Administrator field contains zero.  (Note
                that an IPv6-address-specific RT would need to be used if
                the group address is an IPv6 address.)
              </t>
              <t>
                When a PBR creates such an import RT, it uses "RT
                Constraint" procedures <xref target="RFC4684"/> to advertise
                its interest in routes that carry this RT.
              </t>
              <t>
                When a PBR originates a Source Active A-D route from its
                global table, it attaches the RT described above.
              </t>
              <t>
                When the C-multicast Shared Tree Join is withdrawn, so is
                the corresponding RT constrain route, and the
                corresponding RT is removed as an import RT of its global
                table.
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            These procedures enable a PBR to automatically filter all
            Source Active A-D routes that are about multicast groups in
            which the PBR has no interest.
          </t>
          <t>
            This procedure does introduce the overhead of distributing
            additional "RT Constraint" routes and therefore may not be
            cost-effective in all scenarios, especially if the number of
            sources per ASM group is small.  This procedure may also result
            in increased join latency.

      <t>
        However, the GTM procedures of <xref target="RFC7524"/> are

      </t>
      <t>
        The two sets of procedures can co-exist in the same network, as long

      <t>
        Some of the major differences between the two sets of procedures are
        the following:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            The procedures for GTM described in
	    <xref target="RFC7524"/> do not
            use C-multicast Shared Tree Joins or C-multicast Source Tree
            Joins at all.  The procedures of this document use these
            C-multicast routes for GTM, setting the RD field of the NLRI to
            zero.
          </t>
          <t>
            The procedures for GTM described in <xref target="RFC7524"/> use Leaf
            A-D routes instead of C-multicast Shared/Source Tree Join
            routes.  Leaf A-D routes used in that manner can be
            distinguished from Leaf A-D routes used as specified in <xref
            target="RFC6514"/> by means of the NLRI format; <xref
            target="RFC7524"/> defines a new NLRI format for Leaf A-D
            routes.  Whether or not a given Leaf A-D route is being used according
            to the procedures described in <xref target="RFC7524"/> can be
            determined from its NLRI.  (See Section 6.2.2 ("Leaf A-D Route for Global Table

          </t>
          <t>
            The Leaf A-D routes used by the current document contain an NLRI
            that is in the format defined in <xref target="RFC6514"/>, NOT
            in the format as defined in <xref target="RFC7524"/>.
            The procedures assumed by this document for originating and
            processing Leaf A-D routes are as specified in <xref

          <t>
            The current document uses an RD value of zero in the NLRI in

            Table Multicast rather than a VPN multicast.  No other
            semantics are inferred from the fact that RD is zero.  <xref
            target="RFC7524"/> uses two different RD values in its
            GTM procedures, with semantic differences that depend upon the

          <t>
            In order for both sets of procedures to co-exist in the same

            set of procedures for that group address (i.e., for group G,

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
      <t>
        The security considerations of this document are primarily the
        security considerations of the base protocols, as discussed in <xref
        target="RFC6514"/>, <xref target="RFC4601"/>, and <xref
        target="RFC5294"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The protocols and procedures described in this document make use of
        a type of route (routes with the "MCAST-VPN" BGP SAFI) that was
        originally designed for use in VPN contexts only.  The protocols and
        procedures described in this document also make use of various BGP
        path attributes and extended communities (VRF Route Import Extended
        Community, Source AS Extended Community, and Route Target Extended
        Community) that were originally intended for use in VPN contexts.
        If these routes, attributes, and/or extended communities leak out
        into the wild, multicast data flows may be distributed in an
        unintended and/or unauthorized manner.
      </t>
      <t>
        When VPNs are provisioned, each VRF is configured with import RTs
        and export RTs. These RTs constrain the distribution and the import
        of the VPN routes, making it difficult to cause a route to be
        distributed to and imported by a VRF that is not authorized to
        import that route.  Additionally, VPN routes do not go into the
        "global table" with the "ordinary Internet routes" (i.e., non-VPN
        routes), and non-VPN routes do not impact the flow of multicast data
        within a VPN.  In GTM, some of these protections against improper
        distribution/import of the routes is lost -- import of the routes is
        not restricted to VRFs, and the RT infrastructure that controls the
        distribution of routes among the VRFs is not present when routes are
        exported from and imported into global tables.  
      </t>
      <t>
        Internet Service Providers often make extensive use of BGP extended
        communities, sometimes adding, deleting, and/or modifying a route's
        extended communities as the route is distributed throughout the
        network. Care should be taken to avoid deleting or modifying the VRF
        Route Import Extended Community and Source AS Extended Community.
        Incorrect manipulation of these extended communities may result in
        multicast streams being lost or misrouted.
      </t>
      <t>
        The procedures of this document require certain BGP routes to carry
        IP multicast group addresses.  Generally, such group addresses are
        only valid within a certain scope.  If a BGP route containing a
        group address is distributed outside the boundaries where the group
        address is meaningful, unauthorized distribution of multicast data
        flows may occur.
