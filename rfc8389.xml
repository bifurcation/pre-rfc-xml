    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E) <xref
      target="RFC7597"/> is a stateless, automatic tunneling mechanism for
      providing an IPv4 connectivity service to end users over a service
      provider's IPv6 network.</t>

      <t>This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
      (MIB) for use with monitoring MAP-E devices.</t>

      <t>For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
 Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 
      <xref target="RFC3410"/>.</t>

      <t>
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally accessed through
the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined
using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information
(SMI). This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which
is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 <xref target="RFC2578"/>, STD 58, RFC 2579
      <xref target="RFC2579"/> and STD 58, RFC 2580 <xref target="RFC2580"/>.</t>

    <section title="Terminology">
        <t>
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
    described in BCP&nbsp;14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> 
    when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
        </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Structure of the MIB Module">

      <t>The IF-MIB <xref target="RFC2863"/> defines generic managed
      objects for managing interfaces. Each logical interface (physical or
      virtual) has an ifEntry. Tunnels are handled by creating a logical
      interface (ifEntry) for each tunnel. Each MAP-E tunnel endpoint also
      acts as a virtual interface that has a corresponding entry in the
      IF-MIB. Those corresponding entries are indexed by ifIndex. The MAP-E
      MIB is configurable on a per-interface basis, so it depends on several
      parts (ifEntry) of the IF-MIB <xref target="RFC2863"> </xref>.</t>

      <section title="The mapMIBObjects">
        <section title="The mapRule Subtree">
          <t>The mapRule subtree describes managed objects used for managing
          the multiple mapping rules in MAP-E.</t>

          <t>According to <xref target="RFC7597"> </xref>, the mapping
          rules are divided into two categories: Basic Mapping Rule
          (BMR) and Forwarding Mapping Rule (FMR). According to
          Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC7598"/>, an F-flag
          specifies whether the rule is to be used for forwarding (FMR). If set,
          this rule is used as an FMR; if not set, this rule is BMR only and
          MUST NOT be used for forwarding. A BMR can also be used as an
          FMR for forwarding if the F-flag is set. So, the RuleType
          definition in the MAP-E MIB (see <xref target="defs"/>) defines
	  bmrAndfmr to
          specify this scenario.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="The mapSecurityCheck Subtree">

          <t>The mapSecurityCheck subtree provides statistics for the number
          of invalid packets that have been identified. <xref
	  target="RFC7597"/> defines two kinds of
          invalid packets:

<list style="symbols">
          <t>The Border Relay (BR) will validate the received packet's
          source IPv6 address against the configured MAP domain rule and the
          destination IPv6 address against the configured BR IPv6 address.</t>

          <t>The MAP node (Customer Edge (CE) and BR) will check that the
          received packet's source IPv4 address and port are in the range
          derived from the matching MAP rule.</t>
</list>
          </t>

        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="The mapMIBConformance Subtree">
        <t>The mapMIBConformance subtree provides conformance information of
        MIB objects.</t>

<!-- BEGIN DNE Text: MIB Security Boilerplate -->
      <t>
   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.
</t>

      <t>
   Some of the objects in this MIB module may be considered sensitive
   or vulnerable in some network environments.  This includes INDEX
   objects with a MAX-ACCESS of not-accessible, and any indices from
   other modules exposed via AUGMENTS.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:
</t>

<!-- END DNE Text: MIB Security Boilerplate -->

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>mapRuleIPv6Prefix</t>

          <t>mapRuleIPv6PrefixLen</t>

          <t>mapRuleIPv4Prefix</t>

          <t>mapRuleIPv4PrefixLen</t>

          <t>mapRuleBRIPv6Address</t>

          <t>mapRulePSID</t>

          <t>mapRulePSIDLen</t>

          <t>mapRuleOffset</t>

          <t>mapRuleEALen</t>

          <t>mapRuleType</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>Some of the MIB model's objects are vulnerable because the information
      that they hold may be used for targeting an attack against a MAP node
      (CE or BR). For example, an intruder could use the information to help deduce
      the customer IPv4 and IPv6 topologies and address-sharing ratios in use
      by the ISP.</t>

<!-- BEGIN DNE Text: MIB Security Boilerplate -->
<t>
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.
</t>

      <t>
   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the   
   SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"/>), and implementations
   claiming compliance 
   to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and 
   privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM) <xref target="RFC3414"/>
   with the AES cipher algorithm <xref target="RFC3826"/>. 
Implementations MAY also provide support for the
      Transport Security Model (TSM) <xref target="RFC5591"/> in combination
      with a secure transport such as SSH <xref target="RFC5592"/> or TLS/DTLS
      <xref target="RFC6353"/>.</t>

      <t>
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
