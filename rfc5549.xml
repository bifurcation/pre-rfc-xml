    <abstract>
      <t>Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the set of network-layer
      protocols to which the address carried in the Next Hop field may belong
      is determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the Subsequent
      Address Family Identifier (SAFI). The current AFI/SAFI definitions for
      the IPv4 address family only have provisions for advertising a Next Hop
      address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol when advertising IPv4
      Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) or VPN-IPv4 NLRI. This
      document specifies the extensions necessary to allow advertising IPv4
      NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv6
      protocol. This comprises an extension of the AFI/SAFI definitions to
      allow the address of the Next Hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to
      also belong to the IPv6 protocol, the encoding of the Next Hop in order
      to determine which of the protocols the address actually belongs to, and
      a new BGP Capability allowing MP-BGP Peers to dynamically discover
      whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 Next
      Hop.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) <xref target="RFC4760"></xref> specifies
      that the set of network-layer protocols to which the address carried in
      the Next Hop field may belong is determined by the Address Family
      Identifier (AFI) and the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI). A
      number of existing AFI/SAFIs allow the Next Hop address to belong to a
      different address family than the Network Layer Reachability Information
      (NLRI). For example, the AFI/SAFI &lt;25/65&gt; used (as per <xref
      target="L2VPN-SIG"></xref>) in order to perform L2VPN
      auto-discovery, allows advertising NLRI that contains the identifier of a
      Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) instance or that identifies a particular pool of attachment circuits
      at a given Provider Edge (PE), while the Next Hop field contains the
      loopback address of a PE. Similarly, the AFI/SAFI &lt;1/132&gt; (defined
      in <xref target="RFC4684"></xref>) in order to advertise Route Target
      (RT) membership information, allows advertising NLRI that contains such
      RT membership information, while the Next Hop field contains the address
      of the advertising router.</t>

      <t>Furthermore, a number of these existing AFI/SAFIs allow the Next Hop
      to belong to either the IPv4 Network Layer Protocol or the IPv6 Network
      Layer Protocol, and specify the encoding of the Next Hop information in
      order to determine which of the protocols the address actually belongs
      to. For example, <xref target="RFC4684"></xref> allows the Next Hop
      address to be either IPv4 or IPv6 and states that the Next Hop field
      address shall be interpreted as an IPv4 address whenever the length of
      Next Hop address is 4 octets, and as an IPv6 address whenever the length
      of the Next Hop address is 16 octets.</t>

      <t>There are situations such as those described in <xref
      target="RFC4925"></xref> and in <xref
      target="MESH-FMWK"></xref> where carriers (or
      large enterprise networks acting as carrier for their internal
      resources) may be required to establish connectivity between 'islands'
      of networks of one address family type across a transit core of a
      differing address family type. This includes both the case of IPv6
      islands across an IPv4 core and the case of IPv4 islands across an IPv6
      core. Where Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) is used to advertise the
      corresponding reachability information, this translates into the
      requirement for a BGP speaker to advertise Network Layer Reachability
      Information (NLRI) of a given address family via a Next Hop of a
      different address family (i.e., IPv6 NLRI with IPv4 Next Hop and IPv4
      NLRI with IPv6 Next Hop).</t>

      <t>The current AFI/SAFI definitions for the IPv6 address family assume
      that the Next Hop address belongs to the IPv6 address family type.
      Specifically, as per <xref target="RFC2545"></xref> and <xref
      target="RFC3107"></xref>, when the &lt;AFI/SAFI&gt; is &lt;2/1&gt;,
      &lt;2/2&gt;, or &lt;2/4&gt;, the Next Hop address is assumed to be of
      IPv6 type. As per <xref target="RFC4659"></xref>, when the
      &lt;AFI/SAFI&gt; is &lt;2/128&gt;, the Next Hop address is assumed to be
      of IPv6-VPN type.</t>

      <t>However, <xref target="RFC4798"></xref> and <xref
      target="RFC4659"></xref> specify how an IPv4 address can be encoded
      inside the Next Hop IPv6 address field when IPv6 NLRI needs to be
      advertised with an IPv4 Next Hop. <xref target="RFC4798"></xref> defines
      how the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address format specified in the IPv6 addressing
      architecture (<xref target="RFC4291"></xref>) can be used for that
      purpose when the &lt;AFI/SAFI&gt; is &lt;2/1&gt;, &lt;2/2&gt;, or
      &lt;2/4&gt;. <xref target="RFC4659"></xref> defines how the IPv4-mapped
      IPv6 address format as well as a null Route Distinguisher can be used
      for that purpose when the &lt;AFI/SAFI&gt; is &lt;2/128&gt;. Thus, there
      are existing solutions for the advertisement of IPv6 NLRI with an IPv4
      Next Hop.</t>

      <t>Similarly, the current AFI/SAFI definitions for advertisement of IPv4
      NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI assume that the Next Hop address belongs to the
      IPv4 address family type. Specifically, as per <xref
      target="RFC4760"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3107"></xref>, when the
      &lt;AFI/SAFI&gt; is &lt;1/1&gt;, &lt;1/2&gt;, or &lt;1/4&gt;, the Next
      Hop address is assumed to be of IPv4 type. As per <xref
      target="RFC4364"></xref>, when the &lt;AFI/SAFI&gt; is &lt;1/128&gt;,
      the Next Hop address is assumed to be of VPN-IPv4 type. There is clearly
      no generally applicable method for encoding an IPv6 address inside the
      IPv4 address field of the Next Hop. &nbsp;Hence, there is currently no
      specified solution for advertising IPv4 or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6
      Next Hop.</t>

      <t>This document specifies the extensions necessary to do so. This
      comprises an extension of the AFI/SAFI definitions to allow the address
      of the Next Hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to belong to either
      the IPv4 or the IPv6 protocol, the encoding of the Next Hop information
      in order to determine which of the protocols the address actually
      belongs to, and a new BGP Capability allowing MP-BGP peers to
      dynamically discover whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4
      NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop. The new BGP Capability allows gradual
      deployment of the new functionality of advertising IPv4 reachability via
      an IPv6 Next Hop, without any flag day nor any risk of traffic
      black-holing.</t>

    <section title="Extension of AFI/SAFI Definitions for the IPv4
      Address Family" anchor="sec_extension">
      <t>As mentioned earlier, MP-BGP specifies that the set of network-layer
      protocols to which the address carried in the Next Hop field may belong
      is determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the Subsequent
      Address Family Identifier (SAFI). The following current AFI/SAFI
      definitions for the IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI (&lt;1/1&gt;,
      &lt;1/2&gt;, &lt;1/4&gt;, and &lt;1/128&gt;) only have provisions for
      advertising a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol. This
      document extends the definition of the AFI/SAFI for advertisement of
      IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI to extend the set of network-layer
      protocols
      to which the Next Hop address can belong, to include IPv6 in addition to
      IPv4.</t>

      <t>Specifically, this document allows advertising with <xref
      target="RFC4760"></xref> of an MP_REACH_NLRI with:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>AFI = 1</t>

          <t>SAFI = 1, 2, 4, or 128</t>

          <t>Length of Next Hop Address = 16 or 32</t>

          <t>Next Hop Address = IPv6 address of next hop (potentially followed
          by the link-local IPv6 address of the next hop). This field is to be
          constructed as per Section 3 of <xref target="RFC2545"></xref>.</t>

          <t>NLRI= NLRI as per current AFI/SAFI definition</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This is in addition to the current mode of operation allowing
      advertisement of NLRI for &lt;AFI/SAFI&gt; of &lt;1/1&gt;,
      &lt;1/2&gt; and &lt;1/4&gt; with a next hop address of IPv4 type and
      advertisement of NLRI for &lt;AFI/SAFI&gt; of &lt;1/128&gt; with a
      next hop address of VPN-IPv4 type.</t>

      <t>The BGP speaker receiving the advertisement MUST use the Length of
      Next Hop Address field to determine which network-layer protocol the
      next hop address belongs to. When the Length of Next Hop Address field
      is equal to 16 or 32, the next hop address is of type IPv6. Note that
      this method of using the Length of the Next Hop Address field to
      determine which network-layer protocol the next hop address belongs to
      (out of the set of protocols allowed by the AFI/SAFI definition) is the
      same as used in <xref target="RFC4684"></xref> and <xref
      target="L2VPN-SIG"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Use of BGP Capability Advertisement"
      anchor="sec_use">

      <t><xref target="RFC5492"></xref> defines a mechanism to allow two BGP
      speakers to discover if a particular capability is supported by their
      BGP peer and thus whether it can be used with that peer. This document
      defines a new capability that can be advertised using <xref
      target="RFC5492"></xref> and that is referred to as the Extended Next
      Hop Encoding capability. This capability allows BGP speakers to discover
      whether, for a given NLRI &lt;AFI/SAFI&gt;, a peer supports
      advertisement with a next hop whose network protocol is determined by
      the value of the Length of Next Hop Address field, as specified in
      <xref target="sec_extension"/>.</t>

      <t>A BGP speaker that wishes to advertise to a BGP peer an IPv6 Next Hop
      for IPv4 NLRI or for VPN-IPv4 NLRI as per this specification MUST
      use the Capability Advertisement procedures defined in <xref
      target="RFC5492"></xref> with the Extended Next Hop Encoding Capability
      to establish whether its peer supports this for the NLRI AFI/SAFI
      pair(s) of interest. The fields in the Capabilities Optional Parameter
      MUST be set as follows:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The Capability Code field MUST be set to 5 (which
          indicates the Extended Next Hop Encoding
          capability).</t>

          <t>The Capability Length field is set to a variable value that is
          the length of the Capability Value field (which follows).</t>

          <t>The Capability Value field has the following format:</t>

              <t>each triple &lt;NLRI AFI, NLRI SAFI, Nexthop AFI&gt;
              indicates that NLRI of &lt;NLRI AFI / NLRI SAFI&gt; may be advertised
              with a Next Hop address belonging to the network-layer protocol
              of Nexthop AFI.</t>

              <t>the AFI and SAFI values are defined in the Address Family

        </list></t>

      <t>Since this document only concerns itself with the advertisement of
      IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop, this specification
      only allows the following values in the Capability Value field of the
      Extended Next Hop Encoding capability:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>NLRI AFI = 1 (IPv4)</t>

          <t>NLRI SAFI = 1, 2, 4, or 128</t>

          <t>Nexthop AFI = 2 (IPv6)</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This specification does not propose that the Extended Next Hop
      Encoding capability be used with any other combinations of &lt;NLRI AFI,
      NLRI SAFI, Nexthop AFI&gt;. In particular, this specification does not
      propose that the Extended Next Hop Encoding capability be used for NLRI
      AFI/SAFIs whose definition already allows use of both IPv4 and IPv6 next
      hops (e.g., AFI/SAFI = &lt;1/132&gt; as defined in <xref target="RFC4684"></xref>).
      Similarly, it does not propose that the Extended Next Hop Encoding
      capability be used for NLRI AFI/SAFIs for which there is already a
      solution for advertising a next hop of a different address family (e.g.,
      AFI/SAFI = &lt;2/1&gt;, &lt;2/2&gt;, or &lt;2/4&gt; with IPv4 Next Hop as per <xref
      target="RFC4798"></xref> and AFI/SAFI = &lt;2/128&gt; with IPv4 Next Hop as per
      <xref target="RFC4659"></xref>).</t>

      <t>It is expected that if new AFI/SAFIs are defined in the future, their
      definition will have provisions (where appropriate) for both IPv4 and
      IPv6 Next Hops from the onset, with determination based on Length of
      Next Hop Address field. Thus, new AFI/SAFIs are not expected to make use
      of the Extended Next Hop Encoding capability.</t>

      <t>A BGP speaker MUST only advertise to a BGP peer the IPv4 or VPN-IPv4
      NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop if the BGP speaker has first ascertained via
      BGP Capability Advertisement that the BGP peer supports the Extended
      Next Hop Encoding capability for the relevant AFI/SAFI pair.</t>

      <t>The Extended Next Hop Encoding capability provides information about
      next hop encoding for a given AFI/SAFI, assuming that AFI/SAFI is
      allowed. It does not influence whether that AFI/SAFI is indeed allowed.
      Whether a AFI/SAFI can be used between the BGP peers is purely
      determined through the Multiprotocol Extensions capability defined in
      <xref target="RFC4760"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The Extended Next Hop Encoding capability MAY be dynamically updated
      through the use of the Dynamic Capability capability and associated
      mechanisms defined in <xref
      target="DYN-CAP"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Operations">
      <t>By default, if a particular BGP session is running over IPvx (where
      IPvx is IPv4 or IPv6), and if the BGP speaker sending an update is
      putting its own address in as the next hop, then the next hop address
      SHOULD be specified as an IPvx address, using the encoding rules
      specified in the AFI/SAFI definition of the NLRI being updated. This
      default behavior may be overridden by policy.</t>

      <t>When a next hop address needs to be passed along unchanged
      (e.g., as a Route Reflector (RR) would do), its encoding MUST
      NOT be changed. If a particular RR client cannot handle that
      encoding (as determined by the BGP Capability Advertisement),
      then the NLRI in question cannot be distributed to that
      client. For sound routing in certain scenarios, this will
      require that all the RR clients be able to handle whatever
      encodings any of them may generate.</t>
