                <t> This experimental specification proposes a modification
                    to DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) allowing
                    advertisement of third-party signature authorizations
                    that are to be interpreted as equivalent to a signature
                    added by the administrative domain of the message's
                    author. </t>
        </abstract>

        <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
                <t> <xref target="DKIM"/> defines a mechanism for transparent
                    domain-level signing of messages for the purpose of
                    declaring that a particular ADministrative Management
                    Domain
                    (ADMD) takes some responsibility for a message.  </t>

                <t> DKIM, however, deliberately makes no binding between the
                    DNS domain of the Signer and any other identity found in
                    the message.  Despite this, there is an automatic human
                    perception that an Author Domain Signature (one for which
                    the RFC5322.From domain matches the DNS domain of the
                    Signer) is more valuable or trustworthy than any
                    other. </t>

                <t> To enable a third party to apply DKIM signatures
                    to messages, the DKIM specification suggests
                    delegation to a third party of either subdomains or
                    private keys, so that the third party can add DKIM
                    signatures that appear to have been added by the Author
                    ADMD.  Absent is a protocol by which an Author ADMD can
                    announce that messages bearing specific valid DKIM
                    signatures on its mail, which are added by other ADMDs,
                    are to be treated as if they were signed by the Author
                    ADMD itself.  This memo presents an experimental mechanism
                    for doing so, called Authorized Third-Party Signatures
                    (ATPS). </t>

                <t> ATPS augments the semantics of DKIM by providing to
                    the Verifier multiple identifiers rather than one.
                    Specifically, it validates the identifier found in the
                    DKIM signature, and then provides the RFC5322.From domain
                    for evaluation. </t>

                <t> This memo also registers, per <xref target="AUTHRES"/>,
                    the means to indicate to agents downstream of the Verifier
                    that a third-party signature verification occurred. </t>

        <section anchor="discuss" title="Roles and Scope">
                <t> The context of this protocol involves the following
                    roles: 

                    <list style="symbols">
                        <t> ADministrative Management Domains (ADMDs),
                            whose DNS
                            domain name(s) appear in the RFC5322.From field
                            of a <xref target="MAIL"/> message; </t>

                        <t> ATPS Signers, which apply <xref target="DKIM"/>
                            signatures using their own domains, but on behalf
                            of the message Author's ADMD; and </t>

                        <t> the Verifier, who implements the signature
                            validation procedures described in
                            <xref target="DKIM"/>. </t>
                    </list></t>

                <t> An ADMD implements this protocol if it wishes to announce
                    that a signature from any in a set of specified DNS domains
                    is to be considered equivalent to one from the ADMD itself.
                    For example, an ADMD might wish to delegate signing
                    authority
                    for its DNS domain to an approved messaging service
                    provider without doing the work of key transfer described
                    in Appendix B.1.1 of <xref target="DKIM"/>. An authorized
                    ATPS Signer makes a claim of this relationship via new tags
                    in the DKIM signature, and the ADMD confirms this claim
                    by publishing a specific TXT record in its DNS. </t>

                <t> A Verifier implements this protocol if it wishes
                    to ensure that a message bears one or more signatures
                    from sources authorized to sign mail on behalf of the
                    ADMD, and identify for special treatment mail
                    that meets (or does not meet) that criterion.  It
                    will do so by treating the Signer's authorization on
                    behalf of the Author's ADMD to mean that the Signer's
                    signature is equivalent to one affixed by the
                    Author's ADMD. </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="formats" title="Queries and Replies">
                <t> This section describes in detail the queries issued,
                    the replies received, and how they should be interpreted
                    and applied. </t>

                <section anchor="hashes" title="Hash Selection">
                        <t> The Author's ADMD will indicate authorization
                            of a third party to sign its mail via the presence
                            of a DNS TXT record that contains an encoding
                            of the third party's DNS domain name.  There are
                            two supported methods for doing so -- one that
                            involves a plain copy of the third party's DNS
                            domain name, and one that involves an encoded
                            version of the name.  The encoding mechanism is
                            provided so that any domain name can be added to
                            the DNS in a fixed length, so that longer
                            third-party domain names are not excluded from
                            participation because of the overall length limit
                            on a DNS query. </t>

                        <t> If selected, the encoding mechanism requires
                            constructing a digest of the third party's DNS
                            domain name.  The Author ADMD MUST select a
                            digest ("hash") method currently supported by
                            DKIM (see Section 7.7 of <xref target="DKIM"/>),
                            and this selection needs to be communicated to the
                            ATPS Signer, as it is used in generation of the
                            third-party signatures. </t>

                        <t> Where the encoding mechanism is not used, the
                            ATPS Signer MUST use a hash name of "none". </t>
                            
                        <t> The full DNS mechanism is specified in
                            <xref target="query"/>. </t>

                <section anchor="dkim-ext" title="Extension to DKIM">
                        <t> <xref target="DKIM"/> signatures contain a
                            "tag=value" sequence.  This protocol will add
                            additional tags called "atps" and "atpsh". </t>

                        <t> When the ATPS Signer generates a DKIM signature for
                            another ADMD, it MUST put its own domain in the
                            signature's "d" tag, and include an "atps" tag that
                            has as its value the domain name of the ADMD on
                            whose behalf it is signing. </t>

                        <t> The tag name that carries the name of the selected
                            hash algorithm is "atpsh".  This tag MUST also be
                            included, as it is required as part of the
                            algorithm that will be enacted by the
                            Verifier. </t>

                        <t> The formal syntax definition, per
                            <xref target="ABNF"/>, is as follows:

                                </artwork></figure></t>

                        <t> "domain-name" and "key-h-tag-alg" are defined in

                            names are to be encoded as A-labels, as
                            described in Section 2.3 of
                            <xref target="IDNA"/>. </t>

                            considered acceptable to the Verifier according to
                            any local policy requirements (which are not
                            discussed here or in <xref target="DKIM"/>), the
                            Verifier compares the domain name in the value
                            of that tag with the one found in the RFC5322.From
                            field of the message.  The match MUST be done in

                                an ATPS Signer.  This is included to assist
                                with collision detections; for example, if

                                same as the base32 portion of the query, or
                                more simply if this name is not the same as
                                that found in the "atps" tag, a hash collision
                                could have occurred.  Its use where no name
                                hashing has occurred is redundant.

                <t> For each DKIM signature that verifies (see Section 6
                    of <xref target="DKIM"/>), if a Verifier succeeds in
                    confirming that the Author's ADMD authorized the ATPS
                    Signer using this protocol, then the Verifier SHOULD
                    evaluate the message as though it contained a valid

                <t> This assertion is based on the fact that the ADMD

                <t> A Verifier implementing both Author Domain Signing
                    Practices (ADSP) and ATPS MUST test
                    ATPS first.  If ATPS indicates a valid delegation, the
                    Verifier MUST act, with respect to ADSP, as though the
                    message has a valid Author Domain Signature (because
                    that's what the delegation means), and no ADSP test is

        <section anchor="exp" title="Experiment Process">
                <t> The working group that developed DKIM considered a
                    third-party mechanism such as this one to be
                    controversial, in terms of need and practicality, and
                    decided that an alternative mechanism was sufficient.
                    However, this was not based on actual experience,
                    as there is no specific history on this question.  Thus,
                    this experiment was devised. </t>

                <t> The experimental protocol described here has been
                    implemented as an extension to DKIM in two software
                    products, one of which is open source and seeing
                    increasingly wide use.  It is included there to allow
                    customers of those systems to make use of it if they
                    believe such third-party assertions are useful to the
                    overall DKIM mechanism.  Further adoption as part of
                    the experiment is welcome and encouraged. </t>

                <t> Use of the protocol and anecdotes of how it affects the
                    overall DKIM experience will be collected by those
                    implementers and the author of this memo.  Those
                    participating in the experiment are also advised to
                    observe and report the impact of what is discussed in
                    <xref target="dns_load"/>, especially with respect to
                    MTA latency that may be introduced. </t>

                <t> If the response is substantial and positive, advancement
                    along the Standards Track might be warranted. </t>

                            (see <xref target="hashes"/>) has security
                            implications, as weaker algorithms have more risk
                            of collision, meaning a second DNS domain name
                            could in theory be constructed to appear to have
                            been authorized by the Author ADMD. </t>

                        <t> At the time of publication of
                            <xref target="DKIM"/>, use of SHA256 was preferred
                            over SHA1 for this reason, though support for both
                            has been maintained.  See Section 3.3 of
                            <xref target="DKIM"/> for additional
                            discussion. </t>

                         title="False Privacy">
                        <t> The fact that the authorized third-party domain
                            name is hashed and then encoded with base32 might
                            give some the false sense that the relationship
                            between the two parties is somehow protected.
                            This is not the case.  Indeed, the very purpose
                            of this protocol is to make it possible for such
                            relationships to be discovered, so such an
                            obscuration would make that process more difficult
                            without a shared secret delivered out-of-band
                            to message verifiers (which also adds further
                            complexity).  Rather, the hash and encode steps
                            are done merely to convert any third-party
                            domain name to a fixed width in the construction
                            of the DNS query. </t>

                            to the risk that the third-party Signer
                            becomes compromised and then begins to sign
                            malicious or nuisance messages on behalf of the
                            ADMD.  This can obviously reflect
                            negatively on the ADMD, and the impact of
                            this can become more severe as automated domain
                            reputation systems are developed and deployed.
                            Thorough vetting and monitoring practices by
                            ADMDs of third-party Signers will likely
                            need to become the norm. </t>

                        <t> A Verifier participating in DKIM, ADSP, and ATPS
                            will now issue a number of TXT queries to the
                            DNS equal to as many as one (for the ADSP query)
                            plus the number of signatures on the message
                            (one for each key that is to be verified) plus
                            the number of signatures that validated and that also
                            bear an "atps" tag.

  This is in addition to
                            any PTR and A queries the MTA might issue at the
                            time the actual message relaying or delivery
                            is initiated.  Obviously, this can be burdensome
                            on the DNS at both ends, and waiting for that
                            number of queries to return when they are issued
                            in parallel could trigger timeouts in the MTA. </t>

                        <t> An alternative that has not yet been 
                            explored is the storage of the ATPS data at a
                            specific URL tied to the Author's domain name.
                            This would alleviate pressure on the DNS at the
                            expense of requiring the ADMD to operate a
                            web server (which has its own security
                            implications) and the addition of the establishment
                            of a TCP connection.  Moreover, the Verifier
                            would be well advised to implement caching
                            of this data to prevent ATPS from being used
                            as a denial-of-service vector. </t>

                <t> This section presents an example of the use of this
                    protocol to query for a third-party authorization and
                    discusses the interpretation of the result. </t>

                <t> Presume a message for which the RFC5322.From domain is
                    "example.com", and it bears two valid signatures,
                    from "one.example.net" and from "two.example.net",
                    each with an "atps" tag whose value is "example.com",
                    and an "atpsh" tag whose value is "sha1".  The following
                    actions are taken:

                    <list style="numbers">
                        <t> A SHA1 hash of "one.example.net" is computed
                            and then converted to printable form using base32
                            encoding, resulting in the string
                            "QSP4I4D24CRHOPDZ3O3ZIU2KSGS3X6Z6". </t>

                        <t> A TXT query is issued to
                            "QSP4I4D24CRHOPDZ3O3ZIU2KSGS3X6Z6._atps.example.com". </t>

                        <t> If a valid reply arrives, the algorithm stops with
                            <xref target="AUTHRES"/> result "pass".  If
                            a DNS error code other than NXDOMAIN is returned,
                            the algorithm stops with a result of
                            "temperror" or "permerror" as appropriate. </t>

                        <t> A SHA1 hash of "two.example.net" is computed
                            and then converted to printable form using base32

                        <t> A TXT query is issued to
                            "ZTZGRRV3F45A4U6HLDKBF3ZCOW4V2AJX._atps.example.com". </t>

        <section anchor="rrtype" title="Choice of DNS RR Type">
                <t> It was proposed that this work appear within the DNS
                    under a new Resource Record (RR) Type.  Although this
                    is possibly an appropriate thing to do, consideration
                    was also given to the fact that major portions of DKIM
                    already use an ASCII-based "tag=value" syntax, and 
                    store key and ADSP data in the DNS using TXT resource
                    records.  To enable re-use of existing DKIM code, it was
                    decided to re-use the TXT message scheme. </t>
