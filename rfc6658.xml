    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a pseudowire mechanism that is used to
      transport a packet service over an MPLS PSN in the case where the client
      Label Switching Router (LSR) and the server Provider Edge equipments are
      co-resident in the same equipment. This pseudowire mechanism may be used
      to carry all of the required layer 2 and layer 3 protocols between the
      pair of client LSRs.</t>

    <section title="Introduction ">
      <t>There is a need to provide a method of carrying a packet service over
      an MPLS PSN in a way that provides isolation between the two networks.
      The server MPLS network may be an MPLS network or a network conforming
      to the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) <xref target="RFC5317"></xref>.
      The client may also be either an MPLS network or a network conforming to
      the MPLS-TP. Considerations regarding the use of an MPLS network as a
      server for an MPLS-TP network are outside the scope of this
      document.</t>

      <t>Where the client equipment is connected to the server equipment via a
      physical interface, the same data-link type must be used to attach the
      clients to the Provider Edge (PE) equipments, and a pseudowire (PW) of
      the same type as the data-link must be used <xref
      target="RFC3985"></xref>. The reason that interworking between
      different physical and data-link attachment types is specifically
      disallowed in the pseudowire architecture is because this is a complex
      task and not a simple bit-mapping exercise. The interworking is not
      limited to the physical and data-link interfaces and the state-machines.
      It also requires a compatible approach to the formation of the
      adjacencies between attached client network equipment. As an example, the
      reader should consider the differences between router adjacency
      formation on a point-to-point link compared to a
      multipoint-to-multipoint interface (e.g., Ethernet).</t>

      <t>A further consideration is that two adjacent MPLS Label Switching
      Routers (LSRs) do not simply exchange MPLS packets. They exchange IP
      packets for adjacency formation, control, routing, label exchange,
      management, and monitoring purposes. In addition, they may exchange
      data-link packets as part of routing (e.g., IS-IS Hellos and IS-IS Link
      State Packets) and for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)
      purposes such as the Link-Layer Discovery Protocol 
      <xref target="IEEE.802.1AB.2009"></xref>. 
      Thus, the two clients require an attachment mechanism that
      can be used to multiplex a number of protocols. In addition, it is
      essential to the correct operation of the network layer that all of
      these protocols fate share.</t>

      <t>Where the client LSR and server PE are co-located in the same
      equipment, the data-link layer can be simplified to a point-to-point
      Ethernet used to multiplex the various data-link types onto a
      pseudowire. This is the method described in this document.</t>

      <t> <xref target="ApdxA"></xref> provides information on alternative
      approaches to providing a packet PW that were considered by the PWE3 Working
      Group and the reasons for using the method defined in this
      specification.</t>

      <t>In this model, the LSRs (LSR1 and LSR2) are part of the client MPLS PSN.
      The PEs (PE1 and PE2) are part of the server PSN that is to be used to
      provide connectivity between the client LSRs. The attachment circuit
      that is used to connect the MPLS LSRs to the PEs is a virtual interface
      within the equipment. A packet pseudowire is used to provide
      connectivity between these virtual interfaces. This packet pseudowire is
      used to transport all of the required layer 2 and layer 3
      protocols between LSR1 and LSR2.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Client Network-Layer Model">
      <t>The packet PW appears as a single point-to-point link to the client
      layer. Network-layer adjacency formation and maintenance between the
      client equipments will follow the normal practice needed to support the
      required relationship in the client layer. The assignment of metrics for
      this point-to-point link is a matter for the client layer. In a
hop-by-hop 
routing network, the metrics would normally be assigned by
      appropriate configuration of the embedded client network-layer equipment
      (e.g., the embedded client LSR). Where the client was using the packet PW
      as part of a traffic-engineered path, it is up to the operator of the
      client network to ensure that the server-layer operator provides the
      necessary service-level agreement.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Forwarding Model">
      <t>The packet PW forwarding model is illustrated in <xref
      target="fwd-model"></xref>. The forwarding operation can be likened to a
      virtual private network (VPN), in which a forwarding decision is first
      taken at the client layer, an encapsulation is applied, and then a second
      forwarding decision is taken at the server layer.</t>

      <t>A packet PW PE comprises three components: the client LSR, a PW
      processor, and a server LSR. Note that <xref target="RFC3985"></xref>
      does not formally indicate the presence of the server LSR because it
      does not concern itself with the server layer. However it is useful in
      this document to recognize that the server LSR exists.</t>

      <t>It may be useful to first recall the operation of a layer 2 PW such
      as an Ethernet PW <xref target="RFC4448"></xref> within this model. The
      client LSR is not present, and packets arrive directly on the attachment
      circuit (AC) that is part of the client network. The PW function
      undertakes any header processing, if configured to do so; it then
      optionally pushes the PW control word (CW) and finally pushes the PW
      label. The PW function then passes the packet to the LSR function, which
      pushes the label needed to reach the egress PE and forwards the packet
      to the next hop in the server network. At the egress PE, the packet
      typically arrives with the PW label at the top of the stack; the packet is thus
      directed to the correct PW instance. The PW instance performs any
      required reconstruction using, if necessary, the CW, and the packet is
      sent directly to the attachment circuit.</t>

      <t>Now let us consider the case of client-layer MPLS traffic being carried
      over a packet PW. An LSR belonging to the client layer is embedded
      within the PE equipment. This is a type of native service processing
      element <xref target="RFC3985"></xref>. The client LSR determines the
      next hop in the client layer, and pushes the label needed by the next
      hop in the client layer. It then encapsulates the packet in an Ethernet
      header setting the Ethertype to MPLS, and the client LSR passes the
      packet to the correct PW instance. The PW instance then proceeds as
      defined for an Ethernet PW <xref target="RFC4448"></xref> by optionally pushing the control
      word, then pushing the PW label, and finally handing the packet to the
      server-layer LSR for delivery to the egress PE in the server layer.</t>

      <t>At the egress PE in the server layer, the packet is first processed
      by the server LSR, which uses the PW label to pass the packet to the
      correct PW instance. This PW instance processes the packet as described
      in <xref target="RFC4448"></xref>. The resultant Ethernet encapsulated client packet is then
      passed to the egress client LSR, which then processes the packet in the
      normal manner.</t>

      <t>Note that although the description above is written in terms of the
      behavior of an MPLS LSR, the processing model would be similar for an
      IP packet or any other protocol type.</t>

      <t>Note that the semantics of the PW between the client LSRs is a
      point-to-point link.</t>

      <t>This conforms to the PW protocols stack as defined in <xref
      target="RFC4448"></xref>. The protocol stack is unremarkable except to
      note that the stack does not retain 32-bit alignment between the virtual
      Ethernet header and the PW optional control word (or the PW label when
      the optional components are not present in the PW header). This loss of
      32 bits of alignment is necessary to preserve backwards compatibility
      with the Ethernet PW design <xref target="RFC4448"></xref></t>

      <t>Ethernet Raw Mode (PW type 5) MUST be used for the packet PW.</t>

      signaling is used to set up the PW, the LDP peers numerically compare
      their IP addresses. The LDP PE with the higher-value IP address will use
      PacketPWEthA, whilst the LDP peer with the lower-value IP address uses
      PacketPWEthB.</t>

      <t>Where no signaling PW protocol is used, suitable Ethernet addresses
      MUST be configured at each PE.</t>

      <t>Although this PW represents a point-to-point connection, the use of a
      multicast destination address in the Ethernet encapsulation is REQUIRED
      by some client-layer protocols. Peers MUST be prepared to handle a
      multicast destination address in the Ethernet encapsulation.</t>

      <t>The use of Ethernet as the encapsulation mechanism for traffic

      multiplexing capability. Thus, for example, a server LSR is not required
      to implement the Ethernet OAM.</t>

    <section anchor="ApdxA" title="Encapsulation Approaches Considered">
      <t>A number of approaches to the design of a packet pseudowire (PW) were
      investigated by the PWE3 Working Group and were discussed in IETF
      meetings and on the PWE3 list. This section describes the approaches
      that were analyzed and the technical issues that the authors took into
      consideration in arriving at the approach described in the main body of
      this document. This appendix is provided so that engineers considering
      alternative optimizations can have access to the rationale for the
      selection of the approach described in this document.</t>



      <t>In a typical network, there are usually no more that four
network-layer 
protocols that need to be supported: IPv4, IPv6, MPLS, and
Connectionless Network Service (CLNS).
      However, any solution needs to be scalable to a larger number of
      protocols. The approaches considered in this appendix all satisfy this
      minimum requirement but vary in their ability to support larger numbers
      of network-layer protocols.</t>




      <t>
Additionally, it is beneficial if the complete set of protocols
carried over the network in support of a set of CE peers fate
share.
It is additionally beneficial if a single OAM session can be used
      to monitor the behavior of this complete set. During the investigation,
      various views were expressed as to where these benefits lay on the scale
      from absolutely
      required to "nice to have", but in the end, they were
      not a factor in reaching our conclusion.</t>

      <t>Four candidate approaches were analyzed:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">

      <section title="A Protocol Identifier in the Control Word">


        <t>
   In this approach, a Protocol Identifier (PID) is included in
   the PW control word (CW) by appending it to the generic control word
   <xref target="RFC4385"></xref> to make a 6-byte CW (it was thought that this approach 
   would include 2 reserved bytes to provide 32-bit alignment, but then 
   this was optimized out).
A variant of this is just
        to use a 2-byte PID without a control word.</t>

        <t>This is a simple approach and is basically a virtual PPP interface
        without the PPP control protocol. This has a smaller MTU than, for
        example, a virtual Ethernet would need; however, in forwarding terms, it
        is not as simple as the PID label or multiple PW approaches described
        next and may not be deployable on a number of existing hardware
        platforms.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="PID Label ">
        <t>
In this approach, the PID is indicated by including a label after
the PW label that indicates the protocol type, as shown in
<xref target="PEn"></xref>.</t>

        <t>In the PID label approach, a new Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
        Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) element is used to signal the
        mapping between protocol type and the PID label. This approach
        complies with <xref target="RFC3031"></xref>.</t>

        <t>A similar approach to PID label is described in Section 3.4.5 of
        <xref target="RFC5921"></xref>. In this case, when the client is a
        network-layer packet service such as IP or MPLS, a service label and
        demultiplexer label (which may be combined) are used to provide the
        necessary identifications needed to carry this traffic over an
        LSP.</t>

        <t>The authors surveyed the hardware designs produced by a number of
        companies across the industry and concluded that whilst the approach
        complies with the MPLS architecture, it may conflict with a number of
        designers' interpretations of the existing MPLS architecture. This led
        to concerns that the approach may result in unexpected difficulties in
        the future. Specifically, there was an assumption in many designs that a
        forwarding decision should be made on the basis of a single label.
        Whilst the approach is attractive, it cannot be supported by many
        commodity chip sets, and this would require new hardware, which would
        increase the cost of deployment and delay the introduction of a packet
        PW service.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Parallel PWs">
        <t>In this approach, one PW is constructed for each protocol type that
        must be carried between the PEs. Thus, a complete packet PW would
        consist of a bundle of PWs. This model would be very simple
        and efficient from a forwarding point of view. The number of parallel
        PWs required would normally be relatively small. In a typical network,
        there are usually no more that four network-layer protocols that need
        to be supported: IPv4, IPv6, MPLS, and CLNS. However, any solution needs
        to be scalable to a larger number of protocols.</t>

        <t>There are a number of serious downsides with this approach:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>From an operational point of view, the lack of fate sharing
            between the protocol types can lead to complex faults that are
            difficult to diagnose.</t>

            <t>There is an undesirable trade-off in the OAM related to the
            first point. We would have to run an OAM on each PW and
            bind them together, which leads to significant protocol and software
            complexity and does not scale well. Alternatively, we would need to
            run a single OAM session on one of the PWs as a proxy for the
            others and then diagnose any more complex failures on a case-by-case
            basis. To some extent, the issue of fate sharing between protocols
            in the bundle (for example, the assumed fate sharing between CLNS
            and IP in IS-IS) can be mitigated through the use of Bidirectional
Forwarding Detection (BFD).</t>

            <t>The need to configure, manage, and synchronize the behavior of a
            group of PWs as if they were a single PW leads to an increase in
            control-plane complexity.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The Parallel PW mechanism is therefore an approach that simplifies
        the forwarding plane, but only at a cost of a considerable increase in
        other aspects of the design, in particular, operation of the PW.</t>

      <section title="Virtual Ethernet">
        <t>Using a virtual Ethernet to provide a packet PW would require PEs
        to include a virtual (internal) Ethernet interface and then to use an
        Ethernet PW <xref target="RFC4448"></xref> to carry the user traffic.
        This is conceptually simple and can be implemented today without any
        further standards action, although there are a number of applicability
        considerations that it are useful to bring to the attention of the
        community.</t>

        <t>Conceptually, this is a simple approach, and some deployed equipments
        can already do this. However, the requirement to run a complete
        Ethernet adjacency led us to conclude that there was a need to
        identify a simpler approach. The packets encapsulated in an Ethernet
        header have a larger MTU than the other approaches, although this is
        not considered to be an issue on the networks needing to carry packet
        PWs.</t>

        <t>The virtual Ethernet mechanism was the first approach that the
        authors considered, before the merits of the other approaches appeared
        to make them more attractive. As we shall see below, however, the other
        approaches were not without issues, and it appears that the virtual
        Ethernet is the preferred approach to providing a packet PW.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Recommended Encapsulation">
        <t>The operational complexity and the breaking of fate-sharing
        assumptions associated with the parallel PW approach would suggest
        that this is not an approach that should be further pursued.</t>

        <t>The PID label approach gives rise to the concerns that it will
        break implicit behavioral and label-stack size assumptions in many
        implementations. Whilst those assumptions may be addressed with new
        hardware, this would delay the introduction of the technology to the
        point where it is unlikely to gain acceptance in competition with an
        approach that needs no new protocol design and is already supportable
        on many existing hardware platforms.</t>

        <t>The PID in the CW leads to the most compact protocol stack, is
        simple, and requires minimal protocol work. However, it is a new
        forwarding design and, apart from the issue of the larger packet
        header and the simpler adjacency formation, offers no advantage over
        the virtual Ethernet.</t>

        <t>The above considerations bring us back to the virtual Ethernet,
        which is a well-known protocol stack with a well-known (internal)
        client interface. It is already implemented in many hardware platforms
        and is therefore readily deployable. After
        considering a number of initially promising alternatives, the authors
conclude that the
        simplicity and existing hardware make the virtual Ethernet approach to
        the packet PW the most attractive solution.</t>
