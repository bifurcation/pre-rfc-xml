<section title="Introduction">

<t> This document defines a simple enhancement to RFC 2198 <xref
target="RFC2198" /> to support RTP sessions with forward-shifted
redundant encodings, i.e., redundant data sent before the
corresponding primary data. </t>

<t> Forward-shifted redundancy can be used to conceal losses of a
large number of consecutive media frames (e.g., consecutive loss of 
seconds of media). Such capability is highly desirable,
especially in wireless mobile communication environments where the
radio signal to a mobile wireless media receiver can be temporarily
blocked by tall buildings, mountains, tunnels, etc. In other words, the
receiver enters into a shadow of the radio coverage. No new data will
be received when the receiver is in a shadow. </t>

<t> In some extreme cases, the receiver may have to spend seconds or
even tens of seconds in a shadow. 

The traditional backward-shifted
redundant encoding scheme (i.e., redundant data is sent after the
primary data), as currently supported by RFC 2198 <xref
target="RFC2198" />, does not address such consecutive frame losses.
 </t>

<t> In contrast, the forward-shifted redundancy scheme allows one to apply effective anti-shadow loss management at the receiver (as
illustrated in <xref target="ANTI_SHADOW" />), thus preventing
service interruptions when a mobile receiver runs into such a
shadow. </t>

<t> Anti-shadow loss concealment as described in this document can be readily
applied to the streaming of pre-recorded media. Because of the need of
generating the forward-shifted anti-shadow redundant stream, to apply
anti-shadow loss concealment to the streaming of live media will
require the insertion of a delay equal to or greater than the amount
of forward-shifting at the source of media.  </t>

<section title="Sending Redundant Data Inband vs. Out-of-Band">

<t> Regardless of the direction of time shift (e.g., forward-shifting,
or backward-shifting as in RFC 2198) or the encoding scheme (e.g.,
Forward Error Correction (FEC), or non-FEC), there is always the option of sending the redundant
data and the primary data either in the same RTP session (i.e.,
inband) or in separate RTP sessions (i.e., out-of-band). There are
pros and cons for either approach, as outlined below.  </t>

<t> Inband Approach: 
  <list style="hanging">
   <t hangText="o"> Pro: A single RTP session is faster to set up and
   easier to manage. </t>

   <t hangText="o"> Pro: A single RTP session presents a simpler
   problem for NAT/firewall traversal. </t>

   <t hangText="o"> Pro: Less overall overhead -- one source of RTP/UDP/IP
   overhead. </t>

   <t hangText="o"> Con: Lack of flexibility -- difficult for middle
   boxes such as gateways to add/remove the redundant data.  </t>

   <t hangText="o"> Con: Need more specification -- special payload
   formats need to be defined to carry the redundant data inband.
   </t>

  </list>
</t>

<t> Out-of-Band Approach: 
  <list style="hanging">

   <t hangText="o"> Pro: Flexibility -- redundant data can be more
   easily added, removed, or replaced by a middle box such as a
   gateway. </t>

   <t hangText="o"> Pro: Little or no specification -- no new payload
   format is needed. </t>

   <t hangText="o"> Con: Multiple RTP sessions may take longer to
   set up and may be more complex to manage. </t>

   <t hangText="o"> Con: Multiple RTP sessions for NAT/firewall traversal
   are harder to address. </t>

   <t hangText="o"> Con: Bigger overall overhead -- more than one source of
   RTP/UDP/IP overhead. </t>

  </list>
</t>

<t> It is noteworthy that the specification of inband payload formats,
as described in this document and in RFC 2198, does not preclude a deployment from using
the out-of-band approach. Rather, it gives the deployment the choice
to use whichever approach is deemed most beneficial under a given
circumstance.  </t>

<section title="Conventions">

<t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
      this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 
  <xref target="RFC2119" />. </t>

<section title="Allowing Forward-Shifted Redundant Data">

<t> In RFC 2198, the timestamp offset in the additional header
corresponding to a redundant block is defined as a 14-bit unsigned
offset of the timestamp relative to the timestamp given in the RTP header.  As
stated in RFC 2198:  
   <figure>
      <artwork>
   The use of an unsigned offset implies that redundant data must be
   sent after the primary data, and is hence a time to be subtracted
   from the current timestamp to determine the timestamp of the data
   for which this block is the redundancy.
     </artwork>
  </figure>

This effectively prevents RFC 2198 from being used to support
forward-shifted redundant blocks. </t>

<t> In order to support the use of forward-shifted redundant blocks,
the media type "fwdred", which allows a parameter called
"forwardshift", is introduced to indicate the capability of and
willingness to use forward-shifted redundancy and the base value of
timestamp forward-shifting. The base value of "forwardshift" is an
integer equal to or greater than '0' in RTP timestamp units. </t>

<t> In an RTP session that uses forward-shifted redundant encodings,
the timestamp of a redundant block in a received RTP packet is
determined as follows:
   <figure>
      <artwork>
   timestamp of redundant block = timestamp in RTP header
                       - timestamp offset in additional header
                       + forward-shift base value
     </artwork>
  </figure>
</t>

<t> Note that generally, in a forward-shifted session, the timestamp offset 
in the additional header is set to '0'.</t>

<t> The sender MUST NOT change the contents of a packet that appears in 
a forward-shifted stream when it is time to send it in the main stream.

<section title="Mapping Media Type Parameters into SDP">

<t> The information carried in the media type specification has a
specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
<xref target="RFC4566" />, which is commonly used to describe RTP
sessions. When SDP is used to specify sessions employing the
forward-shifted redundant format, the mapping is as
follows: 

  <list style="symbols">
  <t> The media type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name. </t>

  <t> The media subtype ("fwdred") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the encoding
  name. </t> 

  <t> The required parameter "forwardshift" goes in the SDP "a=fmtp"
  attribute by copying it directly from the media type string as
  "forwardshift=value".  </t>

  </list>
</t>

<t>The following is an example of usage that indicates forward-shifted (by 5.1 sec) redundancy:
   <figure>
      <artwork>
   m=audio 12345 RTP/AVP 121 0 5
   a=rtpmap:121 fwdred/8000/1
   a=fmtp:121 0/5 forwardshift=40800
      </artwork>
   </figure>
</t>

<t>The following is an example of usage that indicates sending redundancy without
forward-shifting (equivalent to RFC 2198): 
   <figure>
      <artwork>
   m=audio 12345 RTP/AVP 121 0 5
   a=rtpmap:121 fwdred/8000/1

session. </t>

<section anchor="ANTI_SHADOW" title="Anti-Shadow Loss Concealment Using Forward-Shifted Redundancy">

<t>(This Appendix is included for Informational purposes.)</t>

<t> It is not unusual in a wireless mobile communication environment
that the radio signal to a mobile wireless media receiver can be
temporarily blocked by tall buildings, mountains, tunnels, etc. for a
period of time. In other words, the receiver enters into a shadow of
the radio coverage. When the receiver is in such a shadow, no new data
will be received. In some extreme cases, the receiver may have to spend
seconds or even tens of seconds in such a shadow.  </t>

<t> Without special design considerations to compensate for the loss of
data due to shadowing, a mobile user may experience an unacceptable
level of service interruptions. Traditional redundant encoding
schemes (including RFC 2198 and most FEC schemes) are known to be
ineffective in dealing with such losses of consecutive frames.  </t>

<t> However, the employment of forward-shifted redundancy, in
combination with the anti-shadow loss concealment at the receiver, as
described here, can effectively prevent service interruptions due to
the effect of shadowing. </t>

<section title="Sender-Side Operations">

<t> For anti-shadow loss management, the RTP sender simply adds a
forward-shifted redundant stream (called anti-shadow or AS stream)
while transmitting the primary media stream. The amount of
forward-shifting, which should remain constant for the duration of the
session, will determine the maximal length of shadows that can be
completely concealed at the receiver, as explained below.  </t>

<t> Except for the fact that the redundant stream is
forward-shifted relative to the
primary stream (i.e., the redundant data is sent ahead of the
corresponding primary data), the design decision and trade-offs on the
quality, encoding, bandwidth overhead, etc. of the redundant stream are
not different from the traditional RTP payload redundant scheme. </t>

<t> The following diagram illustrates a segment of the transmission
sequence of a forward-shifted redundant RTP session, in which the AS
stream is forward-shifted by 155 frames. If, for simplicity here, we
assume that the value of the timestamp is incremented by 1 between two
consecutive frames, this forward-shifted redundancy can then be
indicated with:
   <figure>
      <artwork>
   forwardshift=155
     </artwork>
  </figure>
and the setting of the timestamp offset to 0 in all the additional
headers. This can mean 3.1 seconds of forward-shifting if each frame
represents 20 ms of original media.

The anti-shadow receiver operates between two modes -- "normal mode"
and "AS mode".  When the receiver is not in a shadow (i.e., when it still 
receives new data), it operates in the normal mode. Otherwise, it 
operates in the AS mode.
</t>

<section title="Normal-Mode Operation">

<t> In the normal mode, after receiving a new RTP packet that contains
the primary data and forward-shifted AS data, the receiver passes the
primary data directly to the appropriate media decoder for play-out (a
de-jittering buffer may be used before the play-out, but for
simplicity we assume that none is used here), while the received AS data is
stored in an anti-shadow buffer. </t>

<t> Moreover, data stored in the anti-shadow buffer will be
continuously checked to determine whether it has expired. If any
redundant data in the anti-shadow buffer is found to have a timestamp
older (i.e., smaller) than that of the last primary frame passed to
the media decoder, it will be considered expired and be purged from
the anti-shadow buffer.  </t>

<t> The following example illustrates the operation of the anti-shadow
buffer in normal mode. We use the same assumption as in <xref target="fwd-shift-red-xmit" />, and
assume that the initial timestamp value is 103 when the session
starts.

<t> Before the beginning of the session (t&lt;0), the anti-shadow buffer will
be empty. When the first primary frame is received, the play-out will
start immediately, and the first received AS frame is stored in the
anti-shadow buffer. With the arrival of more forward-shifted
redundant frames, the anti-shadow buffer will gradually be filled up.
</t>

<t> For the example shown in <xref target="anti-shadow-buffer" />,
after 3.08 seconds (the amount
of the forward-shifting minus one frame) from the start of the
session, the anti-shadow buffer will be full, holding exactly 3.1
seconds worth of redundant data, with the oldest frame corresponding
to t=3.1&nbsp;sec and the youngest frame corresponding to t=6.18 sec.  </t>

<t> It is not difficult to see that in normal mode, because of the
continuous purge of expired frames and the addition of new frames, the
anti-shadow buffer will always be full, holding the next
'forwardshift' amount of redundant frames.  </t>

<section title="Anti-Shadow-Mode Operation">

<t> When the receiver enters a shadow (or any other conditions that
prevent the receiver from getting new media data), the receiver
switches to the anti-shadow mode, in which it simply continues the
play-out from the forward-shifted redundant data stored in the
anti-shadow buffer. </t>

<t> For the example in <xref target="anti-shadow-buffer" />,
if the receiver enters a shadow at
t=3120, it can continue the play-out by using the forward-shifted
redundant frames (ts=260-414) from the anti-shadow buffer. As long as
the receiver can move out of the shadow by t=6240, there will be no
service interruption.  </t>

<t> When the shadow condition ends (meaning new data starts to arrive
again), the receiver immediately switches back to the normal mode of
operation, playing out from newly arrived primary frames. At the
same time, the arrival of new AS frames will start to re-fill the
anti-shadow buffer.  </t>

<t> However, if the duration of the shadow is longer than the
amount of forward-shifting, the receiver will run out of media
frames from its anti-shadow buffer. At that point, service interruption will
occur. </t>
