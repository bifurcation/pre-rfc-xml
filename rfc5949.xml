    <abstract>
      <t>Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6; RFC 3775) provides a mobile
      node with IP mobility when it performs a handover from one access router
      to another, and fast handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) are specified
      to enhance the handover
      performance in terms of latency and packet loss.  While MIPv6 (and FMIPv6
      as well) requires the participation of the mobile node in the
      mobility-related signaling, Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6; RFC 5213)
      provides IP mobility to nodes that either have
      or do not have MIPv6 functionality without such involvement.
      Nevertheless, the basic performance of PMIPv6 in terms of handover
      latency and packet loss is considered no different from that of
      MIPv6.</t>

      <t>When the fast handover is considered in such an environment, several
      modifications are needed to FMIPv6 to adapt to the network-based
      mobility management.  This document specifies the usage of fast
      handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6; RFC 5568)
      when Proxy Mobile IPv6 is used as the mobility management
      protocol.  Necessary extensions are specified for FMIPv6 to support the
      scenario when the mobile node does not have IP mobility functionality
      and hence is not involved with either MIPv6 or FMIPv6 operations.</t>

      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) <xref target="RFC5213"></xref> provides IP
      mobility to a mobile node that does not support Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) <xref
      target="RFC3775"></xref> mobile node functionality.  A proxy agent in the
      network performs the mobility management signaling on behalf of the
      mobile node.  This model transparently provides mobility for nodes within
      a PMIPv6 domain.  Nevertheless, the basic performance of PMIPv6 in terms

      <t>Fast handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) <xref

      latency for Mobile IPv6 by allowing a mobile node to send packets as

      mobile node as soon as its attachment is detected by the new access
      router.  This document extends FMIPv6 for Proxy MIPv6 operation to
      minimize handover delay and packet loss as well as to transfer

    <section anchor="overview" title="Proxy-Based FMIPv6 Protocol Overview">
      <t>This specification describes fast handover protocols for the
      network-based mobility management protocol called Proxy Mobile IPv6
      (PMIPv6) [RFC5213].  The core functional entities defined in PMIPv6 are
      the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) and the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG).  The
      LMA is the topological anchor point for the mobile node's home network
      prefix(es).  The MAG acts as an access router (AR) for the mobile node
      and performs the mobility management procedures on its behalf.  The MAG
      is responsible for detecting the mobile node's movements to and from the
      access link and for initiating binding registrations to the mobile
      node's local mobility anchor.  If the MAGs can be informed of the
      detachment and/or attachment of the mobile node in a timely manner via,
      e.g., lower-layer signaling, it will become possible to optimize the
      handover procedure, which involves establishing a connection on the new
      link and signaling between mobility agents, compared to the baseline
      specification of PMIPv6.</t>

      <t>In order to further improve the performance during the handover, this
      document specifies a bidirectional tunnel between the Previous MAG
      (PMAG) and the New MAG (NMAG) to tunnel packets meant for the mobile
      node.  In order to enable the NMAG to send the Proxy Binding Update
      (PBU), the Handover Initiate (HI) and Handover Acknowledge (HAck)
      messages in <xref target="RFC5568"></xref> are extended for context
      transfer, in which parameters such as the mobile node's Network Access
      Identifier (NAI), Home Network Prefix (HNP), and IPv4 Home Address are
      transferred from the PMAG.  New flags, 'P' and 'F', are defined for the
      HI and HAck messages to distinguish from those in <xref
      target="RFC5568"></xref> and to request packet forwarding,
      respectively.</t>

      <t>In this document, the Previous Access Router (PAR) and New Access
      Router (NAR) are interchangeable with the PMAG and NMAG, respectively.
      The reference network is illustrated in <xref
      target="ref_network"></xref>.  The access networks in the figure (i.e.,
      P-AN and N-AN) are composed of Access Points (APs) defined in <xref
      target="RFC5568"></xref>, which are often referred to as base stations
      in cellular networks.</t>

      <t>Since a mobile node is not directly involved with IP mobility
      protocol operations, it follows that the mobile node is not directly
      involved with fast handover procedures either.  Hence, the messages
      involving the mobile node in <xref target="RFC5568"></xref> are not used
      when PMIPv6 is in use.  More specifically, the Router Solicitation for
      Proxy Advertisement (RtSolPr), the Proxy Router Advertisement (PrRtAdv),
      Fast Binding Update (FBU), Fast Binding Acknowledgment (FBack), and the
      Unsolicited Neighbor Advertisement (UNA) messages are not applicable in
      the PMIPv6 context.  A MAG that receives a RtSolPr or FBU message from a
      mobile node SHOULD behave as if they do not implement FMIPv6 as defined
      in <xref target="RFC5568"></xref> at all -- continuing to operate
      according to this specification within the network -- or alternatively,
      start serving that particular mobile node as specified in <xref
      target="RFC5568"></xref>.</t>

      <section anchor="operation" title="Protocol Operation">
        <t>There are two modes of operation in <xref target="RFC5568">FMIPv6
        </xref>.  In the predictive mode of fast handover, a bidirectional
        tunnel between the PMAG (PAR) and NMAG (NAR) is established prior to
        the mobile node's attachment to the NMAG.  In the reactive mode, this
        tunnel establishment takes place after the mobile node attaches to the
        NMAG.  In order to alleviate the packet loss during a mobile node's
        handover (especially when the mobile node is detached from both
        links), the downlink packets for the mobile node need to be
        buffered
        either at the PMAG or NMAG, depending on when the packet forwarding is
        performed.  It is hence REQUIRED that all MAGs have the capability and
        enough resources to buffer packets for the mobile nodes accommodated
        by them.  The buffer size to be prepared and the rate at which buffered
        packets are drained are addressed in Section 5.4 of <xref
        target="RFC5568"></xref>.  Note that the protocol operation specified
        in the document is transparent to the local mobility anchor (LMA);
        hence there is no new functional requirement or change on the LMA.</t>

        <t>Unlike MIPv6, the mobile node in the PMIPv6 domain is not involved
        with IP mobility signaling; therefore, in order for the predictive
        fast handover to work effectively, it is REQUIRED that the mobile node
        is capable of reporting lower-layer information to the AN at a short
        enough interval, and that the AN is capable of sending the Handover
        indication to the PMAG at an appropriate timing.  The sequence of
        events for the predictive fast handover is illustrated in <xref
        target="FMIP_pre"></xref>.

          </list></t>

        <t>According to Section 4 of <xref target="RFC5568"></xref>, the
        previous MAG establishes a binding between the Previous Care-of
        Address (PCoA) and New Care-of Address (NCoA) to forward packets for
        the mobile node to the new MAG, and the new MAG creates a proxy
        neighbor cache entry to receive those packets for the NCoA before the
        mobile node arrives.  In the case of PMIPv6, however, the only address
        that is used by the mobile node is the Mobile Node's Home
        Address (MN-HoA), so the PMAG forwards the mobile node's packets to the
        NMAG
        instead of the NCoA.  The NMAG then simply decapsulates those packets
        and delivers them to the mobile node.  FMIPv4 <xref
        target="RFC4988"></xref> specifies forwarding when the mobile node
        uses the home address as its on-link address rather than the care-of
        address.  The usage in PMIPv6 is similar to that in FMIPv4, where the
        address(es) used by the mobile node is/are based on its HNP(s).  Since
        the NMAG can obtain the link-layer address (MN LL-ID) and HNP(s) via
        the HI message (also the interface identifier of the mobile node's
        link-local address (MN LLA-ID), if available), it can create a neighbor
        cache entry for the link-local address and the routes for the whole
        HNP(s), even before the mobile node performs Neighbor Discovery.  For
        the uplink packets from the mobile node after handover in step (j), the
        NMAG forwards the packets to the PMAG through the tunnel established
        in step (f).  The PMAG then decapsulates and sends them to the local
        mobility anchor.</t>

        <t>The timing of the context transfer and that of packet forwarding
        may be different.  Thus, a new flag 'F' and Option Code values for it
        in the HI and HAck messages are defined to request forwarding.  To
        request buffering, the 'U' flag has already been defined in <xref
        target="RFC5568"></xref>.  If the PMAG receives the HI message with the
        'F' flag set, it starts forwarding packets for the mobile node.  The HI
        message with the 'U' flag set MAY be sent earlier if the timing of
        buffering is different from that of forwarding.  If packet forwarding
        is completed, the PMAG MAY send the HI message with the 'F' flag set
        and
        the Option Code value set to 2.  Via this message, the ARs on both ends
        can tear down the forwarding tunnel synchronously.</t>

        <t>In the case of the reactive handover for PMIPv6, since the mobile
        node does not send either the FBU or UNA, it would be more natural
        that the NMAG send the HI message to the PMAG after the mobile node
        has moved
        to the new link.  The NMAG then needs to obtain the information of the
        PMAG beforehand.  Such information could be provided, for example, by
        the mobile node sending the AP-ID on the old link and/or by the
        lower-layer procedures between the P-AN and N-AN.  The exact method is
        not specified in this document.  <xref target="FMIP_react"></xref>
        illustrates the reactive fast handover procedures for PMIPv6, where

            hangIndent="3" style="numbers">

            <t>As the default behavior, the inter-MAG tunnel uses the same
            encapsulation mechanism as that for the PMIPv6 tunnel between the
            local mobility anchor and the MAGs.  The PMAG and NMAG
            automatically start using the same encapsulation mechanism without

        <t>The necessary information MUST be transferred in the HI/HAck
           messages to determine whether a mobile node's packets should
           be forwarded immediately or at a later time.

Such information includes the HNP(s) (or
        IPv4-MN-HoA) and/or GRE key(s).  In the case of GRE tunneling with GRE
        keys being used, for each mobility session, the NMAG selects the GRE
        key for the downlink packets, and the PMAG selects the GRE key for the
        uplink packets.  These GRE keys are exchanged between the PMAG and the
        NMAG using the GRE Key option as described in <xref
        target="RFC5845"></xref>; e.g., in the case of the reactive mode as
        shown in Figure 3, the DL GRE key is communicated in the HI message
        while the UL GRE key is sent in the HAck message.  In the case of
        downlink packets, the PMAG redirects the mobile node's packets from the
        local
        mobility anchor towards the NMAG, and if the mobile node is ready to
        receive those packets or the N-AN can handle them regardless of the
        state of the mobile node, the NMAG SHOULD immediately send them
        towards the N-AN; otherwise, it SHOULD buffer them until the mobile
        node is ready.  In the case of uplink packets, the NMAG SHOULD
        reverse-tunnel
        them from the mobile node towards the PMAG, and the PMAG will then
        send them to the local mobility anchor.</t>

        <t>When the PMAG or NMAG receives the HI message with the 'U' flag set,
        it prepares to buffer the mobile node's packets and returns the HAck
        message with the same sequence number.  It MUST be followed by another
        HI message with the 'F' flag set at an appropriate time to forward the
        buffered packets.</t>

        <t>If the MAG that received the HI message encounters an erroneous
        situation (e.g., insufficient buffer space), it SHOULD immediately
        send the HAck message with the cause of the error and cancel all
        tunneling operations.</t>

      <section anchor="IPv4support" title="IPv4 Support Considerations">
        <t>The motivation and usage scenarios of IPv4 protocol support by
        PMIPv6 are described in <xref target="RFC5844"></xref>.  The scope
        of IPv4 support covers the following two features: <list
            hangIndent="3" style="symbols">
            <t>IPv4 Home Address Mobility Support, and</t>

            <t>IPv4 Transport Support.</t>
          </list>As for IPv4 Home Address Mobility Support, the mobile node
        acquires the IPv4 Home Address (IPv4-MN-HoA), and in the case of
        handover,
        the PMAG needs to transfer IPv4-MN-HoA to the NMAG, which is the inner
        destination address of the packets forwarded on the downlink.  For this
        purpose, the IPv4 Address option described in <xref
        target="mo_ipv4address"></xref> is used.  In order to provide IPv4
        Transport Support, the NMAG needs to know the IPv4 address of the
        local mobility anchor (IPv4-LMAA) to send PMIPv6 signaling messages to
        the local mobility anchor in the IPv4 transport network.  For this
        purpose, a new option called the LMA Address (LMAA) option is defined
        in <xref target="mo_lmaao"></xref> so as to convey IPv4-LMAA from the
        PMAG to the NMAG.</t>

    <section anchor="sec:misc" title="PMIPv6-Related Fast Handover Issues">
      <section title="Manageability Considerations">
        <t>This specification does not require any additional IP-level
        functionality on the local mobility anchor and the mobile node running
        in the PMIPv6 domain.  A typical network interface that the mobile node
        could be assumed to have is one with the cellular network, where the
        network controls the movement of the mobile node.  Different types of
        interfaces could be involved, such as different generations (3G and
        3.9G) or different radio access systems.  This specification supports a
        mobile node with the single radio mode, where only one interface is
        active at any given time.  The assigned IP address is preserved whether
        the physical interface changes or not, and the mobile node can identify
        which interface should be used if there are multiple ones.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Expedited Packet Transmission">
        <t>The protocol specified in this document enables the NMAG to obtain
        parameters that would otherwise be available only by communicating
        with the local mobility anchor.  For instance, the HNP(s) and/or
        IPv4-MN-HoA of a mobile node are made available to the NMAG through
        context transfer.  This allows the NMAG to perform some procedures that
        may be beneficial.  The NMAG, for example, SHOULD send a Router
        Advertisement (RA) with prefix information to the mobile node as soon
        as its link attachment is detected (e.g., via receipt of a Router
        Solicitation message).  Such an RA is recommended, for example, in
        scenarios where the mobile node uses a new radio interface while
        attaching to the NMAG; since the mobile node does not have information
        regarding the new interface, it will not be able to immediately send
        packets without first receiving an RA with HNP(s).  Especially in the
        reactive fast handover, the NMAG gets to know the HNP(s) assigned to
        the mobile node on the previous link at step (d) in <xref
        target="FMIP_react"></xref>.  In order to reduce the communication
        disruption time, the NMAG SHOULD expect the mobile node to keep using
        the same HNP and to send uplink packets before that step upon the
        mobile node's request.  However, if the HAck message from the PMAG
        returns a
        different HNP or the subsequent PMIPv6 binding registration for the
        HNP fails for some reason, then the NMAG MUST withdraw the advertised
        HNP by sending another RA with zero prefix lifetime for the HNP in
        question.  This operation is the same as that described in Section
        6.12 of <xref target="RFC5213"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The protocol specified in this document is applicable regardless of
        whether link-layer addresses are used between a mobile node and its
        MAG.  A mobile node should be able to continue sending packets on the
        uplink even when it changes link.  When link-layer addresses are used,
        the mobile node performs Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD) <xref
        target="RFC4861"></xref>, after attaching to a new link, probing the
        reachability of its default router.  The new router should respond to
        the NUD probe, providing its link-layer address in the solicited
        Neighbor Advertisement, which is common in the PMIPv6 domain.
        Implementations should allow the mobile node to continue to send
        uplink packets while it is performing NUD.</t>

          <t>In the case where there are only Req-type-n and Req-length-n
          fields, the value of Req-length-n is set to zero.  If additional
          information besides Req-type-n is necessary to uniquely specify
          the requested context, such information follows after
          Req-length-n.  For example, when the requested contexts start with
          the HNP option (type=22), the MN Link-layer ID option (type=25), and
          the Vendor-Specific option (type=19), the required option format
          looks as follows:

</artwork>
            </figure>

The first two options can uniquely identify the requested
          contexts (i.e., the HNP and MN Link-layer ID) by the Req-type, so
          the Req&nbhy;length is set to zero; however, the subsequent
          Vendor-Specific option further needs the Vendor-ID and Sub-Type to
          identify the requested context, so these parameters follow, and the
          Req-length is set to 5.  Note that the exact values in the Vendor-ID
          and Sub-Type follow <xref target="RFC5094"></xref>.</t>

    <section title="Applicable Use Cases">
      <section title="PMIPv6 Handoff Indication">
        <t>PMIPv6 <xref target="RFC5213"></xref> defines the Handoff Indicator
        option and also describes the type of handoff and values that can
        be set for this option.  This document proposes one approach to
        determining the
        handoff type by the NMAG when the handoff of the mobile node is
        executed.</t>

        <t>According to <xref target="RFC5213"></xref>, the following handoff
        types are defined: <list>
            <t>0) Reserved</t>

            <t>1) Attachment over a new interface</t>

            <t>2) Handoff between two different interfaces of the mobile
            node</t>

            <t>3) Handoff between mobile access gateways for the same
            interface</t>

            <t>4) Handoff state unknown</t>

            <t>5) Handoff state not changed (Re-registration)</t>
          </list>

        Assuming that there is a valid MN Link-layer Identifier (MN
        LL-ID), the following solution can be considered.  When the NMAG
        receives the MN LL-ID from the PMAG in the MN LL-ID option via the HI
        or HAck message, the NMAG compares it with the new MN LL-ID that is
        obtained from the mobile node in the N-AN.  If these two MN LL-IDs are
        the same, the handoff type falls into type 3 (defined above)
        and the Handoff Indicator value is set to 3.  If these two
        MN LL-IDs are different, the handoff is likely to be type 2
        (defined above) since the HI/HAck message exchange implies that
        this is a handoff rather than a multihoming, and therefore the
        Handoff Indicator value can be set to 2.

        If there is no HI/HAck exchange performed prior
        to the network attachment of the mobile node in the N-AN, the NMAG may
        infer that this is a multi-homing case and set the Handoff Indicator
        value to 1.  In the case of re-registration, the MAG, to which the
        mobile node is attached, can determine if the handoff state is not
        changed, so the MAG can set the HI value to 5 without any additional
        information.  If no handoff type can be assumed or if there is no
        valid MN LL-ID available, the NMAG may set the value to&nbsp;4.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Local Routing">
        <t>As described in Section 6.10.3 of <xref target="RFC5213"></xref>, if
        the EnableMAGLocalRouting flag is set, when two mobile nodes are
        attached
        to one MAG, the traffic between them may be locally routed.  If one
        mobile node moves from this MAG (PMAG) to another MAG (NMAG) and if
        the PMAG does not detect the mobile node's detachment, it will
        continue to forward packets locally forever.  This situation is more
        likely to happen in the reactive fast handover with Wireless Local
        Area Network (WLAN) access, which
        does not have the capability to detect the detachment of the mobile
        node in a timely manner.  This specification can be applied to handle
        this case.  When the mobile node attaches to the NMAG, the NMAG sends
        the HI message to the PMAG with the 'F' flag set, which makes the PMAG
        realize the detachment of the mobile node and establish the inter-MAG
        tunnel.  The PMAG immediately stops the local routing and sends the
        packets for the mobile node to the NMAG via that tunnel; the packets
        are then delivered to the mobile node on the new link.</t>
