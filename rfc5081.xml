	This memo proposes extensions to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to support
	the OpenPGP key format.  The extensions discussed here
	include a certificate type negotiation mechanism, and the required
	modifications to the TLS Handshake Protocol.

      <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
        <t>
The IETF has two sets of standards for public key certificates,
one set for use of X.509 certificates <xref target="PKIX"/> and one for
OpenPGP certificates <xref target="OpenPGP"/>. At the time of writing,
TLS <xref target="TLS"/> 
standards are defined to use only X.509 certificates. 
This document specifies a way to negotiate use of OpenPGP certificates for a TLS 
session, and specifies how to transport OpenPGP certificates via TLS. The 
proposed extensions are backward compatible with the current TLS 
specification, so that existing client and server implementations 
that make use of X.509 certificates are not affected.
         </t>
     </section>
         <section anchor="terms" title="Terminology">

         <t>
             The term "OpenPGP key" is used in this document as in the OpenPGP specification 
             <xref target="OpenPGP"/>. We use the term "OpenPGP certificate" to refer to
             OpenPGP keys that are enabled for authentication. 
         </t>
         <t>
           This document uses the same notation and terminology used in the TLS Protocol specification
           <xref target="TLS"/>.

         The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
         NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
         "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
         <xref target="RFC2119"/>.

            <t>
	This section describes the changes to the TLS handshake message
	contents when OpenPGP certificates are to be used for authentication.

	      <section anchor="clihello" title="Client Hello">
               <t>
		   In order to indicate the support of multiple certificate types, clients MUST include an
                   extension of type "cert_type" (see <xref target="IANA"/>) to the extended client hello
                   message. The hello extension mechanism is described in <xref target="TLSEXT"/>.
              </t>

              <t>
		   This extension carries a list of supported certificate types the client can use, sorted
                   by client preference. This extension MUST be omitted if the client only supports X.509
                   certificates. The "extension_data" field of this extension contains a
                   CertificateTypeExtension structure.

                No new cipher suites are required to use OpenPGP certificates. 
                All existing cipher suites that support a compatible, with the key, key exchange method can be used in combination with OpenPGP certificates.

                <t>
If the server receives a client hello that contains the "cert_type" extension and
chooses a cipher suite that requires a certificate, then two outcomes are possible.  
The server MUST either select a certificate type from the certificate_types
field in the extended client hello or terminate the connection with a fatal alert of type
"unsupported_certificate".
		</t>
		<t>
		   The certificate type selected by the server is encoded in a CertificateTypeExtension structure, 
		   which is included in the extended server hello message using an extension of type "cert_type". 
		   Servers that only support X.509 certificates MAY omit including the "cert_type" extension in the extended server hello.

		   The contents of the certificate message sent from server to client and vice versa are

		   If the OpenPGP certificate type is negotiated, then it is required to present an OpenPGP certificate in 
		   the certificate message. The certificate must contain a public key that matches the selected key exchange algorithm, as shown below.

      <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
          <t>
              All security considerations discussed in <xref target="TLS"/>, 
              <xref target="TLSEXT"/>, and <xref target="OpenPGP"/> apply to this document.
              Considerations about the use of the web of trust or identity
              and certificate verification
              procedure are outside the scope of this document. These are considered
              issues to be handled by the application layer protocols.
          </t>
          <t>
              The protocol for certificate type negotiation is
              identical in operation to ciphersuite negotiation of the <xref target="TLS"/> 
              specification with the addition of default values when the extension is 
              omitted. Since those omissions have a unique meaning and the same 
              protection is applied to the values as with ciphersuites, it is 
              believed that the security properties of this negotiation are the same 
              as with ciphersuite negotiation.
          </t>
          <t>
              When using OpenPGP fingerprints instead of the full certificates,
              the discussion in Section 6.3 of <xref target="TLSEXT"/> for 
              "Client Certificate URLs" applies, especially when external servers are
              used to retrieve keys. However, a major difference is that although the "client_certificate_url"
              extension
              allows identifing certificates without including the certificate hashes, this
              is not possible in the protocol proposed here. 
              In this protocol, the certificates, when not sent, are always identified by their fingerprint, which 
              serves as a cryptographic hash of the certificate (see Section 12.2 of <xref target="OpenPGP"/>).
          </t>
          <t>
              The information that is available to participating parties and 
              eavesdroppers (when confidentiality is not available through a previous 
              handshake) is the number and the 
              types of certificates they hold, plus the contents of certificates.
          </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
          <t>
              This document defines a new TLS extension, "cert_type", assigned
              a value of 9 from the TLS
              ExtensionType registry defined in <xref target="TLSEXT"/>.
              This value is used as the extension number for the extensions in both the client 
              hello message and the server hello message. The new extension type is
              used for certificate type negotiation.
          </t>

              <t>
                  The "cert_type" extension contains an 8-bit CertificateType field, for which
                  a new registry, named "TLS Certificate Types", is established in this document, to be maintained by IANA.
                  The registry is segmented in the following way:
                  <list style="numbers">
                      <t>Values 0 (X.509) and 1 (OpenPGP) are defined in this document.</t>
                      <t>Values from 2 through 223 decimal inclusive are assigned
                          via IETF Consensus <xref target="RFC2434"/>.</t>
                      <t>Values from 224 decimal through 255 decimal
                          inclusive are reserved for Private Use <xref target="RFC2434"/>.
