      <t>This RFC archives the report of the IETF - ITU-T Joint Working
      Team (JWT) on the application of MPLS to transport networks. The
      JWT recommended of Option 1: The IETF and the ITU-T jointly
      agree to work together and bring transport requirements into the
      IETF and extend IETF MPLS forwarding, OAM (Operations,
      Administration, and Management), survivability, network
      management and control plane protocols to meet those
      requirements through the IETF Standards Process. This RFC is
      available in ASCII (which contains a summary of the slides) and
      in PDF (which contains the summary and a copy of the slides).

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>For a number of years, the ITU-T has been designing a
      connection-oriented packet switched technology to be used in
      Transport Networks. A Transport Network can be considered to be
      the network that provides wide area connectivity upon which
      other services, such as IP or the phone network, run. The ITU-T
      chose to adapt the IETF&rsquo;s MPLS to this task, and
      introduced a protocol suite known as T-MPLS.</t>

      <t>Quite late in the ITU-T design and specification cycle, there were a
      number of liaison exchanges between the ITU-T and the IETF concerning
      this technology.  These liaisons can be found on the IETF Liaison Statement web page <xref target="LIAISON"></xref>.  In addition, the chairs of the
      MPLS, PWE3, BFD, and CCAMP working groups as well as the Routing and
      Internet Area Directors attended a number of ITU-T meetings. During this
      process, the IETF became increasingly concerned that the incompatibility
      of IETF MPLS and ITU-T T-MPLS would "represent a mutual danger to
      both the Internet and the Transport network". These concerns led the
      chairs of the IESG and IAB to take the step of sending a liaison to the
      ITU-T, stating that either T-MPLS should become fully compliant MPLS
      protocol, standardized under the IETF process (the so-called
      &ldquo;Option 1&rdquo;), or it should become a completely disjoint
      protocol with a new name and completely new set of code points (the so-called &ldquo;Option 2&rdquo;)<xref target="Ethertypes"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Option 1 and Option 2 were discussed at an ITU-T meeting of Question
      12 Study Group 15 in Stuttgart <xref target="Stuttgart"></xref>, where
      it was proposed that a Joint (ITU-T &ndash; IETF) Team should be formed
      to evaluate the issues, and make a recommendation to ITU-T management on
      the best way forward.</t>

      <t>Following discussion between the management of the IETF and the ITU-T,
      a Joint Working Team (JWT) was established; this was supported by an
      IETF Design Team and an Ad Hoc Group on T-MPLS in the ITU-T <xref
      target="ahtmpls"></xref>. The first meeting of the Ad Hoc group occurred
      during the ITU-T Geneva Plenary in February 2008. As a result of
      the work of the JWT and the resulting agreement on a way forward, the
      fears that a set of next-generation network transport specifications
      developed by ITU-T could cause interoperability problems were
      allayed.</t>

      <t>The JWT submitted their report to the ITU-T and IETF management in the
      form of a set of Power Point slides <xref target="MPLS-TP-22"></xref>.
      (See the PDF of this RFC.)  The ITU-T have accepted
      the JWT recommendations, as documented in <xref
      target="MPLS-TP"></xref>. This RFC archives the JWT report in a format
      that is accessible to the IETF.</t>

      <t>This RFC is available in ASCII (which contains a
      summary of the slides) and in PDF (which contains the summary
      and a copy of the slides). In the case of a conflict
      between the summary and the slides, the slides take
      precedence. Since those slides were the basis of an important
      agreement between the IETF and the ITU-T, it should further be
      noted that in the event that the PDF version of the slides
      differs from those emailed to ITU-T and IETF management on 18
      April 2008 by the co-chairs of the JWT, the emailed slides take
      precedence.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Executive Summary">
      <t>Slides 4 to 10 provide an executive summary of the JWT Report. The
      following is a summary of those slides:</t>

      <t>The JWT achieved consensus on the recommendation of Option 1: to
      jointly agree to work together and bring transport requirements into the
      IETF and extend IETF MPLS forwarding, OAM, survivability, network
      management, and control plane protocols to meet those requirements
      through the IETF Standards Process. The Joint Working Team believed that
      this would fulfill the mutual goals of improving the functionality of the
      transport networks and the Internet and guaranteeing complete
      interoperability and architectural soundness. This technology would be
      referred to as the Transport Profile for MPLS (MPLS-TP).</t>

      <t>The JWT recommended that future work should focus on:</t>

      <t>In the IETF: <list>
          <t>Definition of the MPLS &ldquo;Transport Profile&rdquo;
          (MPLS-TP).</t>
        </list> In the ITU-T: <list>
          <t>Integration of MPLS-TP into the transport network,</t>

          <t>Alignment of the current T-MPLS ITU-T Recommendations with
          MPLS-TP and,</t>

          <t>Termination of the work on current T-MPLS.</t>
        </list>The technical feasibility analysis concluded there were no
      &ldquo;show stopper&rdquo; issues in the recommendation of Option 1 and
      that the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire architecture could be extended to
      support transport functional requirements. Therefore, the team believed
      that there was no need for the analysis of any other option.</t>

      <t>The JWT proposed that the MPLS Interoperability Design Team (MEAD
      Team), JWT, and Ad Hoc T-MPLS groups continue as described in SG15
      TD515/PLEN <xref target="JWTcreation"></xref> with the following
      roles:<list>
          <t>Facilitate the rapid exchange of information between the IETF and
          ITU-T,</t>

          <t>Ensure that the work is progressing with a consistent set of
          priorities,</t>

          <t>Identify gaps/inconsistencies in the solutions under
          development,</t>

          <t>Propose solutions for consideration by the appropriate
          WG/Question,</t>

          <t>Provide guidance when work on a topic is stalled or a technical
          decision must be mediated.</t>
        </list>None of these groups would have the authority to create or
      modify IETF RFCs or ITU-T Recommendations. Any such work would be
      progressed via the normal process of the respective standards body.
      Direct participation in the work by experts from the IETF and ITU-T
      would be required.</t>

      <t>The JWT recommended that the normative definition of the MPLS-TP that
      supports the ITU-T transport network requirements be captured in
      IETF RFCs. It proposed that the ITU-T should:<list>
          <t>Develop ITU-T Recommendations to allow MPLS-TP to be integrated
          with current transport equipment and networks, including in agreement
          with the IETF, the definition of any ITU-T-specific functionality
          within the MPLS-TP architecture via the MPLS change process
          <xref target="RFC4929"/>,
</t>

          <t>Revise existing ITU-T Recommendations to align with MPLS-TP,</t>

          <t>ITU-T Recommendations will make normative references to the
          appropriate RFCs.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The executive summary contains a number of detailed JWT
      recommendations to both IETF and ITU-T management together with proposed
      document structure and timetable.</t>

      <t>These JWT recommendations were accepted by ITU-T management <xref target="MPLS-TP1"/>.

</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Introduction and Background Material">
      <t>Slides 11 to 22 provide introductory and background material.</t>

      <t>The starting point of the analysis was to attempt to satisfy Option 1
      by showing the high-level architecture, any show stoppers, and the design
      points that would need to be addressed after the decision had been made
      to work together. Option 1 was stated as preferred by the IETF and
      because Option 1 was shown to be feasible, Option 2 was not
      explored.</t>

      <t>The work was segmented into five groups looking at: Forwarding, OAM,
      Protection, Control Plane, and Network Management. The outcome of each
      review was reported in the following sections and is summarized below.</t>

      <t>There follows a detailed description of the overall requirements and
      architectural assumptions that would be used in the remainder of the
      work.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="High-Level Architecture ">
      <t>Slides 23 to 28 provide a high-level architectural view of the
      proposed design.</t>

      <t>The spectrum of services that the MPLS-TP needs to address and the wider
      MPLS context is described, together with the provisioning issues. Some
      basic terminology needed in order to understand the MPLS-TP is defined and some
      context examples are provided.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="OAM and Forwarding">
      <t>Slides 29 to 32 describe the OAM requirements and talk about segment
      recovery and node identification.</t>

      <t>Slides 33 to 38 introduce OAM hierarchy and describe Label
      Switched Path (LSP) monitoring, the Maintenance End Point (MEP)
      and Maintenance Intermediate Point (MIP) relationship and the
      LSP and pseudowire (PW) monitoring relationship.</t>

      <t>Sides 39 to 46 introduce the Associated Channel Header (ACH) and its
      generalization to carry the OAM over LSPs through the use of the "Label
      for You" (LFU).</t>

      <t>Slides 47 to 48 provide a description of how the forwarding and the
      ACH OAM mechanism work in detail. A significant number of scenarios are
      described to work through the operation on a case-by-case basis. These
      slides introduce a new textual notation to simplify the description of
      complex MPLS stacks.</t>

      <t>Note that the MPLS forwarding, as specified by IETF RFCs, requires no
      changes to support MPLS-TP.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Control Plane">
      <t>Sides 79 to 83 discuss various aspects of the control plane
      design.</t>

      <t>Control plane sub-team stated that existing IETF protocols can be
      used to provide required functions for transport network operation and
      for data-communications-network/switched-circuit-network operation. IETF
      GMPLS protocols have already applied to Automatic Switched Optical Network (ASON) architecture, and the JWT
      considered that any protocol extensions needed will be easy to make. The
      slides provide a number of scenarios to demonstrate this conclusion.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Survivability">
      <t>The survivability considerations are provided in slides 95 to 104.</t>

      <t>The survivability sub-team did not find any issues that prevented the
      creation of an MPLS-TP, and therefore recommended that Option 1 be
      selected. Three potential solutions were identified. Each solution has
      different attributes and advantages, and it was thought that further work in
      the design phase should eliminate one or more of these options and/or
      provide an applicability statement.</t>

      <t>After some clarifications and discussion, there follow in the slide
      set a number of linear and ring protection scenarios with examples of
      how they might be addressed.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Network Management">
      <t>Slide 106 states the conclusion of the Network Management sub-team :
      that it found no issues that prevent the creation of an MPLS-TP and
      hence Option 1 can be selected.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Summary">
      <t>Slide 113 provides a summary of the JWT report.</t>

      <t>The JWT found no show stoppers and unanimously agreed that they had
      identified a viable solution. They therefore recommend Option 1. They
      stated that in their view, it is technically feasible that the existing
      MPLS architecture can be extended to meet the requirements of a
      Transport profile, and that the architecture allows for a single OAM
      technology for LSPs, PWs, and a deeply nested network. From probing
      various ITU-T Study Groups and IETF Working Groups it appears that MPLS
      reserved label 14 has had wide enough implementation and deployment that
      the solution may have to use a different reserved label (e.g., Label 13).
      The JWT recommended that extensions to Label 14 should cease.</t>

      <t>The JWT further recommended that this architecture appeared to
      subsume Y.1711, since the requirements can be met by the mechanism
      proposed in their report.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations ">
      <t>There are no IANA considerations that arise from this document.</t>

      <t>Any IANA allocations needed to implement the JWT recommendation will
      be requested in the Standards-Track RFCs that define the MPLS-TP
      protocol.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The only security consideration that arises as a result of this
      document is the need to ensure that this is a faithful representation of
      the JWT report.</t>

      <t>The protocol work that arises from this agreement will have technical
      security requirements that will be identified in the RFCs that define
      MPLS-TP.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="The JWT Report">
      <t>In the PDF of this RFC, there follows the JWT report as a set
      of slides.</t>
