			<t>
			 This document describes how to send alarm
			 information in syslog. It includes the
			 mapping of ITU perceived severities onto
			 syslog message fields. It also includes a
			 number of alarm-specific SD-PARAM definitions
			 from X.733 and the IETF Alarm MIB.

<section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>
In addition to sending out alarm information asynchronously via
protocols such as the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) or the
Network Configuration Protocol (Netconf), many 
implementations also log alarms via syslog. This memo defines a set of SD-PARAMs to support logging and defines a mapping of syslog severity to the severity of the alarm.
</t>
<t>
The Alarm MIB <xref target="RFC3877"/> includes mandatory alarm fields
from X.733 <xref target="X.733" /> as
well as information from X.736 <xref target="X.736" />. In additional, the Alarm MIB
introduces its own alarm fields. This memo reuses terminology and
fields from the Alarm MIB. 
</t>     
      <t>
            The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
            "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
            document are to be interpreted as described in
            <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
       Alarm-related terminology is defined in <xref target="RFC3877"/>.     
      </t>
  <t>SD-ID, SD-PARAM, and other syslog-related terms are defined in [RFC5424].</t>
</section>      
<section title="Severity Mapping">      
<t>
	The Alarm MIB <xref target="RFC3877"/> defines ITU perceived
	severities; it is useful to
	be able to relate these to the syslog message fields, particularly in the case where
	alarms are being logged.
	This memo describes the representation of ITU perceived severities in appropriate
	syslog fields, which are described in  <xref target="RFC5424"/>.
	Syslog offers both a so-called SEVERITY as well as STRUCTURED-DATA. Due to
	constraints in syslog, there is no one-to-one mapping possible for SEVERITY.
	A STRUCTURED-DATA element is defined in this document to allow inclusion of the 
	unmodified ITU perceived severity.
</t>
	<t>
		Syslog supports Severity values different from ITU
		perceived severities.

<!--[rfced] We note that RFC 5424 uses "SEVERITY value" or "Severity
value." Please let us know if "severity" in such instances in this 
document need to be made consistent in capitalization and, if so,
which form mis preferred.-->

		These are defined in Section 6.2.1 of 
		<xref target="RFC5424"/>.
		The mapping shown in Table 1 below SHOULD be used to map ITU perceived severities
		to syslog severities.

<section title="Alarm STRUCTURED-DATA Elements">
	<t>
		STRUCTURED-DATA allows the inclusion of any structured
		information into a syslog message. The following are
		defined in this document to support the structuring of alarm information.
	      <list style="symbols">
	            <t>Resource Under Alarm</t>
	            <t>Probable Cause</t>
	            <t>Event Type</t>
	            <t>Perceived Severity</t>
	            <t>Trend Indication</t>
	            <t>Resource URI</t>
	      </list>
	</t>
<t>Support of the "alarm" SD-ID is optional but, once supported, some of the SD-PARAMS are mandatory.</t>
      
<section title="resource">
   <t>If the "alarm" SD-ID is included, the "resource" SD-PARAM MUST be included. This item uniquely
   identifies the resource under alarm within the scope of a network element. </t>
</section>  
<section title="probableCause">
      <t>If the "alarm" SD-ID is included, the "probableCause" SD-PARAM MUST be included. This parameter
            is the mnemonic associated with the IANAItuProbableCause object defined within <xref target="RFC3877"/> 
            and any subsequent extensions defined by IANA. For example, IANAItuProbableCause defines a
            transmission failure to a probable cause of 'transmissionError (10)'. The value of the
            parameter in this case would be 'transmissionError'.</t>
</section>      

<section title="perceivedSeverity">
      <t>If the "alarm" SD-ID is included, the "perceivedSeverity" SD-PARAM MUST be included. Similar to 
   the definition of perceived severity in <xref target="X.736"/> and <xref target="RFC3877"/>,
   this object can take the following values: 
            <list style="symbols">
         <t>cleared</t>
         <t>indeterminate</t>
         <t>critical</t>
         <t>major</t>
         <t>minor </t>
         <t>warning </t>
   </list></t>
      <t>See Section 2 for the relationship between this severity and syslog severity.</t>
</section> 
<section title="eventType">
      <t>If the "alarm" SD-ID is included, the "eventType" SD-PARAM SHOULD be included. This parameter
            is the mnemonic associated with the IANAItuEventType  object defined within <xref target="RFC3877"/> 
            and any subsequent extensions defined by IANA. For example, IANAItuEventType  defines an
            environmental alarm to an event type of 'environmentalAlarm (6)'. The value of the
            parameter in this case would be 'environmentalAlarm'.</t>
</section>  

<section title="trendIndication">
      <t>If the "alarm" SD-ID is included, the "trendIndication"
            SD-PARAM SHOULD be included. Similar to  
            the definition of perceived severity in <xref
            target="X.733"/> and <xref target="RFC3877"/>, 
            this object can take the following values: <list style="symbols">
                  <t>moreSevere </t>
                  <t>noChange </t>
                  <t>lessSevere </t>
            </list></t>
</section>      
      <section title="resourceURI">
            <t>
                  If the "alarm" SD-ID is included, the "resourceURI"
                  SD-PARAM SHOULD
                  be included.    This item uniquely identifies the 
                  resource under alarm.                    
                  </t><t>
                  The value of this field MUST conform to the URI definition in <xref target="RFC3986"/> 
                  and its updates. In the case of an SNMP resource,  the syntax in <xref target="RFC4088"/> MUST be 
                        used and "resourceURI" must point to the same resource                 
                  as alarmActiveResourceId <xref target="RFC3877"/> for this alarm. 
                  
            </t>
            <t>	Both the "resource" and the "resourceURI" parameters point at the resource experiencing the 
                  alarm, but the "resourceURI" has syntactic constraint requiring it to be a URI.  
                  This makes it easy to correlate this syslog alarm with any alarms that are received via other 
                  protocols, such as SNMP, or 
                  to use SNMP or other protocols to get additional information about this resource.</t>

The alarm SD-ID contains the mandatory SD-PARAMS of 
             resource, probableCause, and preceivedSeverity.  The MSG itself is "An application event log entry..."

<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
<t>
	In addition to the general syslog security considerations
	discussed in <xref target="RFC5424"/>, 
      the information contained with alarms may provide hackers with helpful information about
      parts of the system currently experiencing stress as well as general information about the
      system, such as inventory.
</t>
<t>
      Users should not have access to information in alarms that their normal access permissions
      would not permit if the information were accessed in another manner.
</t>
      <t>There is no standardized access control model for syslog, and
      hence the ability to filter alarms based on a notion of a
      receiver identity is, at best, implementation specific.</t>
