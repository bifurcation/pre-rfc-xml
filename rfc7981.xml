      <t>This document defines a new optional Intermediate System to
      Intermediate System (IS-IS) TLV named CAPABILITY, formed of multiple
      sub-TLVs, which allows a router to announce its capabilities within an

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>There are several situations where it is useful for the IS-IS
      <xref target="ISO10589"/> <xref target="RFC1195"/> routers to learn the capabilities of the other
      routers of their IS-IS level, area, or routing domain. For the sake of
      illustration, three examples related to MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE)
      are described here:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Mesh-group: The setting up of a mesh of TE Label Switched Paths
          (LSPs) <xref target="RFC5305"/> requires some significant configuration effort.
          <xref target="RFC4972"/> proposes an auto-discovery mechanism whereby every Label
          Switching Router (LSR) of a mesh advertises its mesh-group
          membership by means of IS-IS extensions.</t>

          <t>Point-to-Multipoint TE LSP (RFC4875): A specific sub-TLV
          <xref target="RFC5073"/> allows an LSR to advertise its Point-to-Multipoint
          capabilities (<xref target="RFC4875"/> and <xref target="RFC4461"/>).</t>

          <t>Inter-area traffic engineering: Advertisement of the IPv4 and/or
          the IPv6 Traffic Engineering Router IDs.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The use of IS-IS for Path Computation Element (PCE) discovery may
      also be considered and will be discussed in the PCE WG.</t>

      <t>The capabilities mentioned above require the specification of new
      sub-TLVs carried within the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV defined in this document.</t>

      <t>Note that the examples above are provided for the sake of
      illustration. This document proposes a generic capability advertising
      mechanism that is not limited to MPLS Traffic Engineering.</t>

      <t>This document defines a new optional IS-IS TLV named CAPABILITY,
      formed of multiple sub-TLVs, which allows a router to announce its
      capabilities within an IS-IS level or the entire routing domain. The
      applications mentioned above require the specification of new sub- TLVs
      carried within the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV defined in this document.</t>

      <t>Definition of these sub-TLVs is outside the scope of this
      document.</t>
    
    <section title="Requirements Language">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

    </section>
</section>
    <section anchor="router" title="IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV">
      <t>The IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV is composed of 1 octet for the type,
      1 octet that specifies the number of bytes in the value field, and a
      variable length value field that starts with 4 octets of Router ID,
      indicating the source of the TLV, followed by 1 octet of flags.</t>

      <t>A set of optional sub-TLVs may follow the flag field. Sub-TLVs are
      formatted as described in <xref target="RFC5305"/>.</t>

      <t><figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[ TYPE: 242
   LENGTH: from 5 to 255
   VALUE:
     Router ID (4 octets)
     Flags (1 octet)
     Set of optional sub-TLVs (0-250 octets)

 Flags

             0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

             | Reserved  |D|S|
             +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

]]></artwork>
        </figure></t>

      <t>Currently, two bit flags are defined.</t>


      <t>S bit (0x01): If the S bit is set(1), the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV
      MUST be flooded across the entire routing domain. If the S bit is not
      set(0), the TLV MUST NOT be leaked between levels. This bit MUST NOT be
      altered during the TLV leaking.</t>


      <t>D bit (0x02): When the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV is leaked from
      Level 2 (L2) to Level 1 (L1), the D bit MUST be set. Otherwise, this bit MUST be
      clear. IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLVs with the D bit set MUST NOT be
      leaked from Level 1 to Level 2. This is to prevent TLV looping.</t>

      <t>The IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV is OPTIONAL. As specified in <xref target="IANA"/>,
      more than one IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV from the same source MAY be
      present.</t>

      <t>This document does not specify how an application may use the IS-IS Router
      CAPABILITY TLV, and such specification is outside the scope of this
      document.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="Elements of Procedure">
      <t>The Router ID SHOULD be identical to the value advertised in the
      Traffic Engineering Router ID TLV <xref target="RFC5305"/>. If no Traffic Engineering
      Router ID is assigned, the Router ID SHOULD be identical to an IP
      Interface Address <xref target="RFC1195"/> advertised by the originating IS. If the
      originating node does not support IPv4, then the reserved value 0.0.0.0
      MUST be used in the Router ID field, and the IPv6 TE Router ID sub-TLV
      <xref target="RFC5316"/> MUST be present in the TLV. IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLVs that have
      a Router ID of 0.0.0.0 and do NOT have the IPv6 TE Router ID sub-TLV
      present MUST NOT be used.</t>

      <t>When advertising capabilities with different flooding scopes, a
      router MUST originate a minimum of two IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLVs, each TLV
      carrying the set of sub-TLVs with the same flooding scope. For instance,
      if a router advertises two sets of capabilities, C1 and C2, with an
      area/level scope and routing domain scope respectively, C1 and C2 being
      specified by their respective sub-TLV(s), the router will originate two
      IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLVs:

      <list style="symbols"><t>One IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV with the S flag cleared, carrying the
    sub-TLV(s) relative to C1. This IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV will not be
    leaked into another level.</t>

    <t>One IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV with the S flag set, carrying the sub-
    TLV(s) relative to C2.  This IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV will be leaked
    into other IS-IS levels.  When the TLV is leaked from Level 2 to
    Level 1, the D bit will be set in the Level 1 LSP advertisement.</t>
  </list>
     </t>

      <t>In order to prevent the use of stale IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLVs, a system MUST
      NOT use an IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV present in an LSP of a system that is not
      currently reachable via Level x paths, where "x" is the level (1 or 2)
      in which the sending system advertised the TLV. This requirement applies
      regardless of whether or not the sending system is the originator of the
      IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV.</t>

      <t>When an IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV is not used, either due to a lack of reachability
      to the originating router or due to an unusable Router ID, note that
      leaking the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV is one of the uses that is prohibited under
      these conditions.

<list><t>
      Example: If Level 1 router A generates an IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV and 
      floods it to two L1/L2 routers, S and T,
      they will flood it into the Level 2 domain.  Now suppose the
      Level 1 area partitions, such that A and S are in one partition
      and T is in another. IP routing will still continue to work,
      but if A now issues a revised version of the CAP TLV, or decides
      to stop advertising it, S will follow suit, but without the above
      prohibition, T will continue to advertise the old version until the
      LSP times out. </t>

      <t>Routers in other areas have to choose whether to trust T's copy of
      A's IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV or S's copy of A's IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV, and they have
      no reliable way to choose. By making sure that T stops leaking A's
      information, the possibility that other routers will use stale
      information from A is eliminated.</t>
</list>
</t>

      <t>In IS-IS, the atomic unit of the update process is a TLV -- or more
      precisely, in the case of TLVs that allow multiple entries to appear in
      the value field (e.g., IS-neighbors), the atomic unit is an entry in the
      value field of a TLV. If an update to an entry in a TLV is advertised in
      an LSP fragment different from the LSP fragment associated with the old
      advertisement, the possibility exists that other systems can temporarily
      have either 0 copies of a particular advertisement or 2 copies of a
      particular advertisement, depending on the order in which new copies of
      the LSP fragment that had the old advertisement and the fragment that
      has the new advertisement arrive at other systems.</t>

      <t>Wherever possible, an implementation SHOULD advertise the update to an
      IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV in the same LSP fragment as the advertisement that it
      replaces. Where this is not possible, the two affected LSP fragments
      should be flooded as an atomic action.</t>

      <t>Systems that receive an update to an existing IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV can
      minimize the potential disruption associated with the update by
      employing a holddown time prior to processing the update so as to allow
      for the receipt of multiple LSP fragments associated with the same
      update prior to beginning processing.</t>

      <t>Where a receiving system has two copies of an IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV from the
      same system that have conflicting information for a given sub-TLV, the
      procedure used to choose which copy shall be used is undefined.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Interoperability with Routers Not Supporting the IS-IS
		    Router CAPABILITY TLV">
      <t>Routers that do not support the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV MUST silently
      ignore the TLV(s) and continue processing other TLVs in the same LSP.
      Routers that do not support specific sub-TLVs carried within an IS-IS Router
      CAPABILITY TLV MUST silently ignore the unsupported sub-TLVs and
      continue processing those sub-TLVs that are supported in the IS-IS Router
      CAPABILITY TLV. How partial support may impact the operation of the
      capabilities advertised within the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV is outside the
      scope of this document.</t>


      <t>In order for IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLVs with domain-wide scope originated
      by L1 routers to be flooded across the entire domain, at least one L1/L2
      router in every area of the domain MUST support the Router CAPABILITY
      TLV.</t>

      <t>If leaking of the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV is required, the entire CAPABILITY
      TLV MUST be leaked into another level without change (except for changes
      to the TLV flags as noted in <xref target="router"/>) even though it may contain some
      sub-TLVs that are unsupported by the router doing the leaking.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Any new security issues raised by the procedures in this document
      depend upon the opportunity for LSPs to be snooped and modified, the
      ease/difficulty of which has not been altered. As the LSPs may now
      contain additional information regarding router capabilities, this new
      information would also become available to an attacker. Specifications
      based on this mechanism need to describe the security considerations
      around the disclosure and modification of their information. Note that
      an integrity mechanism, such as the ones defined in <xref target="RFC5304"/> or
      <xref target="RFC5310"/>, should be applied if there is high risk resulting from
      modification of capability information.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">


      <t>
IANA originally assigned a TLV codepoint for the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV
(242) as described in RFC 4971.  IANA has updated this entry in the
"TLV Codepoints Registry" to refer to this document.

    <section title="Changes to RFC 4971">
      <t>This document makes the following changes to RFC 4971.</t>

      <t>RFC 4971 only allowed a 32-bit Router ID in the fixed header of TLV
      242. This is problematic in an IPv6-only deployment where an IPv4
      address may not be available. This document specifies:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>The Router ID SHOULD be identical to the value advertised in the
          Traffic Engineering Router ID TLV (134) if available.</t>

          <t>If no Traffic Engineering Router ID is assigned, the Router ID
          SHOULD be identical to an IP Interface Address <xref target="RFC1195"/> advertised
          by the originating IS.</t>

          <t>If the originating node does not support IPv4, then the reserved
          value 0.0.0.0 MUST be used in the Router ID field, and the IPv6 TE
          Router ID sub-TLV <xref target="RFC5316"/> MUST be present in the TLV.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In addition, some clarifying editorial changes have been made.</t>
