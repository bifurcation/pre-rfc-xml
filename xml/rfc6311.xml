      <t> The IPsec protocol suite is widely used for business-critical network traffic. 
        In order to make IPsec deployments highly available, more scalable, and failure-resistant, 
        they are often implemented as IPsec High Availability (HA) clusters.
        However, there are many issues in IPsec HA clustering, and in
particular in Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) clustering. An earlier
        document, "IPsec Cluster Problem Statement", enumerates the issues encountered in
        the IKEv2/IPsec HA cluster environment. This document resolves these issues with
        the least possible change to the protocol.
      </t>
      
      <t> This document defines an extension to the IKEv2 protocol to solve the main issues of
        "IPsec Cluster Problem Statement" in the commonly deployed hot standby cluster, 
        and provides implementation advice for other issues.
        The main issues solved are the synchronization of IKEv2
        Message ID counters, and of IPsec replay counters.

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t> The IPsec protocol suite, including the Internet Key Exchange
Protocol version 2 (IKEv2), is a major building block of virtual private networks (VPNs).
        In order to make such VPNs highly available, more scalable, and failure-resistant,
        these VPNs are implemented as 
        IKEv2/IPsec Highly Available (HA) clusters. However, there are many issues with the IKEv2/IPsec HA cluster.
        Sections <xref target="issues" format="counter"/>
        and <xref target="sync_problem" format="counter"/> below
        expand on the issues around the IKEv2/IPsec HA cluster solution,
        issues which were first described in the problem statement&nbsp;<xref target="RFC6027"/>.
      </t>
      
      <t> In the case of a hot standby cluster implementation of IKEv2/IPsec-based VPNs,
        the IKEv2/IPsec session is first established between the peer and the 
        active member of the cluster. Later, the active member continuously
syncs/updates the IKE/IPsec security association (SA) state
        to the standby member of the cluster. This 
        primary SA state sync-up takes place upon each SA bring-up and/or rekey.
        Performing the SA state synchronization/update 
        for every single IKE and IPsec message is very costly, so normally it is done periodically.
        As a result, when the failover event happens,
        this is first detected by the standby member and, possibly after a considerable amount of time,
        it becomes the active member.
        During this failover process, the peer is unaware of the failover event, and keeps sending IKE requests
        and IPsec packets 
        to the cluster, as in fact it is allowed to do because of the IKEv2 windowing feature.
        After the newly active member starts, it detects the mismatch in IKE Message 
        ID values and IPsec replay counters and needs to resolve this situation.
        Please see <xref target="sync_problem"/> for more details of the problem. 
      </t>
      
      <t> This document defines an extension to the IKEv2 protocol to solve the main issues of IKE Message ID
        synchronization and IPsec SA replay counter synchronization, and gives 
        implementation advice to address other issues. Following is a summary of the solutions provided in this document:  
      </t>
      
      <t>
      <list style="symbols">
      <t> IKEv2 Message ID synchronization: This is done by syncing up the expected send and receive 
        Message ID values with the peer, and updating the 
        values at the newly active cluster member. 
      </t>
      
      <t> IPsec replay counter synchronization: This is done by incrementing the cluster's outgoing
        SA replay counter values by a "large" number; in addition, the newly active member requests
        the peer to increment the replay counter values it is using for the peer's outgoing traffic.

      </t>
      </list>
      </t>
      
      <t> Although this document describes the IKEv2 Message ID and IPsec replay counter synchronization
        in the context of an IPsec HA cluster, 
        the solution provided is generic and can be used in other scenarios where IKEv2 Message ID or
        IPsec SA replay counter synchronization may be required.
      </t>
      
      <t> Implementations differ on the need to synchronize the IKEv2 Message ID and/or IPsec replay counters.
        Both of these problems are handled separately, using a separate notification for
        each capability. This provides the flexibility of implementing either or both of these solutions.

    <section toc= "default" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
        "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
        <xref target="RFC2119" />.
      </t>
      
      <t> "SA Counter Synchronization" is the informational exchange 
        defined in this document to synchronize the IKEv2/IPsec SA counter
        information between one member of the cluster and the peer. 
      </t>

      <t>
        Some of the terms listed below are reused from  <xref target="RFC6027"/> with further clarification 
        in the context of the current document. 
      </t>
      
      <t>
      <list style="symbols">
      <t> "Hot Standby Cluster", or "HS Cluster", is a cluster where only one of the members is active at any one time. 
        This member is also referred to as the "active" member, whereas the other(s) are referred to as "standby" members.  
        The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) <xref target="RFC5798"/> is one method of building such a cluster. The goal of the hot standby cluster is to
        create the illusion of a single virtual gateway to the peer(s). 
      </t>
      
      <t> "Active Member" is the primary member in the hot standby cluster. It is responsible for forwarding packets
        on behalf of the virtual gateway.
      </t>
      
      <t> "Standby Member" is the primary backup member. This member takes control, i.e., becomes the active member, after
        the failover event. 
      </t>
      
      <t> "Peer" is an IKEv2/IPsec endpoint that maintains an IPsec connection with the hot standby cluster. The peer 
        identifies the cluster by the cluster's (single) IP address. If a failover event occurs, the standby member of the
        cluster becomes active, and the peer normally doesn't notice that failover has taken place.
        Although we treat the peer as a single entity, it may also be a cluster.
      </t>
      
      <t> "Multiple failover" is the situation where, in a cluster with three or more members,
        multiple failover events happen in rapid succession, e.g., from M1 to M2, and then to M3.
        It is our goal that the implementation should be able to handle this situation, i.e., 
        to handle the new failover event even if it is still processing the old failover. 
      </t>
      
      <t> "Simultaneous failover" is the situation where two clusters have an IPsec connection between them,
      and failover happens at both ends at the same time. 
      It is our goal that implementations should be able to handle simultaneous failover. 
      </t>

      <t> "IPsec replay counter" is the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
       Sequence Number or Extended Sequence Number (Section 2.2 of
       <xref target="RFC4303" />), or the respective field in the
       Authentication Header (AH) protocol (Section 2.5 of
       <xref target="RFC4302" />).
      </t>
      </list>
      </t>
      
      <t> The generic term "IKEv2/IPsec SA Counters" is used throughout this document.
      This term refers to both IKEv2 Message ID counters and IPsec replay counters.
      According to the IPsec standards, the IKEv2 Message ID counter is mandatory, and used to ensure reliable delivery
      as well as to protect against message replay in IKEv2; the IPsec SA replay counters are optional,
      and are used to provide the IPsec anti-replay feature. 
      </t>
      <t>Some of these terms are used in the following architectural diagram.</t>

      <t> The main problem areas are solved using the protocol extension defined below,
      starting with <xref target="sync_solution"/>;
        additionally, this section provides implementation advice for other issues in the following
        subsections. Implementers should note that these subsections include a number of 
        new security-critical requirements.</t>
      <section anchor="lotsofstate" title="Large Amount of State">
        <t> Section 3.2 of the problem statement <xref target="RFC6027"/> mentions that a lot of state needs to be 
          synchronized for a cluster to be transparent. The actual volume of that data is very much
          implementation-dependent, and even for the same implementation, the amounts of data may
          vary wildly. An IPsec gateway used for inter-domain VPN with a dozen other gateways, and
          having SAs that are rekeyed every 8 hours, will need a lot less synchronization traffic 
          than a similar gateway used for remote access, and supporting 10,000 clients. This is 
          because counter synchronization is proportional to the number of SAs and requires little 
          data, and the setting up of an SA requires a lot of data. Additionally, remote access IKE 
          and IPsec SA setup tend to happen at a particular time of day, so the example gateway with 
          the 10,000 clients may see 30-50 IKE SA setups per second at 9:00 AM. This would require
          very heavy synchronization traffic over that short period of time.</t>
        <t> If a large volume of traffic is necessary, it may be advisable to use a dedicated
          high-speed network interface for synch traffic. When packet loss can be made extremely low,
          it may be advisable to use a stateless transport such as UDP, to minimize network 
          overhead.</t>
        <t> If these methods are insufficient, it may be prudent that for some SAs the entire 
          state is not synchronized. Instead, only an indication of the SA's existence is
          synchronized. This, in combination with a sticky solution (as described in Section 3.7
          of the problem statement <xref target="RFC6027"/>) ensures that the traffic from a particular peer does not
          reach a different member before an actual failover happens. When that happens, the method
          described in <xref target="RFC6290"/> can be used to 
          quickly force the peer to set up a new SA.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="needmultiple" title="Multiple Members Using the Same SA">
        <t> In a load-sharing cluster of the "duplicate" variety (see Section 3.7 of the problem
          statement <xref target="RFC6027"/>), multiple members may need to send traffic with the same selectors. To actually
          use the same SA, the cluster would have to synchronize the replay counter after every packet,
          and that would impose unreasonable requirements on the synch connection.</t>
        <t> A far better solution would be to not synchronize the outbound SA, and create multiple
          outbound SAs, one for each member. The problem with this option is that the peer might view 
          these multiple parallel SAs as redundant, and tear down all but one of them.</t>
        <t> Section 2.8 of <xref target="RFC5996"/> specifically allows multiple parallel SAs, but 
          the reason given for this is to have multiple SAs with different
Quality of Service (QoS) attributes. So while 
          this is not a new requirement of IKEv2 implementations working with QoS, we re-iterate here that IPsec 
          peers MUST accept the long-term existence of multiple parallel SAs, even when QoS 
          mechanisms are not in use.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="collisions" title="Avoiding Collisions in SPI Number Allocation">
        <t> Section 3.9 of the problem statement <xref target="RFC6027"/> describes the problem of two cluster members 
          allocating the same Security Parameter Index (SPI) number for two
different SAs. This behavior would violate Section&nbsp;4.4.2.1
of <xref target="RFC4301"/>. There are several schemes to allow implementations
          to avoid such collisions, such as partitioning the SPI space, a request-response over
          the synch channel, and locking mechanisms. We believe that these are sufficiently robust
          and available so that we don't need to make an exception to
          the rules in Section 4.4.2.1 of RFC 4301 <xref target="RFC4301"/>,
          and we can leave 
          this problem for the implementations to solve. Cluster members
          must not generate multiple inbound SAs with the same SPI.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="countermodes" title="Interaction with Counter Modes">
            <t> For SAs involving counter mode ciphers such as Counter Mode (CTR) <xref target="RFC3686"/> or 
              Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) <xref target="RFC4106"/>, there is yet another complication. The initial vector 
              for such modes MUST NOT be repeated, and senders may use methods such as counters or 
              linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) to ensure this property. For an SA shared between multiple active members (load-sharing cases),
              implementations MUST ensure that no initial vector is ever repeated.
              Similar concerns apply to an SA failing over from one
              member to another. See <xref target="RFC6054"/> for a discussion of this 
              problem in another context.</t>
            <t> Just as in the SPI collision problem, there are ways to avoid a collision of initial vectors, and this
              is left up to implementations. In the context of load sharing, parallel SAs are a simple solution to this problem as well.</t>

      the peer's stated window size for
        transmitted IKE requests".
      </t>
      
      <t>All IKEv2 messages are required to follow a request-response paradigm. 
        The initiator of an IKEv2 request MUST retransmit the request, until it has received a response from the peer.
        IKEv2 introduces a windowing mechanism that allows multiple requests to be outstanding at a given point of time,
        but mandates
        that the sender's window should not move until the oldest message it has sent is acknowledged.
        Loss of even a single message leads to repeated retransmissions followed by an IKEv2 SA teardown 
        if the retransmissions remain unacknowledged.
      </t>
      
      <t>An IPsec hot standby cluster is required to ensure that in the case of failover, 
        the standby member becomes active immediately.
        The standby member is expected to have the exact value of the Message ID counter as the active member had
        before failover.
        Even assuming the best effort to update the Message ID values from active to standby member, 
        the values at the standby 
        member can still be stale due to the following reasons:
        
        <list style="symbols">         
          
          <t> The standby member is unaware of the last message that was received and acknowledged by the 
            previously active member, as the failover event could have happened before the standby member could be updated.
          </t>
          
          <t> The standby member does not have information about on-going unacknowledged requests sent by
            the previously active member.
            As a result, after the failover event, the newly active member cannot retransmit those requests.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      
      <t> When a standby member takes over as the active member, it can only initialize the Message ID
        values from the previously updated values.
        This would make it reject requests from the peer when these values are stale.
        Conversely, the standby member may end up reusing a stale Message ID value, which would cause
        the peer to drop the request.
        Eventually, there is a high probability of the IKEv2 and corresponding IPsec SAs getting torn down 
        simply because of a 
        transitory Message ID mismatch and retransmission of requests, negating the benefits of
        the high-availability cluster despite the periodic update between the cluster members.
      </t>
      
      
      <t>A similar issue is also observed with IPsec anti-replay counters if anti-replay protection is enabled,
        which is commonly the case. Regardless of how well the ESP and AH SA counters are synchronized from the 
        active to the standby member, there is a chance that the standby member would end up with stale counter values.
        The standby member would then use those stale counter values when sending IPsec packets.
        The peer would drop such packets, since when the anti-replay protection feature is enabled,
        duplicate use of counters is not allowed. Note that IPsec allows the sender to skip 
        some counter values and continue sending with higher counter values.
      </t>
      
      <t>We conclude that a mechanism is required to ensure that the standby member has correct Message ID
        and IPsec counter values when it becomes active, 
        so that sessions are not torn down as a result of mismatched counters.

    <section title="SA Counter Synchronization Solution" anchor="sync_solution" toc="include">
      
      <t>This document defines two separate approaches to resolving the issues of mismatched IKE Message ID values and
      IPsec counter values.</t>
      <t>
      <list style="symbols">
      <t>In the case of IKE Message ID values, the newly active cluster member and the peer
      negotiate a pair of new values so that future IKE messages
      will not be dropped.</t>
      <t>For IPsec counter values, the newly active member and the peer both increment their respective counter values,
      "skipping forward" by a large number, to ensure that no IPsec counters are ever reused.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
      <t>Although conceptually separate, the two synchronization processes would typically take place
      simultaneously.</t>
      
      <t> First, the peer and the active member of the cluster negotiate their ability to
      support IKEv2 Message ID synchronization and/or IPsec replay counter synchronization. This is done by
      exchanging one or both of the IKEV2_MESSAGE_ID_SYNC_SUPPORTED and IPSEC_REPLAY_COUNTER_SYNC_SUPPORTED
      notifications during the IKE_AUTH exchange. When negotiating these capabilities, the responder MUST NOT assert
      support of a capability unless such support was asserted by the initiator. Only a capability whose support
      was asserted by both parties can be used during the lifetime of the SA. The peer's capabilities with regard to this extension
      are part of the IKEv2 SA state, and thus MUST be shared between the cluster members.</t>
      <t>
        This per-IKE SA information is
        shared with the other cluster members.

      <t> After a failover event, the standby member MAY use
        the IKE Message ID and/or IPsec replay counter synchronization capability when it becomes
        the active member, and provided support for the capabilities used has been negotiated.
        Following that, the peer MUST respond to any synchronization message it receives from
        the newly active cluster member, subject to the rules noted below.
      </t>
      
      <t>  After the failover event, when the standby member becomes active, it has to synchronize its SA counters
      with the peer. There are now four possible cases:</t>
      <t>
      <list style="numbers">
      <t>The cluster member wishes to only perform IKE Message ID value synchronization. In this case,
      it initiates an Informational exchange, with Message ID zero and the sole notification IKEV2_MESSAGE_ID_SYNC.</t>
      <t>If the newly active member wishes to perform only IPsec replay counter synchronization, it generates
      a regular IKEv2 Informational exchange using the current Message ID values,
      and containing the IPSEC_REPLAY_COUNTER_SYNC
      notification.</t>
      <t>If synchronization of both counters is needed, the cluster member generates a zero-Message ID message
      as in case #1, and includes both notifications in this message.</t>
      <t>Lastly, the peer may not support this extension. This is known to the newly active member (because
      the cluster members must share this information, as noted earlier).
      This case is the existing IKEv2 behavior, and the IKE and IPsec
      SAs may or may not survive the failover, depending on the exact state on the peer and the cluster member.</t>
      </list>
      </t>

        <t>This figure contains the IKE message exchange used for SA counter synchronization. The following
        subsections describe the details of the sender and receiver processing of each message.</t>

      <section title="Processing Rules for IKE Message ID Synchronization">
        <t>The newly active member sends a request containing two counter values, one for the member (itself) and
        another for the peer, as well as a random nonce. We denote the values M1 and P1.
        The peer responds with a message containing two counter
        values, M2 and P2 (note that the values appear in the opposite order in the notification's payload).
        The goal of the rules below is to prevent an attacker from replaying
        a synchronization message and thereby invalidating IKE messages that are currently in process.</t>
        <t>
        <list style="symbols">
        <t>M1 is the next sender's Message ID to be used by the member. M1 MUST be chosen so that it is larger than
        any value known to have been used. It is RECOMMENDED to increment the known value at least by the
        size of the IKE sender window.</t>
        <t>P1 SHOULD be 1 more than the last Message ID value received from the peer, but may be any higher value.</t>
        <t>The member SHOULD communicate the sent values to the other cluster members, so that if a second
        failover event takes place, the synchronization message is not replayed. Such a replay would result in the eventual
        deletion of the IKE SA (see below).</t>
        <t>The peer MUST silently drop any received synchronization message if M1 is lower than or equal to the highest
        value it has seen from the cluster. This includes any previous received synchronization messages.</t>
        <t>M2 MUST be at least the higher of the received M1, and one more than the highest sender value received
        from the cluster. This includes any previous received synchronization messages.</t>
        <t>P2 MUST be the higher of the received P1 value, and one more than the highest sender value used by the
        peer.</t>
        <t>The request contains a Nonce field. This field MUST be returned in the response, unchanged.
        A response MUST be silently dropped if the received nonce does not match the one that was sent.</t>
        <t>Both the request and the response MUST NOT contain any additional payloads, other than an optional
        IPSEC_REPLAY_COUNTER_SYNC notification in the request.</t>
        <t>The request and the response MUST both be sent with a Message ID value of zero.</t>
        </list>
        </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Processing Rules for IPsec Replay Counter Synchronization">
      <t>Upon failover, the newly active member MUST increment its own replay counter
      (the counter used for outgoing traffic),
      so as to prevent the case of its traffic being dropped by the peer as replay. We note that
      IPsec allows the replay counter to skip forward by any amount. The estimate is based on the
      outgoing IPsec bandwidth and the frequency of synchronization between cluster members.
      In those implementations where it is difficult to estimate this value,
      the counter can be incremented by a very large number, e.g., 2**30.
      In the latter case, a rekey SHOULD follow shortly afterwards, to ensure that the counter never wraps around.</t>
      <t>Next, the cluster member estimates the number of incoming messages it might have missed,
      using similar logic. The member sends out an IPSEC_REPLAY_COUNTER_SYNC notification, either
      stand-alone or together with an IKEV2_MESSAGE_ID_SYNC notification.</t>
      <t>If the IPSEC_REPLAY_COUNTER_SYNC is included in the same message as IKEV2_MESSAGE_ID_SYNC, the peer MUST
      process the Message ID notification first (which might cause the entire message to be dropped as a replay).
      Then, it MUST increment the replay counters for all Child SAs associated with the current IKE SA
      by the amount requested by the cluster member.</t>

      <t> This protocol does not change any of the existing IKEv2 rules regarding Message ID values.</t>
      
      <t>
            The standby member can initiate the synchronization of IKEv2 Message IDs under different circumstances.
        <list style="symbols"> 
          
          <t>  When it receives a problematic IKEv2/IPsec packet, i.e., a packet outside its expected receive window.</t>
          <t> When it has to send the first IKEv2/IPsec packet after a failover event.</t>
          <t>  When it has just received control from the active member and wishes to update the values proactively,
            so that it need not start this exchange later, when sending or receiving the request.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t> To clarify the first alternative:
          the normal IKE behavior of rejecting out-of-window messages is not changed, but such messages can still be a valid trigger
          for the exchange defined in this document. To avoid denial-of-service
(DoS) attacks resulting from replayed messages,
          the peer MUST NOT initiate counter
          synchronization for any particular IKE SA more than once per failover event.</t>
      <t>
            The standby member can initiate the synchronization of IPsec SA replay counters:
        <list style="symbols"> 
          
          <t>  If there has been traffic using the IPsec SA in the recent past and the standby member
            suspects that its replay counter may be stale.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      
      <t> Since there can be a large number of sessions at the standby member, and sending synchronization 
        exchanges for all of them may result in overload, the standby member can choose to initiate
        the exchange in a "lazy" fashion: only when it has to
        send or expects to receive traffic from each peer. In general, the standby member is free to initiate this exchange at its discretion.
        Implementation considerations include the ability to survive a certain amount of traffic loss, and the capacity
        of a cluster member to initiate counter synchronization simultaneously with a large number of peers.
      </t>

<section title="IKE SA and IPsec SA Message Sequencing">
<t>The straightforward definitions of message sequence numbers, retransmissions, and replay protection in IPsec and IKEv2
are strained by the failover scenarios described in this document. This section describes some policy choices
that need to be made by implementations in this setting.</t>
<section title="Handling of Pending IKE Messages">
<t>After sending its "receive" counter, the cluster member MUST reject (silently drop) any incoming IKE messages that
are outside its declared window. A similar rule applies to the peer. Local policies vary, and strict implementations
will reject any incoming IKE message arriving before Message ID synchronization is complete.</t>
</section>
<section title="Handling of Pending IPsec Messages">
<t>For IPsec, there is often a trade-off between security and reliability of the protected protocols.
Here again, there is some leeway for local policy. Some
implementations might accept incoming traffic that is outside the replay window for some time after the failover
event, and until the counters had been synchronized. Strict implementations will only accept traffic
that's inside the "safe" window.</t>
</section>
<section title="IKE SA Inconsistencies">
<t>IKEv2 is normally a reliable protocol. As long as an IKE SA is valid, both peers share a single, consistent
view of the IKE SA and all associated Child SAs. Failover situations as described in this document may involve
forced deletion of IKE messages, resulting in inconsistencies,
such as Child SAs that exist on only one of the peers. Such SAs might cause an INVALID_SPI to be returned
when used by that peer. Note that Section 1.5 of <xref target="RFC5996"/> allows but does not mandate sending
an INVALID_SPI notification in this case.</t>
<t>The IPsecME Working Group discussed at some point a proposed set of rules for dealing with such situations. However,
we believe that these situations should be rare in practice; as a result, the "default" behavior of tearing
down the entire IKE SA is to be preferred over the complexity of dealing with a multitude of edge cases.

        This section goes through the sequence of steps of a typical failover event,
        looking at a case where the IKEv2 Message ID 
        values are synchronized.
        
        <list style="symbols">    
          
          <t> The active cluster member and the peer device establish the session.
          They both announce the capability to synchronize counter information 
            by sending the IKEV2_MESSAGE_ID_SYNC_SUPPORTED notification in the IKE_AUTH exchange.
          </t>
          
          <t> Some time later, the active member dies, and a standby member takes over.
            The standby member sends its own idea of the IKE Message IDs (both incoming and outgoing)
            to the peer in an Informational
            message exchange with Message ID zero. 
          </t>
          
          <t> The peer first authenticates the message. 
            The peer compares the received values with the values available locally and picks the higher value.
            It then updates its Message IDs with the higher values and also proposes the same values in its response.
          </t>
          
          <t>The peer should not wait for any pending responses while responding with the new Message ID values.
            For example, if the window size is 5 and the peer's window is 3-7, and if the peer has sent
            requests 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 and received responses only for 4, 5, 6,
and 7 but not for 3, 
            then it should include the value 8 in its EXPECTED_SEND_REQ_MESSAGE_ID payload
            and should not wait for a response to message 3 any more.
          </t>
          
          <t>  Similarly, the peer should also not wait for pending (incoming) requests.
            For example, if the window size is 5 and 
            the peer's window is 3-7, and if the peer has received requests 4,
5, 6, and 7 but not 3,
            then it should send the value 8 in the 
            EXPECTED_RECV_REQ_MESSAGE_ID payload, and should not expect to
receive message 3 any more.

    <section title="Interaction with Other Specifications" toc="default">
      <t>
        The usage scenario of this IKEv2/IPsec SA counter synchronization solution is that an 
        IKEv2 SA has been established between 
        the active member of a hot standby cluster and a peer, followed by a failover event occurring and
        the standby member 
        becoming active. The solution further assumes that the IKEv2 SA state was continuously synchronized between 
        the active and standby members of the 
        cluster before the failover event.
        
        <list style="symbols">    
          <t>  
            Session resumption <xref target="RFC5723"/> assumes that a peer (client or initiator) 
            detects the need to re-establish the session. In 
            IKEv2/IPsec SA counter synchronization, it is the newly active member (a gateway or responder)
            that detects the need to synchronize the SA counter after the failover event. 
            Also, in a hot standby cluster, the peer establishes the IKEv2/IPsec session with a single IP address
            that represents the whole cluster, so the peer normally does
            not detect the event of failover in the cluster unless the standby member takes too 
            long to become active and the IKEv2 SA times out by use of the IKEv2
            liveness check mechanism. To conclude, session resumption and SA counter synchronization 
            after failover are mutually exclusive: they are not expected to be used together, and both features can coexist
            within the same implementation without affecting each other.
          </t>
          <t> 
            The IKEv2 Redirect mechanism for load balancing <xref target="RFC5685"/> can be used 
            either during the initial stages of SA setup (the IKE_SA_INIT and IKE_AUTH exchanges) or after session 
            establishment. SA counter synchronization is only useful after the IKE SA has been established 
            and a failover event has occurred.
            So, unlike Redirect, it is irrelevant during the first two exchanges. 
            Redirect after the session has been established is mostly useful for timed
            or planned shutdown/maintenance. A real failover event cannot be detected by the active member 
            ahead of time, and so using 
            Redirect after session establishment is not possible in the case of failover. 
            So, Redirect and SA counter synchronization after failover are mutually exclusive, in the sense described above.
          </t>
          
          <t> IKEv2 Failure Detection <xref target="RFC6290"/>
            solves a similar problem where the peer can rapidly detect that a cluster member has 
            crashed based on a token. It is unrelated to the current scenario, because the goal in
            failover is for the peer not to notice that a failure has occurred.

      <t>
        Since Message ID synchronization messages need to be sent with Message ID zero, they are potentially
        vulnerable to replay attacks. Because of the semantics of this protocol, 
        these can only be denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and we are aware of two variants.
        
        <list style="symbols">    
          <t>  Replay of Message ID synchronization request:
            
            This is countered by the requirement that the Send counter sent by the cluster member should
            always be monotonically increasing, a rule that the peer enforces by silently dropping messages
            that contradict it. 
          </t>
          <t> Replay of the Message ID synchronization response:
            This is countered by sending the nonce data along with the synchronization payload.
            The same nonce
            data has to be returned in the response.  Thus, the standby member will accept a reply only for the current request.
            After it receives a valid response, it MUST NOT process the same response again and MUST discard 
            any additional responses.
          </t>

      </t>
       <t>As mentioned in <xref target="triggers"/>, triggering counter synchronization by out-of-window,

      <t>
        This (non-normative) section presents some examples that illustrate how the IKEv2 Message ID values 
        are synchronized.
        We use a tuple notation, denoting the two counters EXPECTED_SEND_REQ_MESSAGE_ID and EXPECTED_RECV_REQ_MESSAGE_ID
        on each protocol party as (EXPECTED_SEND_REQ_MESSAGE_ID, EXPECTED_RECV_REQ_MESSAGE_ID). 
      </t>
      <t> Note that if the IKE message counters are already synchronized (as in the first example), we expect
        the numbers to be reversed between the two sides. If one protocol party intends to send the next request as 4, then 
        the other expects the next received request to be 4.</t>
