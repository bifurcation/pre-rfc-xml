    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines an extension to the Internet Message
      Access Protocol (IMAP) LIST 
      command that allows the client to request the set of rights that
      the logged-in user has been granted on mailboxes, along with other
      information typically returned by the LIST command.</t>

    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t><xref target='RFC3501'>IMAP</xref> clients typically fetch
      the set of rights granted on
      mailboxes so they can expose the allowed functionality to the
      logged-in user.  In order to do that, the client is 
      forced to issue a LIST or LSUB command to list all available
      mailboxes, followed by a MYRIGHTS command for each mailbox
      found.  This document defines an extension to the to IMAP LIST
      command that is identified by the capability string
      "LIST-MYRIGHTS".  The LIST-MYRIGHTS extension allows the client
      to request the set of rights that the logged-in user has been
      granted on mailboxes, along with other information typically
      returned by the LIST command.</t>
    </section>

    <section title='Conventions Used in This Document'>
      <t>In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected
      to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the
      client.</t>

        <t>
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
    described in BCP&nbsp;14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> 
    when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
        </t>

    <section title='MYRIGHTS Return Option to LIST Command'
             anchor="myrights">
      <t><xref target='RFC4314'/> defines the MYRIGHTS command, which is
      used by an IMAP client to determine the set of rights that the
      logged-in user has been granted on a given mailbox.  Frequently,
      a client will have to look up the rights for some or all of
      the mailboxes returned by the LIST command.  Doing so in
      multiple MYRIGHTS commands wastes bandwidth and can degrade
      performance if the client does not pipeline the requests.</t>

      <t>This document extends the LIST command with a new "MYRIGHTS"
      <xref target='RFC5258'>return option</xref> that allows the client to request all of the
      desired information in a single command.  For each listable
      mailbox matching the list pattern and selection options, the
      server MUST return an untagged LIST response and SHOULD also
      return an untagged MYRIGHTS response containing the set of
      rights granted to the logged-in user.  The ordering of the
      responses is significant only in that the server MUST NOT send a
      MYRIGHTS response for a given mailbox before it sends the LIST
      response for that mailbox.</t> 

      <t>If the server is unable to look up the set of rights for a
      given mailbox, it does not send the MYRIGHTS reply for that
      mailbox.</t>

      <t>Client authors ought to note that generating the MYRIGHTS
      responses for a large number of mailboxes may be an expensive
      operation for the server.  Clients SHOULD use a suitable match
      pattern and/or selection option to limit the set of mailboxes
      returned to only those in whose rights they are
      interested.</t>

    <section title='Examples'>

      <figure>
	<preamble>
	  In this example, the "bar" mailbox doesn't exist, so it has
          no MYRIGHTS reply.
	</preamble>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
C: A01 LIST "" % RETURN (MYRIGHTS)
S: * LIST () "." "INBOX"
S: * MYRIGHTS "INBOX" lrswipkxtecda
S: * LIST () "." "foo"
S: * MYRIGHTS "foo" lrs
S: * LIST (\NonExistent) "." "bar"
S: A01 OK List completed.
]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <figure>
	<preamble>
	  In this example, the LIST reply for the "foo" mailbox is
          returned because it has matching children, but no MYRIGHTS
          reply is returned, because "foo" itself doesn't match the
          selection criteria.
	</preamble>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
C: A02 LIST (SUBSCRIBED RECURSIVEMATCH) "" % RETURN (MYRIGHTS)
S: * LIST (\Subscribed) "." "INBOX"
S: * MYRIGHTS "INBOX" lrswipkxtecda
S: * LIST () "." "foo" (CHILDINFO ("SUBSCRIBED"))
S: A02 OK List completed.

    <section title='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
      <t>In addition to the security considerations described in <xref
      target="RFC4314" />,
      this extension makes it a bit easier for clients to overload
      the server by requesting MYRIGHTS information for a large number
      of mailboxes.  However, as noted in the introduction,
      existing clients already try to do that by generating a large
      number of MYRIGHTS commands for each mailbox in which they are
      interested.  While performing MYRIGHTS information retrieval for
      big lists of mailboxes, a server implementation needs to make
      sure that it can still serve other IMAP connections and yield
      execution to other connections, when necessary.</t>
