      <t>This memo analyzes provider-to-provider Quality of Service (QoS) agreements suitable for a
      global QoS-enabled Internet. It defines terminology relevant to
      inter-domain QoS models. It proposes a new concept denoted by
      Meta-QoS-Class (MQC). This concept could potentially drive and federate
      the way QoS inter-domain relationships are built between providers. It
      opens up new perspectives for a QoS-enabled Internet that retains, as
      much as possible, the openness of the existing best-effort Internet.</t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>Three different areas can be distinguished in IP QoS service
      offerings. The first area is the single domain where a provider delivers
      QoS services inside the boundaries of its own network. The second area
      is multiple domains where a small set of providers, with mutual business
      interests, cooperate to deliver QoS services inside the boundaries of
      their network aggregate. 

<!-- [rfced]  What does "multi domain" refer to exactly? 
     In previous RFCs, it has been used as an adjective (hyphenated): for example,
     "multi-domain networks", "multi-domain environment", "multi-domain PCE solution".
     We suggest adding "multi domain" to the Terminology section or
     otherwise defining it in the text.
     Authors: "multi domains" means several domains, we have changed "multi domains" in "multiple domains".

-->

      The third area, which has very seldom been put
      forward, is the Internet where QoS services can be delivered from almost
      any source to any destination. Both multiple domains and Internet areas
      deal with inter-domain aspects. However, they differ significantly in
      many ways, such as the number of domains and QoS paths involved, which
      are much higher and dynamic for the Internet area. Multiple domains and
      Internet areas are therefore likely to differ in their respective
      solutions. This memo is an attempt to investigate the Internet area from
      the point of view of provider-to-provider agreements. It provides a
      framework for inter-domain QoS-enabled Internet. </t>

      <t><xref target="MESCAL"></xref>provides a set of requirements to be met
      by any solution aiming to solve inter-domain QoS issues. These
      requirements are not reproduced within this memo. Readers are invited to
      refer to <xref target="MESCAL"></xref> for more elaborated description on the
      requirements.</t>

      <t>This memo shows that for the sake of scalability, providers need not
      be concerned with what occurs more than one hop away (from their Autonomous
      System) when they negotiate inter-domain QoS agreements. They should
      base their agreements on nothing but their local QoS capabilities and
      those of their direct neighbors. This analysis leads us to define
      terminology relevant to inter-domain QoS models. We also introduce a new
      concept denoted by Meta-QoS-Class (MQC) that drives and federates the way
      QoS inter-domain relationships are built between providers. The
      rationale for the MQC concept relies on a universal and common
      understanding of QoS-sensitive applications needs. Wherever end-users are
      connected, they experience the same QoS difficulties and are likely to
      express very similar QoS requirements to their respective providers.
      Globally confronted with the same customer requirements, providers are
      likely to design and operate similar network capabilities.</t>

      <t>MQC brings up a simplified view of the Internet QoS capabilities as a
      set of MQC planes. 
<!-- [rfced] Could "brings" be changed to "creates"?  Or perhaps
      "brings up" or "provides"?
      Authors: "brings up" is fine with us, we've modified the text accordingly. 

 -->

This memo looks at whether the idea of MQC planes can
      be helpful in certain well-known concrete inter-domain QoS issues. The
      focus, however, is on the provider-to-provider QoS agreement framework,
      and the intention is not to specify individual solutions and protocols
      for a full inter-domain QoS system. For discussion of a complete
      architecture based on the notion of parallel Internets that extends and
      generalizes the notion of MQC planes, see <xref
      target="AGAVE"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Note that this document does not specify any protocols or
      systems.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Assumptions" title="Assumptions and Requirements">
      <t>To avoid a great deal of complexity and scalability issues, we assume
      that provider-to-provider QoS agreements are negotiated only for two
      adjacent domains that are directly accessible to each other. 
We also assume, because they exchange traffic, that these
      neighbors are BGP <xref target="RFC4271"></xref> peers. This pairwise
      peering is logical, therefore it can be supported not only on physical
      point-to-point connections but also on Internet exchange points (IXPs),
      where many operators connect to each other using a layer 2 switch.</t>

      <t>The QoS solutions envisaged in this document are exclusively
      solutions suitable for the global Internet. As far as Internet-wide
      solutions are concerned, this document assumes that: <list
          style="symbols">
          <t>Any solutions should apply locally in order to be usable as soon
          as deployed in a small set of domains.</t>

          <t>Any solutions should be scalable in order to allow a global
          deployment to almost all Internet domains, with the ability to
          establish QoS communications between any and all end-users.</t>

          <t>Any solutions should also maintain a best-effort service that
          should remain the preeminent service as a consequence of the
          end-to-end argument <xref target="E2E"></xref>.</t>

          <t>If there is no path available within the requested QoS to reach a
          destination, this destination must remain reachable through the
          best-effort service.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This memo does not place any specific requirements on the
      intra-domain traffic engineering policies and the way they are enforced.
      A provider may deploy any technique to ensure QoS inside its own
      network. This memo assumes only that QoS capabilities inside a
      provider's network can be represented as local-QoS-Classes (l-QCs). When
      crossing a domain, traffic experiences conditions characterized by the
      values of delay, jitter, and packet loss rate that correspond to the
      l-QC selected for that traffic within that domain. Capabilities can
      differ from one provider to another by the number of deployed l-QCs, by
      their respective QoS characteristics, and also by the way they have been
      implemented and engineered.</t>

    <section anchor="weaknesses"
             title="Weaknesses of Provider-to-Provider QoS Agreements Based on SP Chains">
      <t>The objective of this section is to show, by a sort of reductio ad
      absurdum proof, that within the scope of Internet services,
      provider-to-provider QoS agreements should be based on guarantees that
      span a single domain.</t>

      <t>We therefore analyze provider-to-provider QoS agreements based on
      guarantees that span several domains and emphasize their vulnerabilities.
      In this case, the basic service element that a provider offers to its
      neighboring providers is called an IP connectivity service. It uses the
      notion of SP chains.
 We first define what an IP connectivity service is,
      and then we point out several weaknesses of such an approach, especially
      the SP chain trap problem that leads to the so-called Internet
      glaciation era.</t>

      <section anchor="IP_service" title="IP Connectivity Services">
        <t>An IP connectivity service is a (Destination, D, J, L) tuple where
        Destination is a group of IP addresses reachable from the domain of
        the provider offering the service, and (D, J, L) is the QoS
        performance to get from this domain to Destination. Destination is
        typically located in a remote domain.</t>

        </figure>

        <t>In <xref target="Figure_1"></xref>, Provider SPn guarantees provider
        SPn+1 the level of QoS for crossing the whole chain of providers'
        domains (SPn, SPn-1, SPn-2, ...,SP1). SPi denotes a provider as well
        as its domain. The top of the figure is the provider-oriented view;
        the ordered set of providers (SPn, SPn-1, SPn-2, ...,SP1) is called an
        SP chain. The bottom of the figure is the domain-oriented view.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="similarity"
               title="Similarity between Provider and Customer Agreements">
        <t>This approach maps end-users' needs directly to
        provider-to-provider agreements. Providers negotiate agreements to a
        destination because they know customers are ready to pay for QoS
        guaranteed transfer to this destination. As far as service scope is
        concerned, the agreements between providers will resemble the
        agreements between customers and providers. For instance, in <xref
        target="Figure_1"></xref>, SPn can sell to its own customers the same
        IP connectivity service it sells to SPn+1. There is no clear
        distinction between provider-to-provider agreements and
        customer-to-provider agreements.</t>

        <t>In order to guarantee a stable service, redundant SP chains should
        be formed to reach the same destination. When one SP chain becomes
        unavailable, an alternative SP chain should be selected. In the
        context of a global QoS Internet, that would lead to an enormous number
        of SP chains along with the associated agreements.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="liability" title="Liability for Service Disruption">
        <t>In <xref target="Figure_1"></xref>, if SPn+1 sees a disruption in
        the IP connectivity service, it can turn only against SPn, its legal
        partner in the agreement. If SPn is not responsible, in the same way,
        it can only complain to SPn-1, and so on, until the faulty provider is
        found and eventually requested to pay for the service impairment. The
        claim is then supposed to move back along the chain until SPn pays
        SPn+1. The SP chain becomes a liability chain.</t>

        <t>Unfortunately, this process is prone to failure in many cases. In
        the context of QoS solutions suited for the Internet, SP chains are
        likely to be dynamic and involve a significant number of providers.
        Providers (that do not all know each other) involved in the same SP
        chain can be competitors in many fields; therefore, trust
        relationships are very difficult to build. Many complex and critical
        issues need to be resolved: how will SPn+1 prove to SPn that
        the QoS level
        is not the level expected for a scope that can expand well beyond SPn?
        How long will it take to find the guilty domain? Is SPn ready to pay
        SPn+1 for something it does not control and is not responsible
        for?</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="SP_chain" title="SP Chain Trap Leading to Glaciation">
        <t>In <xref target="Figure_1"></xref>, SPn implicitly guarantees SPn+1
        the level of QoS for the crossing of distant domains like SPn-2. As we
        saw in <xref target="similarity"></xref>, SP chains will proliferate.
        A provider is, in this context, likely to be part of numerous SP
        chains. It will see the level of QoS it provides guaranteed by many
        providers it perhaps has never even heard of.</t>

        <t>Any change in a given agreement is likely to have an impact on
        numerous external agreements that make use of it. A provider sees the
        degree of freedom to renegotiate, or terminate, one of its own
        agreements being restricted by the large number of external (to its
        domain) agreements that depend on it. This is what is referred to as
        the "SP chain trap" issue. This solution is not appropriate for
        worldwide QoS coverage, as it would lead to glaciation phenomena,
        causing a completely petrified QoS infrastructure, where nobody could
        renegotiate any agreement.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="MQC_agreements"
             title="Provider-to-Provider Agreements Based on Meta-QoS-Class">
      <t>If a QoS-enabled Internet is deemed desirable, with QoS services
      potentially available to and from any destination, any solution must
      resolve the above weaknesses and scalability problems and find
      alternate schemes for provider-to-provider agreements.</t>

      <section anchor="single_domain" title="Single Domain Covering">
        <t>Due to the vulnerabilities of the SP chain approach, we assume
        provider-to-provider QoS agreements should be based on guarantees
        covering a single domain. A provider guarantees its neighbors only the
        crossing performance of its own domain. In <xref
        target="Figure_2"></xref>, the provider SPn guarantees the provider
        SPn+1 only the QoS performance of the SPn domain. The remainder of
        this document will show that this approach, bringing clarity and
        simplicity into inter-domain relationships, is better suited for a
        global QoS Internet than one based on SP chains.</t>

        <t>It is very important to note that the proposition to limit
        guarantees to only one domain hop applies exclusively to
        provider-to-provider agreements. It does not in any way preclude
        end-to-end guarantees for communications.</t>

        <t>The simple fact that SP chains do not exist makes the AS chain trap
        problem and the associated glaciation threat vanish.</t>

        <t>The liability issue is restricted to a one-hop distance. A provider
        is responsible for its own domain only, and is controlled by all
        the neighbors with whom it has a direct contract.

      <section anchor="l-QC_binding" title="Binding l-QCs">
        <t>When a provider wants to contract with another provider, the main
        concern is deciding which l-QC(s) in its own domain it will bind to
        which l-QC(s) in the neighboring downstream domain. The l-QC binding
        process becomes the basic inter-domain process.</t>

        </figure>

        <t>If one l-QC were to be bound to two (or more) l-QCs, it would be
        very difficult to know which l-QC the packets should select. This
        could imply a flow classification at the border of the domains based
        on granularity as fine as the application flows. For the sake of
        scalability, we assume one l-QC should not be bound to several l-QCs
        <xref target="Lev"></xref>. On the contrary, several l-QCs can be
        bound to the same l-QC, in the way that l-QC23 and l-QC24 are bound to
        l-QC13 in <xref target="Figure_3"></xref>.</t>

        <t>A provider decides the best match between l-QCs based exclusively
        on:</t>

        <t>- What it knows about its own l-QCs;</t>

        <t>- What it knows about its neighboring l-QCs.</t>

        <t>It does not use any information related to what is happening more
        than one domain away.</t>

        <t>Despite this one-hop, short-sighted approach, the consistency and
        the coherency of the QoS treatment must be ensured on an l-QC thread
        formed by neighboring bound l-QCs. Packets leaving a domain that
        applies a given l-QC should experience similar treatment when
        crossing external domains up to their final destination. A provider
        should bind its l-QC with the neighboring l-QC that has the closest
        performance. The criteria for l-QC binding should be stable along any
        l-QC thread. For example, two providers should not bind two l-QCs to
        minimize the delay whereas further on, on the same thread, two other
        providers have bound two l-QCs to minimize errors. Constraints
        should be put on l-QC QoS performance parameters to confine their
        values to an acceptable and expected level on an l-QC thread scale.
        These constraints should depend on domain size; for example,
        restrictions on delay should authorize a bigger value for a national
        domain than for a regional one. Some rules must therefore be defined
        to establish in which conditions two l-QCs can be bound together.
        These rules are provided by the notion of Meta-QoS-Class (MQC).</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="MQC_binding" title="MQC-Based Binding Process">
        <t>An MQC provides the limits of the QoS parameters two l-QCs must
        respect in order to be bound together. A provider goes through several
        steps to extend its internal l-QCs through the binding process.
        Firstly, it classifies its own l-QCs based on MQCs. An MQC is used as
        a label that certifies the support of a set of applications that bear
        similar network QoS requirements. It is a means to make sure that an
        l-QC has the appropriate QoS characteristics to convey the traffic of
        this set of applications. Secondly, it learns about available MQCs
        advertised by its neighbors. To advertise an MQC, a provider must have
        at least one compliant l-QC and should be ready to reach agreements to
        let neighbor traffic benefit from it. Thirdly, it contracts an
        agreement with its neighbor to send some traffic that will be handled
        according to the agreed MQCs.</t>

        <t>The following attributes should be documented in any specification
        of an MQC. This is not a closed list, other attributes can be added if
        needed.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>A set of applications (e.g., VoIP) the MQC is particularly
            suited for.</t>

            <t>Boundaries or intervals of a set of QoS performance attributes
            whenever required. For illustration purposes, we propose to use in
            this document attribute (D, J, L) 3-tuple. 
An MQC could be focused
            on a single parameter (e.g., suitable to convey delay sensitive
            traffic).
<!-- [rfced] Please clarify "low-delay sensible". Should it be "delay sensitive"?
      Authors: yes it should be, we've changed the text accordingly. 

 -->

 Several levels could also be specified depending on the
            size of the network provider; for instance, a small domain (e.g.,
            regional) needs lower delay than a large domain (e.g., national) to
            match a given MQC.</t>

            <t>Constraints on traffic (e.g., only TCP-friendly).</t>

            <t>Constraints on the ratio: network resources for the class /
            overall traffic using this class (e.g., less resources than peak
            traffic).</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Two l-QCs can be bound together if, and only if, they conform to
        the same MQC.</t>

        <t>Provider-to-provider agreements, as defined here, are
        uni-directional. They are established for transporting traffic in a
        given direction. However, from a business perspective, it is likely
        that reverse agreements will also be negotiated for transporting
        traffic in the opposite direction. Note that uni-directional
        provider-to-provider agreements do not preclude having end-to-end
        services with bi-directional guarantees, when you consider the two
        directions of the traffic separately.</t>

        <t>Two providers negotiating an agreement based on MQC will have to
        agree on several other parameters that are outside the definition of
        MQC. One such obvious parameter is bandwidth. The two providers agree
        to exchange up to a given level of QoS traffic. This bandwidth level
        can then be further renegotiated, inside the same MQC agreement, to
        reflect an increase in the end-user QoS requests. Other clauses of
        inter-domain agreements could cover availability of the service, time
        of repair, etc.</t>

        <t>A hierarchy of MQCs can be defined for a given type of service
        (e.g., VoIP with different qualities: VoIP for residential and VoIP for
        business). A given l-QC can be suitable for several MQCs (even outside
        the same hierarchy). Several l-QCs in the same domain can be
        classified as belonging to the same MQC. There is an MQC with no
        specific constraints called the best-effort MQC.</t>

        <t>There is a need for some form of standardization to control QoS
        agreements between providers <xref target="RFC3387"></xref>. Each
        provider must have the same understanding of what a given MQC is
        about. We need a global agreement on a set of MQC standards. The
        number of classes to be defined must remain very small to avoid
        overwhelming complexity. We also need a means to certify that the l-QC
        classification made by a provider conforms to the MQC standards. So
        the standardization effort should be accompanied by investigations on
        conformance testing requirements.</t>

        <t>The three notions of PDB, Service Class <xref
        target="RFC4594"></xref>, and MQC are related; what MQC brings is the
        inter-domain aspect:</t>

        <t>- PDB is how to engineer a network;</t>

        <t>- Service Class is a set of traffic with specific QoS requests;</t>

        <t>- MQC is a way to classify the QoS capabilities (l-QCs, through
        Diffserv or any other protocols or mechanisms) in order to reach
        agreements with neighbors. MQCs are only involved when a provider
        wants to negotiate an agreement with a neighboring provider. MQC is
        completely indifferent to the way networks are engineered as long as
        the MQC QoS attribute (e.g., (D, J, L)) values are reached.</t>

    <section anchor="MQC_planes" title="The Internet as MQC Planes">
      <t>The resulting QoS Internet can be viewed as a set of parallel
      Internets or MQC planes. Each plane consists of all the l-QCs bound
      according to the same MQC. An MQC plane can have holes and isolated
      domains because QoS capabilities do not cover all Internet domains. When
      an l-QC maps to several MQCs, it belongs potentially to several
      planes.</t>

      <t>When a provider contracts with another provider based on the use of
      MQCs, it simply adds a logical link to the corresponding MQC plane. This
      is basically what current traditional inter-domain agreements mean for
      the existing Internet. <xref target="Figure_4"> </xref>a) depicts the

      maybe has or not" to "SP3 may or may not have one".  Does it 
      convey your intended meaning? 
      Authors: Yes it perfectly does.

-->

 A bi-directional
      agreement exists between SP1 and SP2, SP1 and SP4, SP2 and SP4.</t>

      <t>MQC brings a clear distinction between provider-to-provider and
      customer-to-provider QoS agreements. We expect a great deal of
      difference in dynamicity between the two. Most provider-to-provider
      agreements should have been negotiated, and should remain stable, before
      end-users can dynamically request end-to-end guarantees. Provider
      agreements do not directly map end-users' needs; therefore, the number of
      provider agreements is largely independent of the number of end-user
      requests and does not increase as dramatically as with SP chains.</t>

      <t>For a global QoS-based Internet, this solution will work only if
      MQC-based binding is largely accepted and becomes a current practice.
      This limitation is due to the nature of the service itself, and not to
      the use of MQCs. Insofar as we target global services, we are bound to
      provide QoS in as many SP domains as possible. However, any MQC-enabled
      part of the Internet that forms a connected graph can be used for QoS
      communications and can be extended. Therefore, incremental deployment is
      possible, and leads to incremental benefits. For example, in <xref
      target="Figure_4"></xref> b), as soon as SP3 connects to
      the MQC plane it will be able to benefit from the SP1, SP2, and SP4 QoS
      capabilities.</t>

      <t>The Internet, as a split of different MQC planes, offers an ordered and
      simplified view of the Internet QoS capabilities. End-users can select
      the MQC plane that is the closest to their needs, as long as there is a
      path available for the destination. One of the main outcomes of applying
      the MQC concept is that it alleviates the complexity and the management
      burden of inter-domain relationships.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="end_to_end_services"
             title="Towards End-to-End QoS Services">
      <t>Building end-to-end QoS paths, for the purpose of QoS-guaranteed
      communications between end-users, is going a step further in the QoS
      process. The full description of customer-to-provider QoS agreements,
      and the way they are enforced, is outside the scope of this memo.
      However, in this section, we will list some important issues and state
      whether MQC can help to find solutions.</t>

      <t>Route path selection within a selected MQC plane can be envisaged in
      the same way as the traditional routing system used by Internet routers.
      Thus, we can rely on the BGP protocol, basically one BGP occurrence per
      MQC plane, for the inter-domain routing process. The resilience of the
      IP routing system is preserved. If a QoS path breaks somewhere, the
      routing protocol enables dynamic computation of another QoS path, if
      available, in the proper MQC plane. This provides a first level of QoS
      infrastructure that could be conveniently named "best-effort QoS", even
      if this is an oxymoron.</t>

      <t>On this basis, features can be added in order to select and control
      the QoS paths better. For example, BGP can be used to convey QoS-related
      information, and to implement a process where Autonomous Systems add
      their own QoS values (D, J, L) when they propagate an AS path. Then, the
      AS path information is coupled with the information on Delay, Jitter, and
      Loss, and the decision whether or not to use the path selected by BGP
      can be made, based on numerical values. For example, for destination N,
      an AS path (X, Y) is advertised to AS Z. During the propagation of this
      AS path by BGP, X adds the information concerning its own delay, say
      30 ms, and Y adds the information concerning its own delay, say
      20 ms. Z
      receives the BGP advertisement (X, Y, N, 50 ms). One of Z's customers
      requests a delay of 100 ms to reach N.&nbsp; Z knows its own delay for this
      customer, say 20 ms. Z computes the expected maximum delay from its
      customer to N: 70 ms, and concludes that it can use the AS path (X, Y).
      The QoS value of an AS path could also be disconnected from BGP and
      computed via an off-line process.</t>

      <t>If we use QoS routing, we can incorporate the (D, J, L) information
      in the BGP decision process, but that raises the issue of composing
      performance metrics in order to select appropriate paths <xref
      target="Chau"></xref>. When confronted by multiple incompatible
      objectives, the local decisions made to optimize the targeted
      parameters could give rise to a set of incomparable paths, where no path
      is strictly superior to the others. The existence of
      provider-to-provider agreements based on MQC offers a homogenous view of
      the QoS parameters, and should therefore bring coherency, and restrict
      the risk of such non-optimal choices.</t>

      <t>A lot of end-to-end services are bi-directional, so one must measure
      the composite performance in both directions. Many inter-domain paths
      are asymmetric, and usually, some providers involved in the forward path
      are not in the reverse path, and vice versa. That means that no
      assumptions can be made about the reverse path. Although MQC-based
      provider-to-provider agreements are likely to be negotiated
      bi-directionally, they allow the inter-domain routing protocol to
      compute the forward and the reverse paths separately, as usual. The only
      constraint MQC puts on routing is that the selected paths must use the
      chosen MQCs throughout the selected domains. There might be a different
      MQC requirement in the reverse direction than in the forward direction.
      To address this problem, we can use application-level communication
      between the two parties (customers) involved in order to specify the QoS
      requirements in both directions.</t>

      <t>We can go a step further in the control of the path to ensure the
      stability of QoS parameters such as, e.g., enforcing an explicit
      routing scheme, making use of RSVP-TE/MPLS-TE requests <xref
      target="RFC3209"></xref>, before injecting the traffic into an l-QC
      thread. However, currently, several problems must be resolved before
      ready and operational solutions for inter-domain route pinning,
      inter-domain TE, fast failover, and so forth, are available. For
      example, see the BGP slow convergence problem in <xref
      target="Kushman"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Multicast supports many applications such as audio and video
      distribution (e.g., IPTV, streaming applications) with QoS requirements.
      Along with solutions at the IP or Application level, such as Forward
      Error Correction (FEC), the inter-domain multicast routing protocol with
      Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4 <xref target="RFC4760"></xref>, could
      be used to advertise MQC capabilities for multicast source reachability.
      If an inter-domain tree that spans several domains remains in the same
      MQC plane, it would be possible to benefit from the consistency and the
      coherency conferred by MQC.</t>

      <t>Note that the use of some QoS parameters to drive the route selection
      process within an MQC plane may induce QoS deterioration since the best
      QoS-inferred path will be selected by all Autonomous System
      Border Routers (ASBRs) involved in the
      inter-domain path computation (i.e., no other available routes in the
      same MQC plane will have a chance to be selected). This problem was
      called the QoS Attribute-rush (QA-rush) in <xref target="Grif"></xref>.
      This drawback may be avoided if all involved ASes in the QoS chain
      implement some out-of-band means to control the inter-domain QoS path
      consistency (MQC compliance).
<!-- [rfced] Should it be "out-band means" or "out-of-band means" in
      the sentence above? 
     Authors: It should be "out-of-band means", we've changed the text accordingly.

-->
</t>

      <t>To conclude this section, whatever the protocols we want to use, and
      however tightly we want to control QoS paths, MQC is a concept that can
      help to resolve problems <xref target="WIP"></xref>, without prohibiting
      the use of any particular mechanism or protocol at the data, control, or
      management planes.</t>
