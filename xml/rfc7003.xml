    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines an RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report
      (XR) block that allows the reporting of burst and gap discard metrics
      for use in a range of RTP applications.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <section title="Burst/Gap Discard Metrics Block">
        <t>This document defines a new block type to augment those defined in
        <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> for use in a range of RTP applications.
        The new block type supports the reporting of the proportion of packets
        discarded by the jitter buffer at the receiver, using packet discard
        logic according to the jitter buffer algorithms. The discards during
        discard bursts are reported, together with the number of bursts. This
        block is intended to be used in conjunction with <xref
        target="RFC7002"></xref>, which provides the total packets discarded and
        on which this block therefore depends. However, the metric in <xref
        target="RFC7002"></xref> may be used independently of the metrics in
        this block.</t>

        <t>This block provides information on transient IP problems. Burst/gap
        metrics are typically used in cumulative reports; however, they also
        may be used in interval reports (see the Interval Metric flag in
        Section 3.2). The burstiness of packet discard affects user
        experience, may influence any sender strategies to mitigate the
        problem, and may also have diagnostic value.</t>

        <t>The metric belongs to the class of transport-related end-system
        metrics defined in <xref target="RFC6792"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The definitions of "burst", "gap", "loss", and "discard" are consistent with
        the definitions in <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>. To accommodate the
        range of jitter buffer algorithms and packet discard logic that may be
        used by implementors, the method used to distinguish between bursts
        and gaps shall use an equivalent method to that defined in Section
        4.7.2 of <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>. Note that reporting the
        specific jitter buffer algorithms and/or packet discard logic is out
        of the scope of this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="RTCP and RTCP Extended Reports">
        <t>The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in <xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref>. <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> defined an
        extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended Report (XR).
        This document defines a new Extended Report block for use with <xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Performance Metrics Framework">
        <t>The Performance Metrics Framework <xref target="RFC6390"></xref>
        provides guidance on the definition and specification of performance
        metrics. The RTP Monitoring Framework <xref
        target="RFC6792"></xref> provides guidelines for reporting block format
        using RTCP XR. The metrics block described in this document is in
        accordance with the guidelines in <xref target="RFC6390"></xref> and
        <xref target="RFC6792"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Applicability">
        <t>These metrics are applicable to a range of RTP applications that
        contain de-jitter buffers <xref target="RFC5481"></xref> at the
        receiving end to smooth variation in packet-arrival time and don't
        use stream repair means, e.g., Forward Error Correction (FEC) <xref
        target="RFC5109"></xref> and/or retransmission <xref
        target="RFC4588"></xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

        <t>In addition, the following terms are defined:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Received, Lost, and Discarded"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />A packet shall be regarded as "lost" if it fails to
            arrive within an implementation-specific time window. A packet
            that arrives within this time window but is too early to be
            played out, too late to be played out, or thrown away before
            playout due to packet duplication or redundancy shall be regarded
            as discarded. A packet shall not be regarded as discarded if it
            arrives within this time window but is dropped during decoding by
            some higher-layer decoder, e.g., due to a decoding error. A packet
            shall be classified as one of received (or OK), discarded, or lost.
            The metric "cumulative number of packets lost" defined in <xref
            target="RFC3550"></xref> reports a count of packets lost from the
            media stream (single synchronization source (SSRC) within a single RTP session). Similarly,
            the metric "number of packets discarded" defined in <xref
            target="RFC7002"></xref> reports a count of packets discarded from
            the media stream (single SSRC within a single RTP session) arriving
            at the receiver. Another metric, defined in <xref
            target="RFC5725"></xref>, is available to report on packets that
            are not recovered by any repair techniques that may be in use.
            Note that the term "discard" defined here builds on the "discard"
            definition in <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> but extends the concept
            to take into account packet duplication and reports different
            types of discard counts <xref target="RFC7002"></xref>. </t>

            <t hangText="Bursts and Gaps"><vspace blankLines="1" />The terms
            "burst" and "gap" are used in a manner consistent with that of RTCP XR
            <xref target="RFC3611"/>. RTCP XR views an RTP stream as being divided into
            bursts, which are periods during which the discard rate is high
            enough to cause noticeable quality degradation (generally over 5
            percent discard rate), and gaps, which are periods during which
            discarded packets are infrequent and hence quality is generally
            acceptable. </t>
          </list></t>

    </section>

    <section title="Burst/Gap Discard Metrics Block">
      <t>Metrics in this block report on burst/gap discard in the stream
      arriving at the RTP system. Measurements of these metrics are made at
      the receiving end of the RTP stream. Instances of this metrics block
      use the synchronization source (SSRC) to refer to the separate auxiliary
      Measurement Information Block <xref target="RFC6776"></xref>, which
      describes measurement periods in use (see <xref target="RFC6776"></xref>, Section 4.2).</t>

      <t>This metrics block relies on the measurement period in the
      Measurement Information Block indicating the span of the report. Senders
      MUST send this block in the same compound RTCP packet as the Measurement
      Information Block. Receivers MUST verify that the measurement period is
      received in the same compound RTCP packet as this metrics block. If not,
      this metrics block MUST be discarded.</t>

      <section title="Derived Metrics Based on Reported Metrics">
        <t>The metrics described here are intended to be used in conjunction
        with information from the Measurement Information Block <xref
        target="RFC6776"></xref> and also with the metric "number of packets
        discarded" provided in the RTCP XR Discard Count Metrics Block <xref
        target="RFC7002"></xref>.</t>

        <t>These metrics provide the following information relevant to
        statistical parameters, including:<list style="symbols">
            <t>The fraction of packets discarded during bursts (Burst Discard
            Rate in <xref target="RFC7004"></xref>), which can be calculated
            using the metric "Packets Discarded in Bursts" and the metric
"Total Packets Expected in Bursts" provided in the Burst/Gap
            Discard Metrics Block.</t>

            <t>The fraction of packets discarded during gaps (Gap Discard Rate
            in <xref target="RFC7004"></xref>), which can be calculated using
            the metric "Packets Discarded in Bursts" and the metric "Total
            Packets Expected in Bursts" provided in the Burst/Gap Discard
            Metrics Block.</t>

      </section>

    <section title="Considerations for Voice-over-IP Applications">
      <t>This metrics block is applicable to a broad range of RTP
      applications. Where the metric is used with a Voice-over-IP (VoIP)
      application and the stream repair means is not available, the following
      considerations apply.</t>

      <t>RTCP XR views a call as being divided into bursts, which are periods
      during which the discard rate is high enough to cause noticeable call
      quality degradation (generally over 5 percent discard rate) and gaps,
      which are periods during which discarded packets are infrequent and
      hence call quality is generally acceptable.</t>

      <t>If voice activity detection is used, the burst and gap duration shall
      be determined as if silence packets had been sent, i.e., a period of
      silence in excess of Gmin packets will terminate a burst condition.</t>

      <t>The recommended value for the threshold Gmin in <xref
      target="RFC3611"></xref> results in a burst being a period of time
      during which the call quality is degraded to a similar extent to a
      typical pulse code modulation (PCM) severely errored second.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="SDP Signaling">
      <t><xref target="RFC3611"/> defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol) <xref
      target="RFC4566"></xref> for signaling the use of XR blocks. XR blocks
      MAY be used without prior signaling.</t>

        <t>This section augments the SDP <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>
