<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Constrained devices <xref target="RFC7228"/> are nodes with limited processing power, 
storage space, and transmission capacities.  These devices are often 
battery-powered and in many cases do not provide user interfaces.</t>

<t>Constrained devices benefit from being interconnected using Internet
protocols.  However, deploying common security protocols can sometimes be
difficult because of device or network limitations.  Regardless, adequate
security mechanisms are required to protect these constrained devices, which
are expected to be integrated in all aspects of everyday life, from attackers
wishing to gain control over the device's data or functions.</t>

<t>This document comprises a collection of representative use cases for the
application of authentication and authorization in constrained environments.
These use cases aim at identifying authorization problems that arise during
the life cycle of a constrained device.  Note that this document does not aim
at collecting all possible use cases.</t>

<t>We assume that the communication between the devices is based on the
Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, i.e., a device acts
as a server that offers resources such as sensor data and actuators.  The
resources can be accessed by clients, sometimes without human intervention
(M2M).  In some situations, the communication will happen through 
intermediaries (e.g., gateways, proxies).</t>

<t>Where specific detail is necessary, it is assumed that the devices communicate
using CoAP <xref target="RFC7252"/>, although most conclusions are generic.</t>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

<t>Readers are required to be familiar with the terms defined in
<xref target="RFC7228"/>.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="use-cases" title="Use Cases">

<t>This section includes the use cases; each use case first presents a general
description of the application environment, then one or more specific use
cases, and finally a summary of the authorization-related
problems to be solved. The document aims at listing the relevant
authorization problems and not to provide an exhaustive list. It might
not be possible to address all of the listed problems with a single
solution; there might be conflicting goals within or among some
requirements.</t>


<t>There are various reasons for assigning a function (client or server) to
a device. The function may even change over time; e.g., the device that
initiates a conversation is temporarily assigned the role of client, but
could act as a server in another context.  The definition of the function of a
device in a certain use case is not in scope of this document.  Readers
should be aware that there might be reasons for each setting and that
endpoints might even have different functions at different times.</t>

<section anchor="container_monitoring" title="Container Monitoring">

<t>The ability of sensors to communicate environmental data wirelessly
opens up new application areas.  Sensor systems make it possible to 
continuously track and transmit characteristics such as temperature, humidity, 
and gas content while goods are transported and stored.</t>

<t>Sensors in this scenario have to be associated with the appropriate pallet of the
respective container.  Sensors, as well as the goods, belong to specific 
customers.</t>

<t>While in transit, goods often pass stops where they are transloaded to other 
means of transportation, e.g., from ship transport to road transport.</t>

<t>Perishable goods need to be stored at a constant temperature and with proper
ventilation.  Real-time information on the state of the goods is needed by
both the transporter and the vendor.  Transporters want to prioritize goods that
will expire soon.  Vendors want to react when goods are spoiled to continue to
fulfill delivery obligations.</t>

<t>The Intelligent Container &lt;http://www.intelligentcontainer.com&gt; is an example
project that explores solutions to continuously monitor perishable goods.</t>

<section anchor="bananas-for-munich" title="Bananas for Munich">

<t>A fruit vendor grows bananas in Costa Rica for the German market.  It
instructs a transport company to deliver the goods via ship to
Rotterdam where they are picked up by trucks and transported to a
ripening facility.  A Munich supermarket chain buys ripened bananas
from the fruit vendor and transports them from the ripening facility
to the individual markets with their own company's trucks.</t>

<t>The fruit vendor's quality management wants to assure the quality of
their products; thus, it equips the banana boxes with sensors.  The state of
the goods is monitored consistently during shipment and ripening, and
abnormal sensor values are recorded (U1.2).  Additionally, the sensor values
are used to control the climate within the cargo containers (U1.1, U1.5, U1.7).
Therefore, the sensors need to communicate with the climate-control
system.  Since an incorrect sensor value leads to a wrong temperature, and 
thus to spoiled goods, the integrity of the sensor data must be assured (U1.2,
U1.3).
The banana boxes within a container will, in most cases, belong to the same 
owner.  Adjacent containers might contain goods and sensors of different 
owners (U1.1).</t>

<t>The personnel that transloads the goods must be able to locate the goods meant 
for a specific customer (U1.1, U1.6, U1.7).  However, the fruit vendor does not
want to disclose sensor information pertaining to the condition of the goods 
to other companies and therefore wants to assure the confidentiality of this 
data (U1.4).  Thus, the transloading personnel is only allowed to access 
logistic information (U1.1).  Moreover, the transloading personnel is only 
allowed to access the data for the time of the transloading (U1.8).</t>

<t>Due to the high water content of the fruits, the propagation of radio
waves is hindered, thus often inhibiting direct communication between
nodes <xref target="Jedermann14"/>.  Instead, messages are forwarded over multiple
hops (U1.9). The sensors in the banana boxes cannot always reach the Internet
during the journey (U1.10). Sensors may need to use relay stations
owned by the transport company to connect to endpoints on the Internet.</t>

<t>In the ripening facility bananas are stored until they are ready to be
sold.  The banana box sensors are used to control the ventilation
system and to monitor the degree of ripeness of the bananas. Ripe
bananas need to be identified and sold before they spoil (U1.2, U1.8).</t>

<t>The supermarket chain gains ownership of the banana boxes when the
bananas have ripened and are ready to leave the ripening facility.</t>

<section anchor="authorization-problems-summary" title="Authorization Problems Summary">

<t><list style='format U1.%d:'>
  <t>Fruit vendors and container owners want to grant different 
authorizations for their resources and/or endpoints to different parties.</t>
  <t>The fruit vendor requires the integrity and authenticity of the

the quality of the monitored recordings.</t>
  <t>The container owner requires the integrity and authenticity of
the sensor data that is used for climate control. </t>
  <t>The fruit vendor requires the confidentiality of the sensor data
that pertains the state of the goods and the confidentiality of location
data, e.g., to protect them from targeted attacks from competitors.</t>
  <t>The fruit vendor may need different protection for several different
types of data on the same endpoint, e.g., sensor data and the data used
for logistics.</t>
  <t>The fruit vendor and the transloading personnel require the
authenticity and integrity of the data that is used to locate the goods, in order to 
ensure that the goods are correctly treated and delivered.</t>
  <t>The container owner and the fruit vendor may not be present at
the time of access and cannot manually intervene in the
authorization process.</t>
  <t>The fruit vendor, container owner, and transloading company
want to grant temporary access permissions to a party, in order to avoid
giving permanent access to parties that are no longer involved in processing
the bananas.</t>
  <t>The fruit vendor, container owner, and transloading company want
their security objectives to be achieved, even if the messages
between the endpoints need to be forwarded over multiple hops.</t>
  <t>The constrained devices might not always be able to reach the
Internet but still need to enact the authorization policies of their
principals.</t>
  <t>Fruit vendors and container owners want to be able to revoke
authorization on a malfunctioning sensor.</t>

<section anchor="home_automation" title="Home Automation">

<t>One application of the Internet of Things is home automation systems.<vspace />
Such a system can connect household devices that control, for example, heating,
ventilation, lighting, home entertainment, and home security to the Internet
making them remotely accessible and manageable.</t>

<t>Such a system needs to accommodate a number of regular users (inhabitants,
close friends, cleaning personnel) as well as a heterogeneous group of 
dynamically varying users (visitors, repairmen, delivery men).</t>

<t>As the users are not typically trained in security (or even computer 
use), the configuration must use secure default settings, and the interface
must be well adapted to novice users.</t>

<section anchor="controlling-the-smart-home-infrastructure" title="Controlling the Smart Home Infrastructure">

<t>Alice and Bob own a flat that is equipped with home automation devices such as
HVAC and shutter control, and they have a motion sensor in the corridor that 
controls the light bulbs there (U2.5).</t>

<t>Alice and Bob can control the shutters and the temperature in each
room using either wall-mounted touch panels or an Internet connected
device (e.g., a smartphone).  Since Alice and Bob both have full-time jobs,
they want to be able to change settings remotely, e.g., turn up the heating on
a cold day if they will be home earlier than expected (U2.5).</t>

<t>The couple does not want people in radio range of their devices, e.g., their
neighbors, to be able to control them without authorization.  Moreover,
they don't want burglars to be able to deduce behavioral patterns from
eavesdropping on the network (U2.8).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="seamless-authorization" title="Seamless Authorization">

<t>Alice buys a new light bulb for the corridor and integrates it into the
home network, i.e., makes resources known to other devices in the
network.  Alice makes sure that the new light bulb and her other devices
in the network get to know the authorization policies for the new
device.  Bob is not at home, but Alice wants him to be able to control the new
device with his devices (e.g., his smartphone) without the 
need for additional administration effort (U2.7).  She provides the necessary
configurations for that (U2.9, U2.10).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="remotely-letting-in-a-visitor" title="Remotely Letting in a Visitor">

<t>Alice and Bob have equipped their home with automated connected
door-locks and an alarm system at the door and the windows.  The couple
can control this system remotely.</t>

<t>Alice and Bob have invited Alice's parents over for dinner, but are
stuck in traffic and cannot arrive in time; whereas Alice's parents
are using the subway and will arrive punctually.
Alice calls her parents and offers to let them in remotely, so they can make 
themselves comfortable while waiting (U2.1, U2.6).  Then, Alice sets temporary 
permissions that allow them to open the door and shut down the alarm (U2.2).
She wants these permissions to be only valid for the evening since she does not
like it if her parents are able to enter the house as they see fit (U2.3, 
U2.4).</t>

<t>When Alice's parents arrive at Alice and Bob's home, they use their
smartphone to communicate with the door-lock and alarm system (U2.5, U2.9).
The permissions Alice issued to her parents only allow limited access to the
house (e.g., opening the door, turning on the lights).  Certain other functions,
such as checking the footage from the surveillance cameras, are not accessible to them
(U2.3).</t>

<t>Alice and Bob also issue similarly restricted permissions to e.g., cleaners, repairmen,
or their nanny (U2.3).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="selling-the-house" title="Selling the House">

<t>Alice and Bob have to move because Alice is starting a new job.  They therefore
decide to sell the house and transfer control of all automated services to the
new owners (U2.11).  Before doing so, they want to erase privacy-relevant data 
from the logs of the automated systems, while the new owner is interested to 
keep some historic data e.g., pertaining to the behavior of the heating system 
(U2.12).  At the time of transfer of ownership of the house, the new owners also want to make
sure that permissions issued by the previous owners to access the house or connected
devices (in the case where device management may have separate permissions from 
house access) are no longer valid (U2.13).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="authorization-problems-summary-1" title="Authorization Problems Summary">

<t><list style='format U2.%d:'>
  <t>A home owner (Alice and Bob in the example above) wants to
  spontaneously provision authorization means to visitors.</t>
  <t>A home owner wants to spontaneously change the home's access control 
  policies.</t>
  <t>A home owner wants to apply different access rights for different users
     (including other inhabitants).</t>
  <t>The home owners want to grant access permissions to someone during a specified time frame.</t>
  <t>The smart home devices need to be able to securely communicate with
  different control devices (e.g., wall-mounted touch panels,
  smartphones, electronic key fobs, and device gateways).</t>
  <t>The home owner wants to be able to configure authorization
policies remotely.</t>
  <t>Authorized users want to be able to obtain access with little effort.</t>
  <t>The owners of the automated home want to prevent unauthorized entities
  from being able to deduce behavioral profiles from devices in the home
  network.</t>
  <t>Usability is particularly important in this scenario since the
necessary authorization related tasks in the life cycle of the device
(commissioning, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning) likely
need to be performed by the home owners who, in most cases, have
little knowledge of security.</t>
  <t>Home owners want their devices to seamlessly (and in some
cases even unnoticeably) fulfill their purpose.  Therefore, the authorization
administration effort needs to be kept at a minimum.</t>
  <t>Home owners want to be able to transfer ownership of their automated
  systems when they sell the house.</t>
  <t>Home owners want to be able to sanitize the logs of the automated
  systems when transferring ownership without deleting important
  operational data.</t>
  <t>When a transfer of ownership occurs, the new owner wants to make sure
      that access rights created by the previous owner are no longer valid.</t>

<section anchor="eHealth" title="Personal Health Monitoring">

<t>Personal health monitoring devices, i.e., eHealth devices, are typically battery-driven and located physically on or in the user to monitor some bodily function,
such as temperature, blood pressure, or pulse rate.  These devices typically
connect to the Internet through an intermediary base station, using wireless 
technologies and through this connection they report the monitored data to some
entity, which may either be the user or a medical caregiver.</t>

<t>Medical data has always been considered very sensitive, and therefore
requires good protection against unauthorized disclosure.  A frequent, 
conflicting requirement is the capability for medical personnel to gain
emergency access, even if no specific access rights exist.  As a result, the
importance of secure audit logs increases in such scenarios. </t>

<t>Since the users are not typically trained in security (or even computer use),
the configuration must use secure default settings, and the interface must be 
well adapted to novice users.  Parts of the system must operate with minimal
maintenance.  Especially frequent changes of battery are unacceptable.</t>

<t>There is a plethora of wearable health monitoring technology and the need for
open industry standards to ensure interoperability between products has lead
to initiatives such as Continua Alliance &lt;http://continuaalliance.org&gt; and Personal 
Connected Health Alliance &lt;http://www.pchalliance.org&gt;. </t>

<section anchor="john-and-the-heart-rate-monitor" title="John and the Heart Rate Monitor">

<t>John has a heart condition that can result in sudden cardiac arrests.  He 
therefore uses a device called "HeartGuard" that monitors his heart rate and his 
location (U3.7).  In the event of a cardiac arrest, it automatically sends an alarm 
to an emergency service, transmitting John's current location (U3.1).  Either
the device has long-range connectivity itself (e.g., via GSM) or it uses some
intermediary, nearby device (e.g., John's smartphone) to transmit such an 
alarm.  To ensure John's safety, the device is expected to be in constant 
operation (U3.3, U3.6).</t>

<t>The device includes an authentication mechanism to prevent
other persons who get physical access to it from acting as the owner and
altering the access control and security settings (U3.8).</t>

<t>John can configure a list of people that get notified in an emergency, for
example his daughter Jill.  Furthermore, the device stores data on John's heart 
rate, which can later be accessed by a physician to assess the condition
of John's heart (U3.2).</t>

<t>However, John is a privacy-conscious person and is worried that Jill might use
HeartGuard to monitor his location even when there is no emergency.  Furthermore, he
doesn't want his health insurance to get access to the HeartGuard data, or
even to the fact that he is wearing a HeartGuard, since they might refuse to renew 
his insurance if they decided he was too great of a risk for them (U3.8).</t>

<t>Finally, John, while being comfortable with modern technology and able to 
operate it reasonably well, is not trained in computer security.  Therefore, he
needs an interface for the configuration of the HeartGuard security that is
easy to understand and use (U3.5).  If John does not understand the meaning of
a setting, he tends to leave it alone, assuming that the manufacturer has 
initialized the device to secure settings (U3.4).</t>


<t>Note: Monitoring of some state parameter (e.g., an alarm button) and
the position of a person also fits well into a nursing service context.
This is particularly useful for people suffering from dementia, where the 
relatives or caregivers need to be notified of the whereabouts of the person 
under certain conditions.  In that case, it is not the patient that decides
about access.</t>

  <t>Battery changes are very inconvenient and sometimes impractical, so

<section anchor="building_automation" title="Building Automation">

<t>Buildings for commercial use such as shopping malls or office buildings 
nowadays are equipped increasingly with semi-automatic components to enhance
the overall living quality and to save energy where possible.  This includes
for example heating, ventilation and air condition (HVAC) as well as
illumination and security systems such as fire alarms. These components are
being increasingly managed centrally in a Building and Lighting Management System (BLMS)
by a facility manager.</t>

<t>Different areas of these buildings are often exclusively leased to different
companies.  However, they also share some of the common areas of the building.
Accordingly, a company must be able to control the lighting and HVAC system of 
its own part of the building and must not have access to control rooms that
belong to other companies.</t>

<t>Some parts of the building automation system such as entrance illumination and
fire-alarm systems are controlled either by all parties together or by a
facility-management company.</t>

<section anchor="device-lifecycle" title="Device Life Cycle">

<section anchor="installation-and-commissioning" title="Installation and Commissioning">
<t>Installation of the building automation components often start even before the 
construction work is completed. Lighting is one of the first components to be 
installed in new buildings. A lighting plan created by a lighting designer provides 
the necessary information related to the kind of lighting devices (luminaires, sensors, 
and switches) to be installed along with their expected behavior. The physical 
installation of the correct lighting devices at the right locations are done by 
electricians based on the lighting plan. They ensure that the electrical wiring is 
performed according to local regulations and lighting devices, which may be from multiple manufacturers, are connected to the electrical power supply properly.
After the installation, lighting can be used in a default out-of-box mode, e.g., at full brightness 
when powered on. After this step (or in parallel in a different section of the building), a lighting commissioner adds the devices to the building domain (U4.1) and performs the proper configuration of the lights as prescribed in the lighting plan. This involves, for example, grouping to ensure that light points react together, more or less synchronously (U4.8) and 
defining lighting scenes for particular areas of the building. The commissioning is often 
done in phases, either by one or more commissioners, on different floors. The building lighting network at this stage may be in different network islands with no connectivity between them due to lack of the IT infrastructure. </t>

<t>After this, other building components, like HVAC and security systems, are similarly installed by electricians and later commissioned by their respective domain professionals. Similar configurations related to grouping (U4.8) are required to ensure, e.g., HVAC equipment is controlled by the closest temperature sensor.</t>

<t>For the building IT systems, the Ethernet wiring is initially laid out in the building according to the IT plan. The IT network is often commissioned after the construction is completed to avoid any damage to sensitive networking and computing equipment. The commissioning is performed by an IT engineer with additional switches (wired and/or wireless), IP routers, and computing devices. Direct Internet connectivity for all installed/commissioned devices in the building is only available at this point. The BLMS that monitors and controls the various building automation components is only connected to the field devices at this stage. The different network islands (for lighting and HVAC) are also joined together without any further involvement of domain specialists, such as lighting or HVAC commissioners.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="operational" title="Operational">
<t>The building automation system is now finally ready, and the operational access is transferred to the
facility management company of the building (U4.2). The facility manager is responsible for monitoring and ensuring that the building automation system meets the needs of the building occupants. If changes are needed, the facility-management company hires an external installation and commissioning company to perform the changes.</t>

<t>Different parts of the building are rented out to different companies for
office space. The tenants are provided access to use the automated HVAC, lighting, and physical access control systems deployed.
The safety of the occupants is also managed using automated systems, such as a
fire-alarm system, which is triggered by several smoke detectors that are spread out across the building.</t>

<t>Company A's staff moves into the newly furnished office space.  Most lighting is
controlled by presence sensors that control the lighting of a specific group of
lights based on the authorization rules in the BLMS.  Additionally, employees
are allowed to manually override the lighting brightness and color in their
offices by using the switches or handheld controllers.  Such changes are allowed
only if the authorization rules exist in the BLMS.  For example, lighting in the
corridors may not be manually adjustable. </t>

<t>At the end of the day, lighting is dimmed or switched off if no occupancy
is detected, even if manually overridden during the day.</t>

<t>On a later date, Company B also moves into the same building, and shares some of
the common spaces and associated building automation components with Company A (U4.2, U4.9).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="maintenance" title="Maintenance">

<t>Company A's staff is annoyed that the lighting switches off too often in their
rooms if they work silently in front of their computers.  Company A notifies
the facility manager of the building to increase the delay
before lights switch off. The facility manager can either 
configure the new values directly in the BLMS or, if additional changes are needed on the field devices, 
hire commissioning Company C to perform the needed changes (U4.4).</t>

<t>Company C gets the necessary authorization from the facility-management company to
interact with the BLMS.  The commissioner's tool gets the necessary
authorization from the BLMS to send a configuration change to all lighting devices
in Company A's offices to increase the delay before they switch off. </t>

<t>At some point, the facility-management company wants to update the firmware of lighting 
devices in order to eliminate software bugs.  Before accepting the new 
firmware, each device checks the authorization of the facility-management company to perform this update (U4.13).</t>

<t>A network-diagnostic tool of the BLMS detects that a luminaire in one of Company A's offices is no longer connected to the network. The BLMS
alerts the facility manager to replace the luminaire. The facility manager
replaces the old broken luminaire and informs the BLMS of the identity (e.g.,
the Media Access Control (MAC) address) of the newly added device. Then, the BLMS authorizes the new
device in the system and seamlessly transfers all the permissions of the previous broken device to the replacement device (U4.12).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="recommissioning" title="Recommissioning">

<t>A vacant area of the building has recently been leased to Company A.  Before 
moving into its new office, Company A wishes to replace the lighting with  
more energy efficient and  better light quality luminaries.  They hire an 
installation and commissioning Company C to redo the illumination.  Company C 
is instructed to integrate the new lighting devices, which may be from 
multiple manufacturers, into the existing lighting infrastructure of the 
building, which includes presence sensors, switches, controllers, etc. (U4.1). </t>

<t>Company C gets the necessary authorization from the facility-management company to 
interact with the existing BLMS
(U4.4). To prevent disturbance to other occupants of the building, Company C is
provided authorization to perform the commissioning only during non-office
hours and only to modify configuration on devices belonging to the domain of
Company A's space (U4.5).
Before removing existing devices, all security and configuration material that belongs to the domain
is deleted and the devices are set back to factory state (U4.3). This ensures that these 
devices may be reused at other installations or in other parts of the same building without 
affecting future operations. 
After installation (wiring) of the new lighting devices, the commissioner adds
the devices into Company A's lighting domain.</t>

<t>Once the devices are in the correct domain, the commissioner authorizes the
interaction rules between the new lighting devices and existing devices, like
presence sensors (U4.7).  For this, the commissioner creates the authorization
rules on the BLMS that define which lights form a group and which 
sensors/switches/controllers are allowed to control which groups (U4.8).  These
authorization rules may be context based, like time of the day (office or 
non-office hours) or location of the handheld lighting controller, etc. (U4.5). </t>

</section>
<section anchor="decommissioning" title="Decommissioning">

<t>Company A has noticed that the handheld controllers are often misplaced and
hard to find when needed.  So most of the time, staff use the existing wall
switches for manual control.  Company A decides it would be better to 
completely remove handheld controllers and asks Company C to decommission them
from the lighting system (U4.4).</t>

<t>Company C again gets the necessary authorization from the facility-management company to
interact with the BLMS.  The commissioner now deletes any rules that allowed
handheld controllers authorization to control the lighting (U4.3, U4.6). 
Additionally, the commissioner instructs the BLMS to push these new rules to 
prevent cached rules at the end devices from being used. Any cryptographic key material 
belonging to the site in the handheld controllers is also removed, and they are set to the factory state (U4.3). </t>

<section anchor="public-safety" title="Public Safety">

<t>As part of the building safety code, the fire department requires that the
building have sensors that sense the level of smoke, heat, etc., when a fire 
breaks out.  These sensors report metrics that are then used by a back-end 
server to map safe areas and unsafe areas within a building and possibly 
the structural integrity of the building before firefighters may enter it.<vspace />
Sensors may also be used to track where human/animal activity is within the 
building.  This will allow people stuck in the building to be guided to 
safer areas and allow the suggestion of possible actions that they may take (e.g., using a
client application on their phones or giving loudspeaker directions) in order to bring
them to safety.  In certain cases, other organizations such as the police, 
ambulance, and federal organizations are also involved and therefore the 
co-ordination of tasks between the various entities have to be carried out using
efficient messaging and authorization mechanisms.</t>

<t>James, who works for Company A, turns on the air conditioning in 
his office on a really hot day.  Lucy, who works for Company B, wants to make tea using an electric 
kettle.  After she turns it on, she goes outside to talk to a colleague until 
the water is boiling.  Unfortunately, her kettle has a malfunction that causes 
overheating and results in a smoldering fire of the kettle's plastic case.</t>

<t>Due to the smoke coming from the kettle, the fire alarm is triggered.
Alarm sirens throughout the building are switched on simultaneously
(using a group communication scheme) to alert the staff of both companies 
(U4.8).  Additionally, the ventilation system of the whole building is closed
off to prevent the smoke from spreading and to withdraw oxygen from
the fire.  The smoke cannot get into James' office, even though he turned
on his air conditioning, because the fire alarm overrides the manual
setting by sending commands (using group communication) to switch off all
the air conditioning (U4.10).</t>

<t>The fire department is notified of the fire automatically and arrives within
a short time.  They automatically get access to all parts of the building according
to an emergency authorization policy (U4.4, U4.5).  After inspecting the damage and 
extinguishing the smoldering fire, a firefighter resets the fire alarm because only the
fire department is authorized to do that (U4.4, U4.11).</t>

<section anchor="smart_metering" title="Smart Metering">

<t>Automated measuring of customer consumption is an established technology for
electricity, water, and gas providers.  Increasingly, these systems also 
feature networking capability to allow for remote management.  Such systems
are in use for commercial, industrial, and residential customers and require a
certain level of security, in order to avoid economic loss to the providers,
vulnerability of the distribution system, as well as disruption of services
for the customers.</t>

<t>The smart metering equipment for gas and water solutions is battery-driven and
communication should be used sparingly due to battery consumption.  Therefore,
these types of meters sleep most of the time, and only wake up every minute/hour
to check for incoming instructions.  Furthermore, they wake up a few times a day
(based on their configuration) to upload their measured metering data.</t>

<t>Different networking topologies exist for smart metering solutions.  Based on
environment, regulatory rules, and expected cost, one or a mixture of these
topologies may be deployed to collect the metering information.  Drive-by
metering is one of the most current solutions deployed for collection of gas
and water meters.</t>

<t>Various stakeholders have a claim on the metering data.  Utility companies need
the data for accounting, the metering equipment may be operated by a third-party service operator who needs to maintain it, and the equipment is 
installed in the premises of the consumers, measuring their consumption,
which entails privacy questions.</t>

<section anchor="drive-by-metering" title="Drive-By Metering">

<t>A service operator offers smart metering infrastructures and related services 
to various utility companies.  Among these is a water provider, who in turn 
supplies several residential complexes in a city.  The smart meters are
installed in the end customer's homes to measure water consumption and thus
generate billing data for the utility company. They can also be used to shut
off the water if the bills are not paid (U5.1, U5.3).  The meters do this by 
sending and receiving data to and from a base station (U5.2).  Several base 
stations are installed around the city to collect the metering data.  However, 
in the denser urban areas, the base stations would have to be installed very 
close to the meters.  This would require a high number of base stations
and expose this more expensive equipment to manipulation or sabotage.  The 
service operator has therefore chosen another approach, which is to drive 
around with a mobile base station and let the meters connect to that in 
regular intervals in order to gather metering data (U5.4, U5.6, U5.8).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="meshed-topology" title="Meshed Topology">

<t>In another deployment, the water meters are installed in a building that
already has power meters installed, the latter are mains powered, and are
therefore not subject to the same power saving restrictions.  The water meters
can therefore use the power meters as proxies, in order to achieve better
connectivity.  This requires the security measures on the water meters to work
through intermediaries (U5.9).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="advanced-metering-infrastructure" title="Advanced Metering Infrastructure">

<t>A utility company is updating its old utility distribution network with 
advanced meters and new communication systems, known as an Advanced Metering 
Infrastructure (AMI).  AMI refers to a system that measures, collects, and
analyzes usage, and interacts with metering devices such as electricity 
meters, gas meters, heat meters, and water meters, through various 
communication media either on request (on-demand) or on predefined 
schedules.  Based on this technology, new services make it possible for 
consumers to control their utility consumption (U5.2, U5.7) and reduce 
costs by supporting new tariff models from utility companies, and more accurate
and timely billing.  However, the end consumers do not want unauthorized persons
to gain access to this data.  Furthermore, the fine-grained measurement of 
consumption data may induce privacy concerns, since it may allow others to
create behavioral profiles (U5.5, U5.10).</t>

<t>The technical solution is based on levels of data aggregation between smart
meters located at the consumer premises and the Meter Data Management (MDM)
system located at the utility company (U5.9).  For reasons of efficiency and
cost, end-to-end connectivity is not always feasible, so metering data is
stored and aggregated in various intermediate devices before being forwarded
to the utility company, and in turn accessed by the MDM.  The intermediate
devices may be operated by a third-party service operator on behalf of the
utility company (U5.7).  One responsibility of the service operator is to
make sure that meter readings are performed and delivered in a regular,
timely manner.  An example of a Service Level Agreement between the service
operator and the utility company is, for example, at least 95% of the meters have
readings recorded during the last 72 hours.</t>

<section anchor="ICS" title="Industrial Control Systems">

<t>Industrial control systems (ICS) and especially supervisory control and data
acquisition systems (SCADA) use a multitude of sensors and actuators in order
to monitor and control industrial processes in the physical world.  Example
processes include manufacturing, power generation, and refining of raw 
materials.</t>

<t>Since the advent of the Stuxnet worm, it has become obvious to the general 
public how vulnerable these kind of systems are, especially when connected to
the Internet <xref target="Karnouskos11"/>.  The severity of these vulnerabilities
are exacerbated by the
fact that many ICS are used to control critical public infrastructure, such as
nuclear power, water treatment, or traffic control.  Nevertheless, the economical 
advantages of connecting such systems to the Internet can be significant if
appropriate security measures are put in place (U7.5).</t>

<section anchor="oil-platform-control" title="Oil Platform Control">

<t>An oil platform uses an industrial control system to monitor data and control
equipment.  The purpose of this system is to gather and process data from a 
large number of sensors and control actuators such as valves and switches to
steer the oil extraction process on the platform.  Raw data, alarms, reports, 
and other information are also available to the operators, who can intervene
with manual commands.  Many of the sensors are connected to the controlling
units by direct wire, but the operator is slowly replacing these units by 
wireless ones, since this makes maintenance easier (U7.4).</t>

<t>Some of the controlling units are connected to the Internet, to allow for 
remote administration, since it is expensive and inconvenient to fly in a 
technician to the platform (U7.3).</t>

<t>The main interest of the operator is to ensure the integrity of control 
messages and sensor readings (U7.1).  Access in some cases needs to be 
restricted, e.g., the operator wants wireless actuators only to accept commands
by authorized control units (U7.2).</t>

<t>The owner of the platform also wants to collect auditing information for 
liability reasons (U7.1).</t>

<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<t>As the use cases listed in this document demonstrate, constrained
devices are used in various environments.  These devices are small and
inexpensive and this makes it easy to integrate them into many 
aspects of everyday life.  With access to vast amounts of valuable data 
and possible control of important functions, these devices need to be protected 
from unauthorized access.  Protecting seemingly innocuous data and functions
will lessen the possible effects of aggregation; attackers collecting data
or functions from several sources can gain insights or a level of control not 
immediately obvious from each of these sources on its own.</t>

<t>Not only the data on the constrained devices themselves is threatened, 
the devices might also be abused as an intrusion point to infiltrate 
a network.  Once an attacker gains control over the device, it can be used to 
attack other devices as well.  Due to their limited capabilities, constrained 
devices appear as the weakest link in the network; hence, they pose an attractive 
target for attackers.</t>

<t>This section summarizes the security problems highlighted by the use cases 
above and provides guidelines for the design of protocols for
authentication and authorization in constrained RESTful environments.</t>

<section anchor="attacks" title="Attacks">

<t>This document lists security problems that users of constrained
devices want to solve.  Further analysis of attack scenarios is not in
scope of the document.  However, there are attacks that must be
considered by solution developers.</t>

<t>Because of the expected large number of devices and their
ubiquity, constrained devices increase the danger from Pervasive
Monitoring <xref target="RFC7258"/> attacks. Solution Designers should consider
this in the design of their security solution and provide for
protection against this type of attack. In particular, messages
containing sensitive data that are sent over unprotected channels
should be encrypted if possible.</t>

<t>Attacks aimed at altering data in transit (e.g., to perpetrate fraud) are a 
problem that is addressed in many web security protocols such as TLS or IPsec.
Developers need to consider these types of attacks, and make sure that the 
protection measures they implement are adapted to the constrained environment.</t>

<t>As some of the use cases indicate, constrained devices may be
installed in hostile environments where they are physically accessible
(see <xref target="smart_metering"/>).  Protection from physical attacks is not in
the scope of this document, but it should be kept in mind by developers of
authorization solutions.</t>

<t>Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks threaten the availability of services
a device provides and constrained devices are especially vulnerable to these
types of attacks because of their limitations.  Attackers can illicit a 
temporary or, if the battery is drained, permanent failure in a service simply
by repeatedly flooding the device with connection attempts; for some services
(see <xref target="eHealth"/>), availability is especially important.
Solution designers must be particularly careful to consider the following 
limitations in every part of the authorization solution:</t>

<t><list style='symbols'>
  <t>Battery usage</t>
  <t>Number of required message exchanges</t>
  <t>Size of data that is transmitted (e.g., authentication and access
control data)</t>
  <t>Size of code required to run the protocols</t>
  <t>Size of RAM memory and stack required to run the protocols</t>
  <t>Resources blocked by partially completed exchanges (e.g., while one party
is waiting for a transaction time to run out)</t>

<abstract><t>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained (e.g., low-power, lossy) networks.  The nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained networks such as IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) often have high packet error rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s.  The protocol is designed for machine- to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation.</t><t>CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and Internet media types.  CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP for integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity for constrained environments.</t></abstract>
