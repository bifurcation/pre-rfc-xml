This specification extends the Post Office Protocol
version 3 (POP3) to support un-encoded international characters in
user names, passwords, mail addresses, message headers, and
protocol-level textual error strings.
</t></abstract>

<middle>

<section title="Introduction">
<t>This document forms part of the Email Address Internationalization
(EAI) experiment described in the <xref target="RFC4952">EAI Framework
document</xref> (for background, please see the charter of the EAI
working group) and should be evaluated within the context of EAI.  As
part of the overall EAI work, email messages may be transmitted and
delivered containing un-encoded UTF-8 characters, and mail drops that
are accessed using <xref target="RFC1939">POP3</xref> might natively
store UTF-8.</t>

<t>This specification extends <xref target="RFC1939">POP3</xref>
using the
<xref target="RFC2449">POP3 extension mechanism</xref> to
permit un-encoded <xref target="RFC3629">UTF-8</xref> in headers, as
described in <xref target="RFC5335">"Internationalized Email
  Headers"</xref>.  It also adds a mechanism to support login names
and passwords outside the ASCII character set, and a mechanism to support UTF-8
protocol-level error strings in a language appropriate for the
user.</t>

<t>This document updates <xref target="RFC1939">POP3</xref>, and the
   fact that an Experimental specification updates a Standards Track
   specification means that people who participate in the experiment
   have to consider the Standard updated.  In an attempt to reduce
   confusion, this
   Experimental document does not contain an "Updates" header.  If and when a
   version of this document moves to the Standards Track, an "Updates:
   1939" header should be added.</t>


<t>Within this specification, the term "down-conversion" refers to the
  process of modifying a message
  containing <xref target="RFC5335">UTF8 headers</xref>


or body parts with 8bit content-transfer-encoding, as defined in <xref
target="RFC2045">MIME Section 2.8</xref>, into conforming
  7-bit <xref target="RFC5322">Internet Message Format</xref>
  with <xref target="RFC2047">message header extensions for non-ASCII
  text</xref> and other 7-bit encodings.  

Down-conversion is specified
  by <xref target="RFC5504">"Downgrading Mechanism for Email Address
  Internationalization"</xref>.</t>


<section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
this document are to be interpreted as described in 
<xref target="RFC2119">"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate
Requirement Levels"</xref>.</t>


<t>In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
server, respectively.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to multiple
lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for editorial
clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol exchange.</t>

<t>Note that examples always use 7-bit ASCII characters due to
  limitations of this document format; in particular, some examples
  for the "LANG" command may appear silly as a result.</t>
</section></section>

<?rfc needLines="8"?>
<section title="LANG Capability">
<t>Per <xref target="RFC2449">"POP3 Extension Mechanism"</xref>, this
  document adds a new capability response tag to indicate support for
  a new command: LANG.  The capability tag and new command are
  described below.</t>

<t><list style="hanging">

</t>
<t>POP3 allows most +OK and -ERR server responses to include
human-readable text that, in some cases, might be presented to the
user.  But that text is limited to ASCII by the <xref
target="RFC1939">POP3 specification</xref>.  The LANG capability and
command permit a POP3 client to negotiate which language the server
should use when sending human-readable text.</t>
    
<t>A server that advertises the LANG extension MUST use the language
"i-default" as described in <xref target="RFC2277"></xref> as its default
language until another supported language is negotiated by the client. 
A server MUST include "i-default" as one of its supported languages.</t>

<t>The LANG command requests that human-readable text included in all
subsequent +OK and -ERR responses be localized to a language matching
the language range argument (the "Basic Language Range" as described by
<xref target="RFC4647"></xref>).  If the command succeeds, the server returns a
+OK response followed by a single space, the exact language tag
selected, another space, and the rest of the line is human-readable text
in the appropriate language.  This and subsequent protocol-level
human-readable text is encoded in the UTF-8 charset.</t>

<t>If the command fails, the server returns an -ERR response and
subsequent human-readable response text continues to use the language
that was previously active (typically i-default).</t>

<t>The special "*" language range argument indicates a request
to use a language designated as preferred by the server administrator.  The preferred language MAY vary based on the currently active user.</t>

<t>If no argument is given and the POP3 server issues a positive
  response, then the response given is multi-line.  After the initial
  +OK, for each language tag the server supports, the POP3 server
  responds with a line for that language.  This line is called a
  "language listing".</t>

<t>In order to simplify parsing, all POP3 servers are required to use
  a certain format for language listings.  A language listing consists
  of the <xref target="RFC5646">language tag</xref> of the message, optionally
  followed by a single space and a human-readable description of the
  language in the language itself, using the UTF-8 charset.</t>

<section title="UTF8 Capability">
<t>Per <xref target="RFC2449">"POP3 Extension Mechanism"</xref>,
  this document adds a new capability response tag to indicate support
  for new server functionality, including a new command: UTF8.  The
  capability tag and new command and functionality are described
  below.</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
<t hangText="CAPA tag:"><vspace/>UTF8</t>
<t hangText="Arguments with CAPA tag:"><vspace/>USER</t>

<t hangText="Discussion:"></t>
</list>
</t>
<t>This capability adds the "UTF8" command to POP3.  The UTF8 command
switches the session from ASCII to UTF-8 mode.</t>

<section anchor="UTF8_Command" title="The UTF8 Command">
<t>The UTF8 command enables UTF-8 mode.  The UTF8 command has no parameters.</t>

<t>Maildrops can natively store UTF-8 or be limited to ASCII.  UTF-8
mode has no effect on messages in an ASCII-only maildrop.  Messages in
native UTF-8 maildrops can be ASCII or UTF-8
using <xref target="RFC5335">internationalized headers</xref> and/or
8bit content-transfer-encoding, as defined
in <xref target="RFC2045">MIME Section 2.8 </xref>.  In UTF-8 mode,
both UTF-8 and ASCII messages are sent to the client as-is (without
conversion).  When not in UTF-8 mode, UTF-8 messages in a native UTF-8
maildrop MUST be down-converted (downgraded) to comply with unextended
POP and Internet Mail Format.  POP servers (unlike SMTP and Submit
servers) are not required to use <xref target="RFC5504">"Downgrading
Mechanism for Email Address Internationalization"</xref>.</t>

<t>
Discussion: The main argument against a single required mechanism for
downgrading by a POP server is that the only clients that have any use
for a standardized downgraded message (because they wish to interpret
downgrade headers, for example) are ones that can support UTF-8 and,
hence, will issue the UTF8 command in the first place.  The counter
argument to this is that clients that do not support UTF-8 might be upgraded in the
future; it's desirable for an upgraded client to be capable of
interpreting prior downgraded messages in the local mail store, which
is most likely if the messages were downgraded using one standardized
procedure.</t>

<t>Therefore, while POP servers are not required to
  use <xref target="RFC5504">"Downgrading Mechanism for Email Address
    Internationalization"</xref>, there are advantages to them doing
  so.</t>

<t>Note that even in UTF-8 mode, MIME binary content-transfer-encoding
  is still not permitted.</t>

<t>The octet count (size) of a message reported in a response to
the LIST command SHOULD match the actual number of octets sent in a
RETR response (not counting byte-stuffing).  Sizes reported elsewhere,
  such as in STAT responses and non-standardized, free-form text in
  positive status indicators (following "+OK") need not be accurate,
  but it is preferable if they are.</t>

<t>Discussion: Mail stores are either ASCII or native UTF-8, and
  clients either issue the UTF8 command or not.  The message needs
  converting only when it is native UTF-8 and the client has not issued
  the UTF-8 command, in which case the server must down-convert it.
  The down-converted message may be larger.  The server may choose
  various strategies regarding down-conversion, which include when to
  down-convert, whether to cache or store the down-converted form of a
  message (and if so, for how long), and whether to calculate or
  retain the size of a down-converted message independently of the
  down-converted content.  If the server does not have immediate access
  to the accurate down-converted size, it may be faster to estimate
  rather than calculate it.  Servers are expected to normally follow
  the <xref target="RFC1939">RFC 1939</xref> text on using the "exact
  size" in a scan listing, but there may be situations with maildrops
  containing very large numbers of messages in which this might be a
  problem.  If the server does estimate, reporting a scan listing size
  smaller than what it turns out to be could be a problem for some
  clients.  In summary, it is better for servers to report accurate
  sizes, but if this is not possible, high guesses are better than small ones.  Some
  POP servers include the message size in the non-standardized text
  response following "+OK" (the 'text' production
  of <xref target="RFC2449">RFC 2449</xref>), in a RETR or TOP
  response (possibly because some examples
  in <xref target="RFC1939">POP3</xref> do so).  There has been at
  least one known case of a client relying on this to know when it had
  received all of the message rather than following
  the <xref target="RFC1939">POP3</xref> rule of looking for a line
  consisting of a termination octet (".") and a CRLF pair.  While any
  such client is non-compliant, if a server does include the size in
  such text, it is better if it is accurate.</t>


<t>Clients MUST NOT issue the <xref target="RFC2595">STLS
command</xref> after issuing UTF8; servers MAY (but are not required
to) enforce this by rejecting with an "-ERR" response an STLS command
issued subsequent to a successful UTF8 command.  (Because this is a
protocol error as opposed to a failure based on conditions,
an <xref target="RFC2449">extended response code</xref> is not
specified.)</t>

</section>


<section title="USER Argument to UTF8 Capability">
<t>If the USER argument is included with this capability, it indicates
that the server accepts UTF-8 user names and passwords.</t>

<t>Servers that include the USER argument in the UTF8 capability
  response SHOULD apply <xref target="RFC4013">SASLprep</xref> to the
  arguments of the USER and PASS commands.</t>

<t>A client or server that supports APOP and permits UTF-8 in user
names or passwords MUST apply <xref target="RFC4013">SASLprep</xref>
to the user name and password used to compute the APOP digest.</t>

<t>When applying SASLprep <xref target="RFC4013"/>, servers MUST reject UTF-8 user
  names or passwords that contain a Unicode character listed in
  Section 2.3 of SASLprep <xref target="RFC4013"/>.
  When applying SASLprep to the USER argument, the PASS argument,
  or the APOP username argument, a compliant server or client MUST
  treat them as a query string (i.e., unassigned Unicode codepoints are
  allowed). When applying SASLprep to the APOP password argument, a
  compliant server or client MUST treat them as a stored string (i.e.,
  unassigned Unicode codepoints are prohibited).</t>


<t>The client does not need to issue the UTF8 command prior to using UTF-8 in authentication.  However, clients MUST NOT use UTF-8 in USER, PASS, or APOP commands unless the USER argument is included in the UTF8 capability response.</t>
<t>The server MUST reject UTF-8 user names or passwords that fail to
  comply with the formal syntax
  in <xref target="RFC3629">UTF-8</xref>.</t>

<t>Use of UTF-8 in the AUTH command is governed by
  the <xref target="RFC5034">POP3 SASL</xref> mechanism.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Native UTF-8 Maildrops">
<t>When a POP3 server uses a native UTF-8 maildrop, it is the responsibility
of the server to comply with the <xref target="RFC1939">POP3 base
specification</xref> and <xref target="RFC5322">Internet Message
    Format</xref> when not in UTF-8 mode.  Mechanisms for 7-bit
downgrading to help comply with the standards are described in <xref
target="RFC5504">"Downgrading Mechanism for Email Address
    Internationalization"</xref>.</t>

</section>

<?rfc needLines="4"?>
<section title="IANA Considerations">
<t>This specification adds two new capabilities ("UTF8" and "LANG") to
the <xref target="RFC2449">POP3 capability registry</xref>.</t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>The security considerations of <xref target="RFC3629">UTF-8</xref>
and <xref target="RFC4013">SASLprep</xref> apply to this specification,
particularly with respect to use of UTF-8 in user names and passwords.</t>

<t>The "LANG *" command might reveal the existence and preferred
language of a user to an active attacker probing the system if the
active language changes in response to the USER, PASS, or APOP
commands prior to validating the user's credentials.  Servers MUST
implement a configuration to prevent this exposure.</t>

<t>It is possible for a man-in-the-middle attacker to insert a LANG
  command in the command stream, thus making protocol-level diagnostic
  responses unintelligible to the user.  A mechanism to
  integrity-protect the session, such
  as <xref target="RFC2595">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</xref> can
  be used to defeat such attacks.</t>

<t>Modifying server authentication code (in this case, to support
  UTF-8) needs to be done with care to avoid introducing
  vulnerabilities (for example, in string parsing).</t>

<t>The <xref target="UTF8_Command">UTF8 command description</xref> 
  contains a discussion on reporting inaccurate sizes.  An additional
  risk to doing so is that, if a client allocates buffers based on the
  reported size, it may overrun the buffer, crash, or have other
  problems if the message data is larger than reported.</t>

<section title="Design Rationale">
<t>This non-normative section discusses the reasons behind some of the
  design choices in the above specification.</t>

<t>Having servers perform up-conversion so that, at a minimum,
  RFC2047-encoded words are decoded
  into UTF-8 is tempting, since this
  is an area that clients often fail to correctly implement.  However,
  after much discussion, the EAI group felt that the benefits did not
  justify the burden.</t> 

<t>Due to interoperability problems with RFC 2047 and limited
  deployment of RFC 2231, it is hoped these 7-bit encoding mechanisms
  can be deprecated in the future when UTF-8 header support becomes
  prevalent. </t>

<t>USER is optional because the implementation burden
  of <xref target="RFC4013">SASLprep</xref> is not well understood, and
  mandating such support in all cases could negatively impact
  deployment.</t>

<t>While it is possible to provide useful examples for language
negotiation without support for non-ASCII characters, it is
difficult to provide useful examples for commands specifically
designed to use the UTF-8 charset un-encoded when the document
format is limited to ASCII.  As a result, there are no plans to
provide examples for that part of the specification as long as this
remains an experimental proposal.  However, implementers of this
specification are encouraged to provide examples to the document
authors for a future revision.</t> 

<t>While down-conversion of native UTF-8 messages is mandatory in the absence of the UTF8
command, servers are not required to use <xref
target="RFC5504">"Downgrading Mechanism for Email Address
    Internationalization"</xref> to do so.  As clients are
upgraded with UTF-8 support and the ability to intelligently handle
(e.g., display and reply to) UTF-8 messages that were downgraded in
transit, it is better if they are also able to handle messages in
the local mail store that were downgraded by the POP server.  This
is more likely if the POP server downgrades messages using the same
mechanism as an SMTP server.</t>
