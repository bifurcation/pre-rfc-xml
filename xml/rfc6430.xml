      This document defines a new Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) feedback report type value:
      "not-spam".
      It can be used to report an email message that was mistakenly marked as spam.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        In RFC 5965 <xref target='RFC5965' />, an Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) is defined 
        for reporting email abuse. Currently, two feedback report types are defined
        that are related to the spam problem and that can be used to report
        abusive or fraudulent email messages:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
          abuse: indicates unsolicited email or some other kind of email abuse.
          </t>
          <t>
          fraud: indicates some kind of fraud or phishing activity. 
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>    
        This specification defines a new feedback report type: "not-spam". It can be
        used to report a message that was mistakenly marked as spam.
      </t>
       
      <section title="Discussion">
        <t>
          In some cases, the email client receives an email message that was incorrectly
          tagged as spam, perhaps by the email system, or accidentally by the user.
          The email client accepts the end user's "not-spam"
          report instruction, retrieves information related to the
          message, and reports this email as not-spam to the email operator. 
          When the email operator receives the report, it can determine what action is
          appropriate for the particular message and user.
          (The requirement for a not-spam report type is from the Open Mobile
          Alliance (OMA) Spam Report Requirement Document <xref target='OMA-SpamRep-RD' />.)
        </t>
        <t>
          For example, in response to a "not-spam" report,
          the email system can remove the spam tag or otherwise reclassify the message,
          possibly preventing similar email for this user
          from being marked as spam in the future.
          The report can be used to adjust the training of an automated classifier.
          After processing the report,
          the email operator might send a notification to the email client about the
          processing result
          (for example, by moving the message from one mailbox to another, such as
          from "Junk" to "Inbox").
        </t>
        <t>
          In most cases, "not-spam" reports will probably not be taken on their own,
          but will be considered along with other information, analysis of the message, etc.
          Because different users have different needs and different views of what
          constitutes spam, reports from one user might or might not be applicable to
          others.
          And because users might sometimes press a "report not spam" button accidentally,
          immediate strong action, such as marking all similar messages as "good" based on
          a single report, is probably not the right approach.
          Recipients of "not-spam" reports need to consider what's right in their environments.
        </t>
        <t>
          There are anti-spam systems that use (non-standard) "not spam" feedback today.
          All of them take the reports and mix them with other spam reports and other data,
          using their own algorithms, to determine appropriate action.
          In no case do the existing systems use a "not spam" report as
          an immediate, automatic override.
        </t>
        <t>
          The feedback types "abuse" and "not-spam" can be taken as opposites.
          A mistaken "not-spam" report could be countermanded by a subsequent "abuse"
          report from the same user, and an operator could consider collected reports
          of "abuse" and "not-spam" in making future assessments.
        </t>

    <section title="Feedback Report Type: not-spam">
      <t>
        This document defines a new feedback report type, "not-spam", which
extends the Email Feedback Reports specification <xref target='RFC5965' />.

      </t>
      <t>
        In the first MIME part of the feedback report message, the end user or the email 
        client can add information to indicate why the message is not considered as spam -- for 
        example, because the originator or its domain is well known.       
      </t>
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="Example" title="Example">
      <t>
        In the example, Joe, a pharmaceuticals sales representative, has received
        a message about discount pharmaceuticals.  Because that is a frequent subject
        of spam email, the message has been marked as spam -- incorrectly, in this
        case.  Joe has reported it as "not-spam", and this is an example of the report,
        shortened (the "[...etc...]" part) for presentation here.
      </t>
      <t>
        Note that the message has been signed using DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) <xref
target="RFC6376"/> --
        a good security practice as suggested in Section 8.2 of RFC 5965 <xref target='RFC5965' />.

      <t>
        All of the security considerations from the Email Feedback Reports specification
        <xref target='RFC5965' /> are inherited here.
        In addition, the Email Feedback Reports Applicability Statement
        <xref target="MARF-AS"/>

        integrity-related aspects of accepting abuse feedback.
      </t>
      <t>
        In particular,
        not-spam reports will likely be used in an attack on a filtering
        system, reporting true spam as "not-spam".
        Even in absence of malice, some not-spam reports might be made in error,
        or will only apply to the user sending the report.
        Operators need to be careful in trusting such reports,
        beyond their applicability to the specific user in question.
