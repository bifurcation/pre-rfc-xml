    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>The RSVP-TE specification <xref target="RFC3209"/> and the GMPLS extensions 
      to RSVP&nbhy;TE <xref target="RFC3473"/> allow abstract nodes and resources to be 
      explicitly included in a path setup using the Explicit Route Object (ERO). </t>

      <t>Further, Exclude Route extensions <xref target="RFC4874"/> allow abstract 
      nodes or resources to be excluded from the whole path using the Exclude Route 
      Object (XRO). To exclude certain abstract nodes or resources between a specific 
      pair of abstract nodes present in an ERO, an Explicit Exclusion Route subobject 
      (EXRS) is used. </t>

      <t><xref target="RFC3209"/> already describes the notion of abstract nodes, where 
      an abstract node is a group of nodes whose internal topology is opaque to the 
      ingress node of the Label Switched Path (LSP). It further defines a subobject for 
      AS, but with a 2-byte AS number only. </t>
      
      <t>This document extends the notion of abstract nodes by adding new subobjects 
      for IGP areas and 4-byte AS numbers (as per <xref target="RFC6793"/>). These 
      subobjects can be included in ERO, XRO, or EXRS.</t>

      <t>In case of per-domain path computation <xref target="RFC5152"/>, where the 
      full path of an inter-domain TE LSP cannot be or is not determined at the ingress 
      node, the signaling message could use domain identifiers. The use of these new
      subobjects is illustrated in <xref target="SEC_E"/>.</t> 

      <t>Further, the domain 
      identifier could simply act as a delimiter to specify where the domain boundary 
      starts and ends.</t>
      
      <t>This is a companion document to Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) 
      extensions for the domain sequence <xref target="RFC7897"/>. </t>

      <section title="Scope" toc="default">
      <t>The procedures described in this document are experimental.  The	
 	   experiment is intended to enable research for the usage of domain	
 	   subobjects for inter-domain path setup.  For this purpose, this	
 	   document specifies new domain subobjects as well as how they	
 	   incorporate with existing subobjects.</t>	

	   <t>The experiment will end two years after the RFC is published.
	   At that point, the RFC authors will attempt to determine how
	   widely this has been implemented and deployed.</t>
 		
 	   <t>This document does not change the procedures for handling	
 	   subobjects in RSVP-TE.</t>	
 		
 	   <t>The new subobjects introduced by this document will not be understood
   by legacy implementations.  If a legacy implementation receives one
   of the subobjects that it does not understand in an RSVP-TE object,
    the legacy implementation will behave as described in <xref target="RFC3209"/> and 
 	   <xref target="RFC4874"/>. Therefore, it is assumed 
 	   that this experiment will be conducted only when all nodes 
 	   processing the new subobject form part of the experiment.</t>
 	   
 	   <t>When the result of implementation and deployment are available, this	
 	   document will be updated and refined, and then it will be moved from	
 	   Experimental to Standards Track.</t>
	      
 	   <t>It should be noted that there are other ways such as the use of a boundary 
 	   node to identify the domain (instead of a domain identifier); the mechanism 
 	   defined in this document is just another tool in the toolkit for the
 	   operator.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC4726"/> and <xref target="RFC4655"/> define domain 
        as a separate administrative or geographic environment within the network. 
        A domain could be further defined as a zone of routing or computational

        AS or an IGP area.</t> 
 
        <t>As per <xref target="RFC3209"/>, an abstract node is a group of nodes 
        whose internal topology is opaque to the ingress node of the LSP. Using 
        this concept of abstraction, an explicitly routed LSP can be specified 
        as a sequence of IP prefixes or a sequence of ASes. In this 
        document, we extend the notion to include the IGP area and 4-byte AS number.</t>

         used to specify exclusion of certain abstract nodes between a specific pair 
         of nodes. EXRS is a subobject carried inside the ERO. These subobjects can be

      <t>As stated in <xref target="RFC3209"/>, an explicit route is a particular path

	<t>For OSPF, the Area ID is a 32-bit number. 
	Subobjects for OSPF and IS-IS are of the

	<t>The new subobjects to support 4-byte AS numbers and the IGP (OSPF / IS-IS) 
	area could also be used in the XRO to specify exclusion of an 
	abstract node (a group of nodes whose internal topology is 
	opaque to the ingress node of the LSP). </t>

	<t>All the rules of processing are as per <xref target="RFC4874"/>. </t>

	<t>Note that if a node is called upon to 
	process a subobject defined in this 
	document that it does not recognize, it will behave as described 
	in <xref target="RFC4874"/> when
   an unrecognized XRO subobject is encountered, i.e., ignore it. 
   In this case, the desired exclusion will not be carried out.</t>

   <t>IGP area subobjects in the XRO are local to the current AS.  In case
   of multi-AS path computation that excludes an IGP area in a different
   AS, an IGP area subobject should be part of EXRS in the ERO to specify the AS in which the IGP area
   is to be excluded.  Further, policy may be applied to prune/ignore
   area subobjects in XRO at the AS boundary.</t>

	<t>As per <xref target="RFC4874"/>, the Explicit Exclusion Route
	is used to specify exclusion of certain abstract nodes between a 
	specific pair of nodes or 
	resources in the explicit route. EXRS is an ERO subobject that 
	contains one or more subobjects of its own, called EXRS subobjects.</t>

	<t>The EXRS subobject could carry any of the subobjects defined for 
	XRO; thus, the new subobjects to support 4-byte AS numbers and the IGP 
	(OSPF / IS&nbhy;IS) area can also be used in the EXRS.  The meanings of 
	the fields of the new XRO subobjects are unchanged when the 
	subobjects are included in an EXRS, except that the scope of the 
	exclusion is limited to the single hop between the previous 
	and subsequent elements in the ERO.</t>
