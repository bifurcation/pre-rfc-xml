    <abstract>
      <t>The IETF Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) working group has defined many encapsulations of various layer 1 and layer 2 service-specific PDUs and circuit data. In most of these encapsulations, use of the Pseudowire (PW) Control Word is required. However, there are several encapsulations for which the Control Word is optional, and this optionality has been seen in practice to possibly introduce interoperability concerns between multiple implementations of those encapsulations. This survey of the Pseudowire / Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) user
      community was conducted to determine implementation trends and the possibility of always mandating the Control Word.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Most Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) encapsulations mandate
      the use of the Control Word (CW) to carry information essential to the emulation,
to inhibit Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) behavior, and to discriminate Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) from Pseudowire (PW) packets. However, some
      encapsulations treat the Control Word as optional. As a result,
      implementations of the CW, for encapsulations for which it is optional,
      vary by equipment manufacturer, equipment model, and service provider
      network. Similarly, Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV)
      supports three Control Channel (CC) types and multiple Connectivity
      Verification (CV) types. This flexibility has led to reports of
      interoperability issues within deployed networks and associated documents
      to attempt to remedy the situation.</t>

      <t>The encapsulations and modes for which the Control Word is currently
      optional are: <list style="symbols">
          <t>Ethernet Tagged Mode <xref target="RFC4448"></xref></t>

          <t>Ethernet Raw Mode <xref target="RFC4448"></xref></t>

          <t>Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) <xref target="RFC4618"></xref></t>

          <t>High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) <xref target="RFC4618"></xref></t>

          <t>Frame Relay Port Mode <xref target="RFC4618"></xref></t>

          <t>ATM (N:1 Cell Mode) <xref target="RFC4717"></xref></t>
        </list>

      Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) <xref target="RFC5085"></xref> defines three Control Channel
      types for MPLS PWs: Type 1, using the PW Control Word; Type 2,
      using the Router Alert (RA) Label; and Type 3, using Time to Live (TTL) Expiration (e.g.,
      MPLS PW Label with TTL == 1). While Type 2 (RA Label) is indicated as
      being "the preferred mode of VCCV operation when the Control Word is not
      present", RFC 5085 does not indicate a mandatory Control Channel to
      ensure interoperable implementations. The closest it comes to mandating
      a control channel is the requirement to support Type 1 (Control Word)
      whenever the CW is present. As such, the three options yield
      seven implementation permutations (assuming you have to support at least
      one Control Channel type to provide VCCV). Due to these permutations,
      interoperability challenges have been identified by several VCCV
      users.</t>

      <t>In order to assess the best approach to address the observed
      interoperability issues, the PWE3 working group decided to solicit
      feedback from the PW and VCCV user community regarding implementation.
      This document presents the survey questionnaire and the information returned by those in the user community who participated.</t>

      <section title="PW/VCCV Survey Overview">
        <t>Per the direction of the PWE3 working group chairs, a survey was
        created to sample the nature of implementations of PWs, with
        specific emphasis on Control Word usage, and VCCV, with emphasis on
        Control Channel and Control Type usage. The survey consisted of a
        series of questions based on direction of the WG chairs and the survey
        opened to the public on November 4, 2010. The survey was conducted using the SurveyMonkey tool, http://www.surveymonkey.com. The survey ran from
        November 4, 2010 until February 25, 2011 and was repeatedly publicized on the PWE3 email list over that period.</t>
      <t>The editors took precautions to ensure the validity of the sample and the data. Specifically, only responses with recognizable non-vendor company-affiliated email addresses were accepted. Unrecognizable or personal email addresses would have been contacted to determine their validity, but none were received. Only one response was received from each responding company. If multiple responses from a company had been received, they would have been contacted to determine whether the responses were duplicative or additive. This, however, did not occur.</t>

      <section title="PW/VCCV Survey Form">
        <t>The PW/VCCV Implementation Survey requested the following
        information about user implementations (the lists of implementation choices were taken verbatim from the survey):

        <t>Approximately how many PWs of each type were
        deployed. Respondents could list a number, or for the sake of privacy,
        could just respond "In-Use" instead.</t>

        <t>For each encapsulation listed above, the respondent could
        indicate which Control Channel <xref target="RFC5085"></xref> was in use. (See Section 1 for a discussion of these Control Channels.) The options listed

      <t>For each encapsulation type for which the Control Word
   is optional, the respondents could indicate the encapsulation(s) for
   which Control Word was supported by the equipment vendor, and whether 
   the CW was also in use in the network. The encapsulations listed were:

<section title="Summary of Results">
<t>Prior to this survey, there was considerable speculation about whether the Control Word could always be mandated, with several proposals to do so. However, the survey showed that there was considerable deployment of PWs that did not use the CW. The publication of this survey serves as a reminder of the extent of PWs without the CW in use, and hence a reminder that the CW-less modes cannot be deprecated in the near future.</t>

      <section title="Open-Ended Question">
        <t>Space was provided for user feedback. The following instructions
        were given: "Please use this space to provide any feedback regarding
        PW and VCCV deployments, VCCV interoperability challenges, this survey
        or any network/vendor details you wish to share." Below are the
        responses, made anonymous. The responses are otherwise provided here verbatim.</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>BFD VCCV Control Channel is not indicated in the survey (may be
            required for PW redundancy purpose).</t>

            <t>Using CV is not required at the moment.</t>

            <t>COMPANY has deployed several MPLS network elements, from
            multiple vendors. COMPANY is seeking a uniform implementation of
            VCCV Control Channel (CC) capabilities across its various vendor
            platforms. This will provide COMPANY with significant advantages
            in reduced operational overheads when handling cross-domain
            faults. Having a uniform VCCV feature implementation in COMPANY
            multi-vendor network leads to: 
<?rfc text-list-symbols="oo"?>
<list style="symbols">
<t> Reduced operational cost and complexity 
</t>
<t> Reduced OSS development to coordinate incompatible VCCV implementations. 
</t>
<t> Increased end-end service availability when handing faults.
</t>
</list>

 In addition, currently
            some of COMPANY deployed VCCV traffic flows (on some vendor
            platforms) are not guaranteed to follow those of the
            customer&rsquo;s application traffic (a key operational
            requirement). As a result, the response from the circuit ping
            cannot faithfully reflect the status of the circuit. This leads to
            ambiguity regarding the operational status of our networks. An
            in-band method is highly preferred, with COMPANY having a clear
            preference for VCCV Circuit Ping using PWE Control Word. This
            preference is being pursued with each of COMPANY vendors.</t>

            <t>PW VCCV is very useful tool for finding faults in each PW
            channel. Without this we can not find fault on a PW channel. PW
            VCCV using BFD is another better option. Interoperability challenges
            are with Ethernet OAM mechanism.</t>

            <t>We are using L2PVPN AToM like-to-like models - ATMoMPLS -
            EoMPLS ATMoMPLS : This service offered for transporting ATM cells
            over IP/MPLS core with Edge ATM CE devices including BPX, Ericsson
            Media Gateway etc. This is purely a Port mode with cell-packing
            configuration on it to have best performance. QoS marking is done
            for getting LLQ treatment in the core for these MPLS encapsulated
            ATM packets. EoMPLS: This service offered for transporting 2G/3G
            traffic from network such as Node-B to RNC's over IP/MPLS backbone
            core network. QoS marking is done for getting guaranteed bandwidth
            treatment in the core for these MPLS encapsulated ATM packets. In
            addition to basic L2VPN service configuration, these traffic are
            routed via MPLS TE tunnels with dedicated path and bandwidth
            defined to avoid bandwidth related congestion.</t>

            <t>EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER does not provide options to configure
            VCCV control-channel and its sub options for LDP based L2Circuits.
            How can we achieve end-to-end management and fault detection of PW
            without VCCV in such cases?</t>

            <t>I'm very interested in this work as we continue to experience
            interop challenges particularly with newer vendors to the space
            who are only implementing VCCV via control word. Vendors who have
            tailed their MPLS OAM set specifically to the cell backhaul space
            and mandatory CW have been known to fall into this space. That's
            all I've got.</t>

        <t>I'm very interested in this work as we continue to experience
        interop challenges particularly with newer vendors to the space who
        are only implementing VCCV via control word. Vendors who have tailed
        their MPLS OAM set specifically to the cell backhaul space and
        mandatory CW have been known to fall into this space. That's all I've
        got.</t>

        ATMoMPLS : This service offered for transporting ATM cells over
        IP/MPLS core with Edge ATM CE devices including BPX, Ericsson Media
        Gateway etc. This is purely a Port mode with cell-packing
        configuration on it to have best performance. QoS marking is done for
        getting LLQ treatment in the core for these MPLS encapsulated ATM
        packets. EoMPLS: This service offered for transporting 2G/3G traffic
        from network such as Node-B to RNC's over IP/MPLS backbone core
        network. QoS marking is done for getting guaranteed bandwidth
        treatment in the core for these MPLS encapsulated ATM packets. In
        addition to basic L2VPN service configuration, these traffic are
        routed via MPLS TE tunnels with dedicated path and bandwidth defined
        to avoid bandwidth related congestion.</t>

        Without this we can not find fault on a PW channel. PW VCCV using BFD

        <t>COMPANY has deployed several MPLS network elements, from multiple
        vendors. COMPANY is seeking a uniform implementation of VCCV Control
        Channel (CC) capabilities across its various vendor platforms. This
        will provide COMPANY with significant advantages in reduced
        operational overheads when handling cross-domain faults. Having a
        uniform VCCV feature implementation in COMPANY multi-vendor network
        leads to: 
<list style="symbols">
<t> Reduced operational cost and complexity 
</t>
<t> Reduced OSS development to coordinate incompatible VCCV implementations. 
</t>
<t> Increased end-end service availability when handing faults.
</t>
</list>
 In addition, currently some of COMPANY deployed VCCV
        traffic flows (on some vendor platforms) are not guaranteed to follow
        those of the customer&rsquo;s application traffic (a key operational
        requirement). As a result, the response from the circuit ping cannot
        faithfully reflect the status of the circuit. This leads to ambiguity
        regarding the operational status of our networks. An in-band method is
        highly preferred, with COMPANY having a clear preference for VCCV
        Circuit Ping using PWE Control Word. This preference is being pursued
        with each of COMPANY vendors.</t>
