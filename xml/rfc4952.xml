<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
<t>
In order to use internationalized email addresses, we need to
internationalize both the domain part and the local part of email
addresses.
The domain part of email addresses is already internationalized
<xref target="RFC3490"/>, while the local part is not.  Without the
extensions specified in this document, the 
mailbox name is restricted to a subset of 7-bit ASCII
<xref target="RFC2821"/>.  Though MIME
<xref target="RFC2045"/> enables the transport of
non-ASCII data, it does not provide a mechanism for internationalized
email addresses.  In <xref target="RFC2047"> RFC 2047 </xref>, MIME
defines an encoding mechanism 
for some specific message header fields to accommodate non-ASCII data.
However, it does not permit the use of email addresses that include
non-ASCII characters.
Without the extensions defined here, or some equivalent set, the only
way to incorporate non-ASCII characters in any part of email
addresses is to use 
RFC 2047 coding to embed them in what
<xref target="RFC2822">RFC 2822</xref> calls the "display name"
(known as a  "name phrase" or by other terms elsewhere) of the relevant
headers. Information coded into the display name is invisible in the message
envelope and, for many purposes, is not part of the address at all.
</t>

<section title="Role of This Specification" anchor="role">
<t>
This document presents the overview and framework for an approach to
the next stage of email internationalization.  This new stage requires
not only internationalization of addresses and headers, but also
associated transport and delivery models.
<!-- <cref>Placeholder: The history of developments
and design ideas leading to this specification is described in
<xref target="I18Nemail-history"/>.</cref>  -->
</t>
<t>
This document provides the framework for a series of experimental
specifications that, together, provide the details for a way to
implement and support internationalized email.  The document itself
describes how the various elements of email 
internationalization fit together and how the relationships
among the
<!--provides a roadmap for navigating the -->
various documents are involved.

	 <section title="Problem Statement" anchor="problem">
<!-- <t><cref>REMOVE THIS: this section needs very significant reworking
for both content and presentation. Changed with -01c and again with
-02, but may still not be good enough</cref></t> -->

<!-- <t>Though domain names are already internationalized, the
internationalized forms are far from general adoption by ordinary -->
<t>Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) <xref target="RFC3490"/> permits internationalized domain names,
	but deployment has not yet reached most
	users.  One of the reasons for this is that we do not yet have fully
	internationalized naming schemes.  Domain names are just one of the
	various names and identifiers that are required to be
	internationalized.  In many contexts, until more of those identifiers
	are internationalized, internationalized domain names alone have
	little value. </t>

	<t>Email addresses are prime examples of why it is not good enough to
	just internationalize the domain name.  As most of us have learned
	from experience, users strongly prefer email addresses that resemble
	names or initials to those involving seemingly meaningless strings
	of letters or numbers.  Unless the entire email address can use
	familiar characters and formats, users will perceive email as being
	culturally unfriendly.  If the names and initials used in email
	addresses can be expressed in the native languages and writing
	systems of the users, the Internet will be perceived as more natural,
	especially by those whose native language is not written in a subset
	of a Roman-derived script.</t> 

<t>Internationalization of email addresses is not merely a matter of
changing the SMTP envelope; or of modifying the From, To, and Cc
headers; or of permitting upgraded Mail User Agents (MUAs) to decode a
special coding and respond by displaying local characters.  To be
perceived as usable, the addresses must be internationalized and
handled consistently in all of the contexts in which they occur.
This requirement has far-reaching implications: collections of patches
and workarounds are not adequate.  Even if they were adequate, a
workaround-based
approach may result in an assortment of implementations with different sets of
patches and workarounds having been applied with consequent user
confusion about what is actually usable and supported.
Instead, we need to build a fully
internationalized email environment, focusing on permitting efficient
communication among those who share a language or other community.
<!-- <cref> Placeholder:
   (see  <xref target="I18Nemail-constraints"/> for
   an extended discussion of this optimization).</cref> -->
That, in turn, implies changes to the mail header environment to
permit the full range of Unicode characters where that makes
sense, an
SMTP Extension to permit UTF-8 <xref target="RFC3629"/>
mail addressing and delivery of those
extended headers, and (finally) a requirement for support of the
8BITMIME SMTP extension <xref target="RFC1652"/> so that all of these
can be transported through the 
mail system without having to overcome the limitation that headers do
  not
have content-transfer-encodings.</t>

</section>

<section title="Terminology">
<t>This document assumes a reasonable understanding of the protocols and
	terminology of the core email standards as documented in
	<xref target="RFC2821"/> and <xref target="RFC2822"/>.
</t>

<t> Much of the description in this document depends on the
	abstractions of "Mail Transfer Agent" ("MTA") and "Mail User Agent"
	("MUA").  However, it is important to understand that those terms and
	the underlying concepts postdate the design of the Internet's email
	architecture and the application of the "protocols on the wire"
	principle to it. That email
	architecture, as it has evolved, and the "wire" principle have
	prevented any strong and standardized distinctions about how MTAs and
	MUAs interact on a given origin or destination host (or even whether
	they are separate).</t>

 <t><cref>WGLC, Framework 5, Issue #1391</cref>
	However, the term "final delivery MTA" is used in this document in
	a fashion equivalent to the term "delivery system" or "final
	delivery system" of RFC 2821.  This is the SMTP server that
	controls the format of the local parts of addresses and is permitted
	to inspect and interpret them.
	It receives messages from the network for
	delivery to mailboxes or for other local processing, including any
	forwarding or aliasing that changes envelope addresses, rather than
	relaying. From the perspective 
	of the network, any local delivery arrangements such as saving to
	a message store, handoff to specific message delivery programs
or agents, and mechanisms for retrieving messages are all "behind"
	the final delivery MTA and hence are not part of the SMTP transport or
	delivery process.</t>

   <t> In
		this document, an address is "all-ASCII", or just an "ASCII address",
		if every character in the 
		address is in the ASCII character repertoire <xref target="ASCII"/>;
		an address is "non-ASCII", or an "i18n-address", if any character
		is not in the ASCII 
		character repertoire.  Such addresses may be restricted
        in other ways, but those restrictions are not relevant to this
		definition.
		The term "all-ASCII" is also applied to other 
		protocol elements when the distinction is important, with "non-ASCII"
		or "internationalized" as its opposite.</t>

	<t>The umbrella term to describe the email address
	   internationalization specified by this document and its
	   companion documents is "UTF8SMTP".
	   For example, an address permitted by this specification is
	   referred to as a "UTF8SMTP (compliant) address".</t>

	<t>Please note that, according to the definitions given here, the
	   set of all "all-ASCII" addresses and the set of all "non-ASCII"
		addresses are mutually exclusive.  The set of all UTF8SMTP
		addresses is the union of these two sets.
	</t>

        <t>An "ASCII user" (i) exclusively uses email addresses that
		   contain ASCII 
        characters only, and (ii) cannot generate recipient addresses
		that contain non-ASCII characters.</t>

        <t>An "i18mail user" has one or more non-ASCII email
		   addresses. Such a user may have
        ASCII addresses too; if the user has more than one email
		account and a corresponding address, or more than one alias for
		the same address, he or she has
        some method to choose which address to use on outgoing email.
		Note that under this definition, it is not possible to tell
        from an ASCII address if the owner of that address is an
        i18mail user or not.  (A non-ASCII address implies a belief
        that the owner of that address is an i18mail user.)
		<!-- New text above, Ko/Gellens correspondence 20070117 -->
		There is no such thing as an "i18mail message"; the term
		applies only to users and their agents and capabilities.</t>

        <t>A "message" is sent from one user (sender) using a
		   particular email address to one or more
		   other recipient email addresses (often referred to just as
		   "users" or "recipient users").</t>

        <t>A "mailing list" is a mechanism whereby a message may be
		   distributed to multiple recipients by sending it to one
		   recipient address.  An agent (typically not a human being)
		   at that single address then causes the message to be
		   redistributed to the target recipients.  This agent sets the
		   envelope return address of the redistributed message to a
		   different address from that of the original single
		   recipient message.
		   Using a different envelope return address (reverse-path)
		   causes error (and other automatically generated) messages
		   to go to an error handling address.
		   <!-- <cref>REMOVE THIS??: The original language here ("...an user
			  can cause...") 
		   is wrong since it implies user intention. And "not under
		   control of" is also usually, but not always, true.   While
		   those conditions will often
		   be the case, a user generally won't know if a recipient
		   address is a list or not.  VRFY and EXPN were designed to
		   let would-be senders find out, but they are operationally
		   moribund.   We should be sure that, if 2821 has a
		   definition for "mailing list", it is consistent (and, if it
		   doesn't, get a consistent definition into 2821bis).
		   </cref> --> </t>

		<t><cref>WGLC, Framework 4.1, issue #1389</cref>
		   As specified in RFC 2821, a message that is undeliverable
		   for some reason is expected to result in notification to
		   the sender.  This can occur in either of two ways.
		   One, typically called "Rejection", occurs when an SMTP
		   server returns a reply code indicating a fatal error (a
		   "5yz" code) or persistently returns a temporary failure
		   error (a "4yz" code).
		   The other involves accepting
		   the message during SMTP processing and then generating a
		   message to the sender, typically known as a "Non-delivery
		   Notification" or "NDN".
		   Current practice often favors 
		   rejection over NDNs because of the reduced likelihood that
		   the generation of NDNs will be used as a spamming
		   technique.  The latter, NDN, case is unavoidable if
		   an intermediate MTA accepts a message that is then rejected
		   by the next-hop server.  <!-- The term "bounce" is used
		   informally below to cover both the rejection and NDN
		   cases.--> </t>

        <t>The pronouns "he" and "she" are used interchangeably to
		   indicate a human of indeterminate gender.</t>

    <t>The key words "MUST", "SHALL", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", and
		"MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
		<xref target="RFC2119">  RFC 2119</xref>. </t>

<t>Permits the selective use of UTF-8 strings in email headers (see

Some general principles affect the development decisions underlying this work.
<list style="numbers">
 <!-- <t>  Whatever encoding is used can and reasonably should be applied

   and be directly compatible with software used at the user

   <t>Email addresses enter subsystems (such as a user interface)
      that may perform charset conversions or other encoding changes.
      When the left hand side of the address includes characters
      outside the US-ASCII character repertoire, use of punycode
      on the right hand side is discouraged to promote consistent
      processing of characters throughout the address.</t>

</list>
  If the message cannot be forwarded because the next-hop system cannot
  accept the extension and insufficient information is available to
  reliably downgrade it, it MUST be rejected or a non-delivery message
  generated and sent.

<t>Conformance to the group of standards specified here for email
   transport and delivery requires implementation of the SMTP
   Extension specification, including recognition of the keywords
   associated with alternate addresses, and the UTF-8
   Header specification.  Support for downgrading is not required,
   but, if implemented, MUST be implemented as specified.
   Similarly, if the system implements IMAP or POP, it MUST conform
   to the i18n IMAP or POP specifications respectively.</t>
</section>


<section title="Transmission of Email Header Fields in UTF-8 Encoding"
   anchor="transmission">
<t> 
There are many places in MUAs or in a user presentation in which email
addresses or domain names appear. Examples include the conventional From,
To, or Cc header fields; Message-ID and In-Reply-To header fields that
normally contain domain names (but that may be a special case); and
in message bodies.  Each of these must be examined from an internationalization 
perspective.  The user will expect to see mailbox and domain names in
local characters, and to see them consistently. 
	<!-- commented out by (yw) : a situation in
	which an address is coded one way in a "From" field, another way in a
	signature line in the body of a the message, and, apparently
	arbitrarily, in one or the other of those forms in Return-Path,
	Received, or reference fields, will create confusion and frustration.
	JcK: I have replaced the commented-out material, and some of what
	followed, by new text.  I hope you like it better because the form in
	which you left the paragraph just could not be parsed.
	--> 
If non-obvious encodings, such as protocol-specific ASCII-Compatible
Encoding (ACE) variants, are
used, the user will inevitably, if only occasionally, see them
rather than "native" characters and will find that discomfiting or
astonishing. Similarly, if different codings are used for mail transport
and message bodies, the user is particularly likely to be surprised,
if only as a consequence of the long-established "things leak"
principle. 
 The only practical way
to avoid these sources of discomfort, in both the medium and the
longer term, is to have the 
encodings used in transport be as similar to the
encodings used in message headers and message bodies as possible.
<!-- [AUTH HTA email of 28 June, 2007 09:08 +0200] Other fixes
possible, but the changed version didn't work. -->
</t>

<t>When email local parts are internationalized, it seems clear that
   they should be accompanied by arrangements for the email headers to
   be in the
   fully internationalized form. That form should presumably use UTF-8
   rather than ASCII as the base character set for the contents of
   header fields (protocol elements such as the header field names
   themselves will remain entirely in ASCII).  For transition
   purposes and compatibility with legacy systems, this can done by
   extending the encoding models of 
   <xref target="RFC2045"/> and  <xref target="RFC2231"/>.
   However, our target should be fully internationalized headers, as
   discussed in <xref target="EAI-UTF8"/>.</t> 
</section>


<section title="Downgrading Mechanism for Backward Compatibility"
  anchor="compatibility" >

<t> As with any use of the SMTP extension mechanism, there is always
   the possibility of a client that requires the feature encountering a
	server that does not support the required feature.   In the case
	of email address and header 
	internationalization, the risk should be
	minimized by the fact that the selection of submission servers are
	presumably under the control of the sender's client and the selection of
	potential intermediate relays is under the control of the
	administration of the final delivery server.</t>

<t> For situations in which a client that needs to use UTF8SMTP
   encounters a server that does not support the extension UTF8SMTP,
   there are two possibilities: 
<list style="symbols">
<t>Reject the message or generate and send a non-delivery message, requiring
   the sender to resubmit it 
   with traditional-format addresses and headers.</t>
<t>Figure out a way to downgrade the envelope or message body in
	transit.  Especially when internationalized addresses are involved,
	downgrading will require that all-ASCII addresses be obtained
	from some source.  An optional extension parameter is
	provided as a way of transmitting an alternate address.
	Downgrade issues and a
	specification are discussed in <xref target="EAI-downgrade"/>.  </t>
</list> </t>
<t>(The client can also try an alternate next-hop host or requeue the
   message and try later, on the assumption that the lack of UTF8SMTP
   is a transient failure; since this ultimately resolves to success
   or failure, it doesn't change the discussion here.)
   <!-- New Paragraph above, Gellens, 20070117, IETF LC --> </t>
<t> The first of these two options, that of rejecting or returning the
   message to the sender MAY always be chosen.</t>
<t> If a UTF8SMTP capable client is sending a message that does not
   require the extended capabilities, it SHOULD send the message
   whether or not the server announces support for the extension.  In
   other words, both the addresses in the envelope and the entire set
   of headers of the message are entirely in ASCII (perhaps 
	including encoded words in the headers).   In that case, the client
	SHOULD send the message whether or not the server announces the
	capability specified here.</t>

<section title="Downgrading before and after SMTP Transactions"
anchor="EndpointDowngrade">
<t> In addition to the in-transit downgrades discussed above,
downgrading may also occur before or during the initial message submission
or after the delivery to the final delivery MTA.  Because these cases
have a different set of available information from in-transit cases,
the constraints and opportunities may be somewhat different too.
These two cases are discussed in the subsections below.</t>

<section title="Downgrading before or during Message Submission">
   <t>Perhaps obviously, the most convenient time to find an ASCII
   address corresponding to an internationalized address is at the
   originating MUA.  This can occur either before the message is 
	  sent or after the internationalized form of the message is
	  rejected.  It is also the most convenient time to convert a
	  message from the internationalized form into conventional ASCII
	  form or to generate a non-delivery message to the sender if
	  either is necessary.     At that point, the user has a full range of
	  choices available, including contacting the intended recipient
	  out of band for an alternate address, consulting appropriate
	  directories, arranging for translation of both addresses and
	  message content into a different language,
	  and so on.  While it is natural to think of message downgrading as
	  optimally being a fully-automated process, we should not
	  underestimate the capabilities of a user of at least moderate
	  intelligence who wishes to communicate with another such
	  user.</t>
   <t>In this context, one can easily imagine modifications to message
	  submission servers (as described in
	  <xref target="RFC4409"/>) so that they would
	  perform downgrading, or perhaps even upgrading, operations,
	  receiving messages with one or more of the internationalization
	  extensions discussed here and adapting the outgoing message, as
	  needed, to respond to the delivery or next-hop environment it
	  encounters. </t> <!-- [rfced] AQ: Please clarify the
	  sentence above. Is "operations" another item in the list? Is
	  it a "downgrading operation", etc.? -->
</section>

<section title="Downgrading or Other Processing After Final SMTP Delivery" 
		 anchor="PostDowngrade">
	<t>When an email message is received by a final delivery SMTP server, it is
		usually stored in some form.  Then it is retrieved either by software
		that reads the stored form directly or by client
		software via some email retrieval mechanisms such as POP or
		IMAP.</t> 
<t>The SMTP extension described in <xref target="smtpext"/> provides
   protection only in transport.  It does not prevent
	MUAs and email retrieval mechanisms that have not been upgraded to
	understand internationalized addresses and UTF-8 headers from accessing
	stored internationalized emails.</t>
<t>Since the final delivery SMTP server (or, to be more specific, its
	corresponding mail storage agent) cannot safely assume that agents
	accessing email storage will always be capable of handling the
	extensions proposed here, it MAY either downgrade internationalized
	emails or specially identify messages that utilize these extensions,
	or both.  If this is done, the final delivery SMTP
	server SHOULD include a mechanism to preserve or recover the original
	internationalized forms without information loss to support access by
	UTF8SMTP-aware agents.</t> 
<!-- <t>The method and format for downgrading at the final delivery SMTP
server is discussed in
<xref target="I18Nemail-pop"/> and <xref target="I18Nemail-imap"/>.
<cref>REMOVE THIS: It is still on discussion whether current 
description included in these documents is enough.</cref></t>  -->

<section title="Additional Issues">
<t>
This section identifies issues that are not covered as part of this
set of specifications, but that will need to be considered as part of
deployment of email address and header internationalization.</t>
<section title="Impact on URIs and IRIs">
<t><cref>WGLC issue 1396: title change</cref>
The mailto: schema defined in <xref target="RFC2368"/> and discussed
in the Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) specification
<xref target="RFC3987"/> may need to be modified when this work
is completed and standardized.</t>
</section>

<section title="Interaction with Delivery Notifications">
 <t>
The advent of UTF8SMTP will make necessary consideration
of the interaction with delivery notification mechanisms, including the
SMTP extension for requesting delivery notifications 
<xref target="RFC3461"/>, and the format of delivery notifications 
<xref target="RFC3464"/>.  These issues are discussed in a forthcoming
document that will update those RFCs as
needed <xref target="EAI-DSN"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Use of Email Addresses as Identifiers"
		anchor="AddrIdent">
   <t>There are a number of places in contemporary Internet usage in
	  which email addresses are used as identifiers for individuals,
	  including as identifiers to Web servers supporting some
	  electronic commerce sites.  These documents do not address those
	  uses, but it is reasonable to expect that some difficulties will
	  be encountered when internationalized addresses are first used
	  in those contexts, many of which cannot even handle the full range of
	  addresses permitted today. </t>
   </section>

   <section title="Encoded Words, Signed Messages, and Downgrading"
			anchor="BadSig">
	 <t>One particular characteristic of the email format is its
		persistency: MUAs are expected to handle messages that were
		originally sent decades ago and not just those delivered
		seconds ago.  As such, MUAs and mail filtering software, such
		as that specified in Sieve <xref target="RFC3028"/>,
		will need to continue to accept and decode header fields
		that use the "encoded word" mechanism
		<xref target="RFC2047"/> to accommodate non-ASCII characters in
		some header fields.  While extensions to both
		POP3 and IMAP have been proposed to enable automatic
		EAI-upgrade -- including RFC 2047 decoding -- of messages by
		the POP3 or IMAP server, there are message structures and MIME
		content-types for which that cannot be done or where the change
		would have unacceptable side effects.</t>
	 <t>For example, message parts that are cryptographically
		signed, using e.g., S/MIME <xref target="RFC3851"/>
		<cref>WGLC issue 1395</cref>
		or Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) <xref target="RFC3156"/>,
		cannot be upgraded from the RFC 2047 form to normal UTF-8 characters
		without breaking the signature.  Similarly,
		message parts that are encrypted may contain, when
		decrypted, header fields that 
		use the RFC 2047 encoding; such messages cannot be 'fully'
		upgraded without access to cryptographic keys.</t>
	 <t> Similar issues may arise if signed messages are downgraded in
		transit <xref target="EAI-downgrade"/> and then
		an attempt is made to upgrade them to the original form and then 
		verify the signatures.   Even the very subtle changes that may result from
		algorithms to downgrade and then upgrade again may be sufficient
		to invalidate the signatures if they impact either the primary or
		MIME bodypart headers.  When signatures are present, downgrading
		must be performed with extreme care if at all. </t>
 </section>

 <section title="Other Uses of Local Parts">
	<t><cref>WGLC, "Framework 7": This section tentatively added to keep
	   track of the relevant text.   There may not be consensus for it
	   in this form (or at all).</cref>
			Local parts are sometimes used to construct domain labels,
		e.g.,  the local part "user" in the address
		user@domain.example could be converted into a vanity host
		user.domain.example with its Web space at
		&lt;http://user.domain.example&gt; and the catchall addresses
		any.thing.goes@user.domain.example.</t>

		<t> Such schemes are obviously limited by, among
		   other things, the SMTP rules for domain names, and will
		   not work without further restrictions for 
		other local parts such as the &lt;utf8-local-part&gt; specified in
		<xref target="EAI-UTF8"/>.
		Whether this issue is relevant to these specifications is
		an open question.  It may be simply another case of
		the considerable flexibility accorded to delivery
		MTAs in determining the mailbox names they will
		accept and how they are interpreted.</t>
	 </section>

	 <section title="Non-Standard Encapsulation Formats">
		<t><cref>WGLC, "Framework 3": This section tentatively added
		   to keep track of the relevant text.   There may not be
		   consensus for it in this form (or at all).</cref>
		   Some applications use formats similar to the
		   application/mbox format defined
		   in <xref target="RFC4155"/> instead of the
		   message/digest
		   <xref target="RFC2046">RFC 2046, Section 5.1.5</xref>
		   form to transfer multiple
		   messages as single units.  Insofar as such applications
		   assume that all stored messages use the
		   message/rfc822
		   <xref target="RFC2046">RFC 2046, Section 5.2.1</xref> format with
		   US-ASCII headers, they are not ready for the extensions
		   specified in this series of documents and special measures
		   may be needed to properly detect and process them.</t>
		</section>
		
</section>


<section title="Experimental Targets">
   <t>In addition to the simple question of whether the model outlined
	  here can be made to work in a satisfactory way for upgraded
	  systems and provide adequate protection for un-upgraded ones, we
	  expect that actually working with the systems will provide
	  answers to two additional questions: what restrictions such as
	  character lists or normalization should be
	  placed, if any, on the characters that are permitted to be used
	  in address local-parts and how useful, in practice, will
	  downgrading turn out to be given whatever restrictions and
	  constraints that must be placed upon it.</t>
   </section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">
	<t> This overview description and framework document does not
	contemplate any IANA registrations or 
	other actions.  Some of the documents in the group have their own IANA
	considerations sections and requirements.</t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
<t> Any expansion of permitted characters and encoding forms in email
	addresses raises some risks.  There have been discussions on so called
	"IDN-spoofing" or "IDN homograph attacks".  These attacks allow an
	attacker (or "phisher") to 
	spoof the domain or URLs of businesses. The same kind of attack is also
	possible on the local part of internationalized email addresses. It
	should be noted that the proposed fix involving forcing all displayed
	elements into normalized lower-case works for domain names in URLs,
	but not email local parts since those are case sensitive.
</t>

<t>Since email addresses are often transcribed from business cards and
notes on paper, they are subject to problems arising from confusable
characters (see <xref target="RFC4690"/>).  These problems are somewhat
reduced if the domain 
associated with the mailbox is unambiguous and supports a relatively
small number of mailboxes whose names follow local system
  conventions. They are increased with very large mail systems in which users can
freely select their own addresses.</t>

<t>The internationalization of email addresses and headers must not leave
	the Internet less secure than it is without the required
	extensions.  The requirements and mechanisms documented in this set of
	specifications do not, in general, raise any new security issues.
	<cref>WGLC issue 1397: material below rewritten slightly. </cref>
	They do require a review of issues associated with confusable
	characters -- a topic that 
	is being explored thoroughly elsewhere
	(see, e.g., <xref target="RFC4690"/>)
	-- and, potentially, some issues with UTF-8 normalization,
	discussed in <xref target="RFC3629"/>, and other transformations.
	Normalization and other issues associated with transformations and
	standard forms are also part of the subject of ongoing work
	discussed in <xref target="Net-Unicode"/>,
	in <xref target="IDNAbis-BIDI"/> and elsewhere.
	Some issues specifically related to internationalized addresses
	and headers are discussed in more detail in
	the other documents in this set.  However, in particular, caution
	should be taken that any "downgrading" mechanism, or use of downgraded
	addresses, does not inappropriately assume authenticated bindings
	between the internationalized and ASCII addresses.</t>
  <t> The new UTF-8 header and message formats might also raise, or
	 aggravate, another known issue.  If the model creates new forms
	 of an 'invalid' or 
 	'malformed' message, then a new email attack is created:
 	in an effort to be robust, some or most agents will
 	accept such message and interpret them as if they were
 	well-formed.  If a filter interprets such a message
 	differently than the final MUA, then it may be possible
 	to create a message that appears acceptable under the
 	filter's interpretation but should be rejected under
 	the interpretation given to it by the final MUA.  Such attacks
 	already exist for existing messages and encoding layers, e.g.,
 	invalid MIME syntax, invalid HTML markup, and invalid coding of
	particular image types. </t>
 <t> Models for the "downgrading" of messages or addresses from
	UTF-8 form to some ASCII form, including those described in
	<xref target="EAI-downgrade"/>, pose another special problem and
	risk. Any system that transforms one address or set of mail
	header fields into another becomes a point at which spoofing
	attacks can occur and those who wish to spoof messages might be
	able to do so by imitating a message downgraded from one with a
	legitimate original address. </t>
<t>In addition, email addresses are used in many contexts other than
	sending mail, such as for identifiers under various circumstances
	(see <xref target="AddrIdent"/>).
	Each of those contexts will need to be evaluated, in turn, to
	determine whether the use of non-ASCII forms is appropriate and what
	particular issues they raise.</t>
<t>This work will clearly impact any systems or mechanisms that are
   dependent on digital signatures or similar integrity protection for
   mail headers (see also the discussion in <xref target="BadSig"/>).
   Many conventional uses of PGP and S/MIME are not 
   affected since they are used to sign body parts but not headers.
   On the other hand, the developing work on domain keys identified
   mail (DKIM <xref target="DKIM-Charter"/>) will eventually need
   to consider this work and vice versa: while this experiment does
   not propose to address or solve the issues raised by DKIM and other
   signed header mechanisms, the issues will have to be coordinated
   and resolved eventually if the two sets of protocols are to
   co-exist.  In addition, to the degree to which email
   addresses appear in PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) certificates, standards addressing such
   certificates will need to be upgraded to address these
   internationalized addresses.  Those upgrades will need to address
   questions of spoofing by look-alikes of the addresses themselves. </t>
