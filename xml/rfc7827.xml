<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) focuses on longer-term research issues
related to the Internet, while its sister organization, the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF), focuses on the shorter-term issues of engineering and
standards making.</t>

<t>The IRTF consists of a number of topical and long-term Research Groups (RGs).
These groups work on issues related to Internet protocols, applications,
architecture, and technology. RGs have the stable long-term membership that is
needed to promote the development of research collaboration and teamwork in
exploring research issues. Individual contributors participate in the IRTF,
rather than representatives of organizations.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC2014"/> details the procedures by which RGs operate. <xref target="RFC4440"/> discusses a
view from the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) on the IRTF and its relationship
to the IETF. The RFC Editor publishes documents from the IRTF and its RGs in the
IRTF Stream <xref target="RFC5743"/>.</t>

<t>The IRTF Chair is appointed by the IAB <xref target="RFC2014"/> for two-year terms and
manages the IRTF in consultation with the Internet Research Steering Group
(IRSG) and -- for some types of decisions -- the IAB. The IRSG membership includes
the IRTF Chair, the chairs of the various RGs, and other individuals ("members at
large") from the research community selected by the IRTF Chair.</t>

<t>There is no general appeals process defined for the IRTF. However, <xref target="RFC2014"/>
states that when an RG disagrees with the IRTF Chair's decision to
close the group, it can appeal to the IAB. Since the IRTF Chair serves at the
discretion of the IAB, it has been current practice to generalize this special
case in <xref target="RFC2014"/>: any grievances related to the IRTF Chair can be taken to
the IAB, and it takes appropriate measures.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="duties" title="Duties">

<t>This section discusses the various duties of the IRTF Chair and outlines the
skill set a candidate for the role should ideally have.</t>

<section anchor="strategic" title="Strategic">

<t>Arguably, the most important part of the duties of the IRTF Chair is strategic
and concerns shaping the purpose and scope of the IRTF, by making decisions
about which RGs to charter, which RGs to terminate, and which other activities
or efforts the IRTF should organize or affiliate itself with in order to further
its charter and increase the interaction and collaboration between network
research, engineering, operations, and standardization.</t>

<t>For some new RGs, the research and engineering community brings a proposal to
the IRTF Chair for discussion. However, it is common for the IRTF Chair to
identify a new area of research that is considered of importance to the
Internet, actively motivate people in the research and engineering community to
consider the formation of an RG, and help them navigate the process for doing
so.</t>

<t>In order to be able to fulfill this duty, it is important for the IRTF Chair to
be involved in both the academic research community as well as engineering or
operational communities. Without a demonstrated history of participation in
these often somewhat isolated communities, it will be very difficult to identify
areas of academic research that are suitable for being brought into the IRTF. A
good network of contacts in these communities will be very helpful in
identifying and motivating potential RG chairs and participants.</t>

<t>
 Involvement in the academic research community can be demonstrated
 in various ways -- a publication record, membership in conference 
 program and organizational committees, participation in publicly 
 funded collaborative research projects, etc.
</t>

<t>In addition to chartering new RGs, it is equally important for the IRTF to end
RGs that have run out of energy, are focused on issues no longer considered
important for the Internet, or are otherwise not operating well. Careful
communication and good people skills are essential in order to explain the
reasons for concluding an RG. The same skill set is also useful when explaining
to proponents of a new RG why their request is being denied.</t>

<t>The Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP) is a joint award of the Internet
Society (ISOC) and an example of a strategic initiative that since its inception
in 2011 has turned into more of an administrative duty. The IRTF Chair and an
ISOC representative pick and chair the ANRP selection committee, which
advertises the ANRP, encourages community nominations for the prizes, and
reviews nominations and selects prize winners. The IRTF Chair and the ISOC
representative also mentor the ANRP winners, who are often IETF newcomers, and
introduce them to other attendees who may have an interest in their work.</t>

<t>Chairmanship of the ANRP selection committee also relies on strong ties to the
academic research community, to identify suitable selection committee members
and to encourage nominations for suitable work that is published in a given
year. The selection committee operates similar to a program committee for an
academic conference (more specifically, it performs a function similar to the
selection of a best paper award). It is therefore useful if the IRTF Chair has
firsthand experience serving on program committees, and ideally, chairing them.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="administrative" title="Administrative">

<t>A good fraction of the duties of the IRTF Chair are administrative. Some of them
may be permanently or temporarily delegated to other IRSG members, but they
ultimately always remain the IRTF Chair's responsibility.</t>

<t>Some of those are related to publishing RFCs on the IRTF Stream, such as
ensuring sufficient review, so that documents published are of good quality;
scheduling the required Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) review
<xref target="RFC5742"/>; and following up with the IESG, IANA, and the RFC Editor during and
after the publication process.</t>

<t>Other administrative duties include reviewing and approving requests from the
RGs for time slots during IETF meetings or interim meetings elsewhere, ensuring
that meeting materials are submitted on schedule, maintaining the IRTF web site,
and -- in cooperation with the RG chairs -- ensuring that the IETF Datatracker
correctly reflects the status of the various IRTF-related documents.</t>

<t>The IRTF Chair appoints, replaces, and manages the RG chairs and the IRSG, and
follows the research work of the chartered and proposed RGs to a degree that is
sufficient to let them develop an understanding on whether they are generally
operating well.</t>

<t>The IRTF Chair also defines the operational procedures for the IRTF (in the
boundaries defined by <xref target="RFC2014"/>) and the IRSG. At the moment, these procedures
are captured as a set of <xref target="IRTF-WIKI">wiki pages</xref>, and it is the duty of the IRTF
Chair to refine and update these descriptions as procedures evolve. When process
questions on the IRSG or in an RG arise (e.g., on IPR, liaison statements,
consensus procedures, copyright, plagiarism, document publication, etc.), the
IRTF Chair is frequently consulted and needs to have sufficient familiarity in
the area to provide a definitive answer, or at least be able to identify an
external party for further consultation.</t>

<t>The IRSG tries to schedule a working dinner during each IETF meeting, and the
IRTF Chair is responsible for organizing the agenda and a suitable venue.</t>

<t>The IRTF Chair provides a status report on the IRTF to the IAB on a monthly
basis and also writes a regular column for the <xref target="IETF-JOURNAL">IETF Journal</xref> on
recent IRTF-related events.</t>

<t>During each IETF meeting, the IRTF Chair is responsible for organizing and
chairing the "IRTF Open Meeting", during which topics related to the IRTF are
presented and discussed. This includes a report by the IRTF Chair on the
status of the IRTF and its RGs (an abbreviated version of this report is also
usually given during the IETF technical plenary) as well as other presentations
from RGs, ANRP prize winners, individuals wishing to propose new RGS, or others.</t>

<t>These administrative duties are very similar to part of the duties of an Area
Director (AD) in the IETF and require the same set of organizational and
communication skills <xref target="IESG-EXP"/>. They also require a regular time commitment
throughout the year, the ability to attend most of the IETF meetings in person,
as well as some other related travel.</t>

<t>The IRTF Chair regularly interacts with the ADs and the IESG for document
reviews, planning IETF meeting agendas, and providing input on various IETF
efforts and topics. The IRTF Chair also regularly interacts with the IETF
Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) and the IETF Secretariat for meeting
planning, budgeting, and other organizational purposes. In addition, the IRTF
Chair also interacts with the Tools Team to provide input on how IETF tools can
best support the operation of the IRTF. Finally, the IRTF Chair is the owner of
the IRTF Stream of RFCs and is hence part of the group that reviews the RFC Editor's
performance and operation; also, the IRTF Chair engages with the Independent Submission Editor in
cases where submissions on the Independent Stream have relationships to the IRTF. A
good understanding of the purpose and procedures of these different bodies and a
good working relationship with the individuals serving on them are important.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="iab-membership" title="IAB Membership">

<t>The IRTF Chair serves as an "ex officio" member of the IAB <xref target="RFC2850"/> and is
expected to participate in IAB discussions and activities alongside the
NomCom-appointed IAB members.</t>

<t>This duty benefits from expertise that is similar to those of full IAB members
<xref target="IAB-EXP"/> and requires a similar time and travel commitment, for example, to
attend IAB retreats, relevant IAB workshops, as well as other meetings the IAB is
participating in or organizing. Per <xref target="IAB-EXP"/>, "it is desirable for IAB members
to have technical leadership experience, operational management backgrounds,
research or academic backgrounds, implementation experience, and experience in
other bodies involved in Internet governance."</t>

<t>The IRTF Chair frequently provides input to "birds of a feather" (BoF) sessions,
either as an ex officio IAB member (i.e., as a "BoF shepherd") or because it may
be unclear whether a proposed effort should be started as an IETF WG or an IRTF
RG.</t>
