      <section anchor="cid1" title="Introduction">
		<t>
			The appropriate configuration of IP addresses and subnet masks
for router network interfaces is generally a prerequisite to the
correct functioning of routing protocols. Consideration of various
items, including underlying link capabilities and connectivity,
geographical topology, available address blocks, assumed traffic
patterns etc., are used when determining the appropriate network topology and
the associated IP interface configuration.  
</t> 
<t>
When the capabilities and connectivity of the links that connect routers are
well-known and stable, logical network topology design and corresponding IP
interface configuration are straightforward. Absent any assumption about
link-level connectivity, however, there is no canonical method for determining
a given IP interface configuration.
</t> 
<t> Link-level connectivity is generally qualified as undetermined when it is
unplanned and/or time-varying in character. Ad hoc networks are typical
examples of networks with undetermined link-level connectivity. Routing
protocols for ad hoc networks are purposely designed to detect and maintain paths
across the network, even when faced with links with undetermined connectivity,
assuming that routers' interfaces are configured with IP addresses. This
document thus proposes a model for configuration of IP addresses and subnet
prefixes on router interfaces to links with undetermined connectivity
properties, to allow routing protocols and data packet forwarding to function.  
</t> 
<t> Note that routers may ultimately need additional IP prefixes for the
diverse applications that could run directly on the routers themselves, or for
assignment to attached hosts or networks. For IPv6, these addresses may be
global <xref target="RFC3587"/>, Unique-Local <xref target="RFC4193"/> or
Link-Local <xref target="RFC4291"/>. For IPv4, the addresses may be global
(i.e., public) or private <xref target="RFC1918"/>. In general, global scope is
desired over local scope, though it is understood that this may not always be
achievable via automatic configuration mechanisms. In this document however,
automatic configuration of the prefixes used for general applications is
considered as a problem that is separable from that of automatic configuration
of addresses and prefixes necessary for routing protocols to function. This
document thus focuses on the latter: the type of IP address and subnet mask
configuration necessary for routing protocols and data packet forwarding to
function.</t>

addresses and the IP subnet prefixes on a router's IP interfaces, which connect to

the connectivity between interfaces or the (persistent) reachability of some

<section title="IP Subnet Prefix Configuration" anchor="cid4">

<t>
	If the link to which an interface connects enables no assumptions of
connectivity to other interfaces, the only addresses that can be assumed "on
link", are the address(es) of that interface itself. Note that while link-local
addresses are assumed to be "on link", the utility of link-local addresses is
limited as described in <xref target="cid6"/>. 
</t>

<t>
	 Thus, subnet prefix configuration on such interfaces must not make any
promises in terms of direct (one hop) IP connectivity to IP addresses other
than that of the interface itself. This suggests the following principle:  
	 <list style="symbols">
               <t>no on-link subnet prefix should be configured on such an interface. </t>
               </list>
               
</t>

<t>
	 Note that if layer 2 communication is enabled between a pair of
interfaces, IP packet exchange is also enabled, even if IP subnet configuration
is absent or different on each of these interfaces.  
</t>

<t>
	Also note that if, on the contrary, assumptions can be made regarding
the connectivity between interfaces, or regarding the persistent reachability
of some addresses, these should be considered when configuring IP subnet
prefixes, and the corresponding interface(s) may in such case be configured
with an on-link subnet prefix. 
</t>

</section>

<section title="IP Address Configuration" anchor="cid5">

<t>
Routing protocols running on a router may exhibit different
requirements for uniqueness of interface addresses; some have no such
requirements, others have requirements ranging from local uniqueness
only, to uniqueness within, at least, the routing domain (as defined
in <xref target="RFC1136"/>). 
</t>
<t>
Routing protocols that do not require unique IP addresses within the
routing domain utilize a separate unique identifier within the routing
protocol itself; such identifiers could be based on factory assignment
or configuration.
</t>
<t>
Nevertheless, configuring an IP address that is unique within the routing
domain satisfies the less stringent uniqueness requirements,
while also enabling protocols that have the most
stringent requirements of uniqueness within the routing domain.
As a result, the following principle allows for IP autoconfiguration to
apply to the widest array of routing protocols:
	<list style="symbols">
               <t>
an IP address assigned to an interface that connects to a link
with undetermined connectivity properties should be unique, at
least within the routing domain.
</t> 
               </list>
</t>

</section>



<section title="Addressing Model" anchor="cid6">
<t>
Sections <xref target="cid4" format="counter" /> and <xref target="cid5"
format="counter" /> describe principles for IP
address and subnet prefix configuration on an interface of a router, when that
interface connects to a link with undetermined connectivity properties. The
following describes guidelines that follow from these principles, respectively
for IPv6 and IPv4. 
</t>

<t>
Note that the guidelines provided in this document slightly differ for IPv6 and
IPv4, as IPv6 offers possibilities that IPv4 does not (i.e., the possibility to
simply not configure any on-link subnet prefix on an IPv6 interface), which
provide a "cleaner" model. 
</t>

<section title="IPv6 Model" anchor="cid8">
<t>
For IPv6, the principles described in Sections <xref target="cid4" format="counter" /> and <xref
target="cid5" format="counter" /> suggest the following rules: 

<list style="symbols">
               <t> 
               		An IP address configured on this interface should be
unique, at least within the routing domain, and 
				</t>
               	<t>
               		No on-link subnet prefix is configured on this interface.
				</t>
            </list>
</t>

<t>
Note that while an IPv6 link-local address is assigned to each interface as per
<xref target="RFC4291"/>, in general link-local addresses are of limited
utility on links with undetermined connectivity, as connectivity to neighbors
may be constantly changing. The known limitations are: 

<list style="symbols">

<t>
In general, there is no mechanism to ensure that IPv6 link-local
addresses are unique across multiple links, though link-local
addresses using an IID that are of the modified EUI-64 form
should be globally unique.
</t>

<t>Routers cannot forward any packets with link-local source or destination
addresses to other links (as per <xref target="RFC4291"/>), while most of the
time, routers need to be able to forward packets to/from different links. 
</t>
</list>

Therefore, autoconfiguration solutions should be encouraged to primarily focus
on configuring IP addresses that are not IPv6 link-local. 

</t>

</section>

<section title="IPv4 Model" anchor="cid7">
<t>
For IPv4, the principles described in Sections <xref target="cid4" format="counter" /> and <xref
target="cid5" format="counter" /> suggest rules similar to those mentioned for IPv6 in <xref
target="cid8"/>, that are: 

<list style="symbols">
               <t>
               		An IP address configured on this interface should be
unique, at least within the routing domain, and 
				</t>
               	<t>
               		Any subnet prefix configured on this interface
               		should be 32 bits long.
				</t>
            </list>
</t>
<t>
Note that the use of IPv4 link-local addresses <xref target="RFC3927"/> in this
context should be discouraged for most applications, as the limitations
outlined in <xref target="cid8"/> for IPv6 link-local addresses also concern
IPv4 link-local addresses. These limitations are further exacerbated by the
smaller pool of IPv4 link-local addresses to choose from and thus increased
reliance on Duplicate Address Detection (DAD). 
</t>
</section>




</section>

      <section title="Security Considerations">
			    <t> This document focuses on the IP address
and subnet mask configuration necessary for routing protocols and data packet
forwarding to function. <xref target="RFC4593"/> describes generic threats to
routing protocols, whose applicability is not altered by the presence of
interfaces with undetermined connectivity properties. As such, the addressing
model described in this document does not introduce new security threats. 
    </t>
    <t>
        However, the possible lack of pre-established infrastructure or
authority, as enabled by the use of interfaces with undetermined connectivity
properties, may render some of the attacks described in <xref
target="RFC4593"/> easier to undertake. In particular, detection of malevolent
misconfiguration may be more difficult to detect and to locate.
