	This document provides a set of requirements for Advanced
	Multipath in MPLS networks.
      </t>
      <t>
	Advanced Multipath is a formalization of multipath techniques
	currently in use in IP and MPLS networks and a set of
	extensions to existing multipath techniques.
      </t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	There is often a need to provide large aggregates of bandwidth
	that are best provided using parallel links between routers or
	carrying traffic over multiple MPLS Label Switched Paths
	(LSPs).  In core networks, there is often no alternative since
	the aggregate capacities of core networks today far exceed the
	capacity of a single physical link or a single packet-processing
	element.
      </t>
      <t>
	The presence of parallel links, with each link potentially
	comprised of multiple layers, has resulted in additional
	requirements.  Certain services may benefit from being
	restricted to a subset of the component links or a specific
	component link, where component link characteristics, such as
	latency, differ.  Certain services require that an LSP be
	treated as atomic and avoid reordering.  Other services will
	continue to require only that reordering not occur within a
	flow as is current practice.
      </t>
      <t>
	Numerous forms of multipath exist today, including
	MPLS Link Bundling
	<xref target="RFC4201" />,
	Ethernet Link Aggregation
	<xref target="IEEE-802.1AX" />,
	and various forms of Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) such as for
	OSPF ECMP, IS-IS ECMP, and BGP ECMP.
	Refer to the appendices in
	<xref target="USE-CASES" />
	for a description of existing techniques and a set of
	references.
      </t>
      <t>
	The purpose of this document is to clearly enumerate a set of
	requirements related to the protocols and mechanisms that
	provide MPLS-based Advanced Multipath.  The intent is to first
	provide a set of functional requirements, in
	<xref target="FR" />, that are as independent as possible of
	protocol specifications.  A set of general protocol
	requirements are defined in <xref target="GR" />.  A set of
	network management requirements are defined in
	<xref target="MR" />.
      </t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>
	  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
          "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
          and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
          described in <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Any statement that requires the solution to support some
	  new functionality through use of <xref target="RFC2119" />
	  keywords should be interpreted as follows.  The
	  implementation either MUST or SHOULD support the new
	  functionality, depending on the use of either MUST or SHOULD
	  in the requirements statement.  The implementation SHOULD, in
	  most or all cases, allow any new functionality to be
	  individually enabled or disabled through configuration.  A
	  service provider or other deployment MAY enable or
	  disable any feature in their network, subject to
	  implementation limitations on sets of features that can be
	  disabled.

    <section anchor="def" title="Definitions">
      <t>
	<list hangIndent="4" style="hanging">
	  <t hangText="Multipath">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    The term "multipath" includes all techniques in which:
	    <list style="numbers">
	      <t>
		Traffic can take more than one path from one node to a
		destination.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Individual packets take one path only.  Packets are
		not subdivided and reassembled at the receiving end.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Packets are not resequenced at the receiving end.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		The paths may be:
		<list style="letters">
		  <t>
		    parallel links between two nodes,
		  </t>
		  <t>
		    specific paths across a network to a
		    destination node, or
		  </t>
		  <t>
		    links or paths to an intermediate node used
		    to reach a common destination.
		  </t>
		</list>
	      </t>
	    </list>
	    The paths need not have equal capacity.  The paths may or
	    may not have equal cost in a routing protocol.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Advanced Multipath">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    Advanced Multipath is a formalization of multipath
	    techniques that meets the requirements defined in this
	    document.  A key capability of Advanced Multipath is the
	    support of non-homogeneous component links.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Advanced Multipath Group (AMG)">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    An AMG is a collection of
	    component links where Advanced Multipath techniques are
	    applied.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Composite Link">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    The term "composite link" had been a registered trademark of
	    Avici Systems, but it was abandoned in 2007.  
	    The term "composite link" is now defined by the ITU-T in
	    <xref target="ITU-T.G.800" />.  The ITU-T definition
	    includes multipath as defined here, plus inverse
	    multiplexing, which is explicitly excluded from the
	    definition of multipath.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Inverse Multiplexing">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    Inverse multiplexing is another method of sending traffic
	    over multiple links.
	    Inverse multiplexing either transmits whole packets and
	    resequences the packets at the receiving end or subdivides
	    packets and reassembles the packets at the receiving end.
	    Inverse multiplexing requires that all packets be handled
	    by a common egress packet processing element and is,
	    therefore, not useful for very high-bandwidth applications.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Component Link">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    The ITU-T definition of composite link in
	    <xref target="ITU-T.G.800" /> and the IETF definition of
	    link bundling in <xref target="RFC4201" /> both refer to
	    an individual link in the composite link or link bundle as
	    a component link.  The term "component link" is applicable
	    to all forms of multipath.  The IEEE uses the term "member"
	    rather than "component link" in Ethernet Link Aggregation
	    <xref target="IEEE-802.1AX" />.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Client Layer">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    A client layer is the layer immediately above a server layer.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Server Layer">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    A server layer is the layer immediately below a client layer.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Higher Layers">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    Relative to a particular layer, a client layer and any
	    layer above that is considered a higher layer.  Upper
	    layer is synonymous with higher layer.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Lower Layers">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    Relative to a particular layer, a server layer and any
	    layer below that is considered a lower layer.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Client LSP">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    A client LSP is an LSP that has been set up over one or
	    more lower layers.  In the context of this discussion, one
	    type of client LSP is an LSP that has been set up over an
	    AMG.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Flow">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    A sequence of packets that should be transferred in order on
	    one component link of a multipath.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Flow Identification">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    The label stack and other information that uniquely
	    identifies a flow.  Other information in flow
	    identification may include an IP header, pseudowire (PW)
	    control word, Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) address, etc.  Note that a
	    client LSP may contain one or more flows, or a client LSP
	    may be equivalent to a flow.  Flow identification is used
	    to locally select a component link or a path through the
	    network toward the destination.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Load Balance">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    Load split, load balance, or load distribution refers to
	    subdividing traffic over a set of component links such
	    that load is fairly evenly distributed over the set of
	    component links and certain packet ordering requirements
	    are met.  Some existing techniques better achieve these
	    objectives than others.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Performance Objective">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    Numerical values for performance measures: principally
	    availability, latency, and delay variation.  Performance
	    objectives may be related to Service Level Agreements
	    (SLAs) as defined in <xref target="RFC2475" /> or may be strictly internal.
	    Performance objectives may span links from edge to edge or
	    from end to end.  Performance objectives may span one provider
	    or multiple providers.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>
      <t>
        A component link may be a point-to-point physical link (where
        a "physical link" includes one or more link layers, plus a
        physical layer) or a logical link that preserves ordering in
        the steady state.  A component link may have transient out-of-order
        events, but such events must not exceed the network's
        performance objectives.  For example, a component link may be
        comprised of any supportable combination of link layers over a
        physical layer or over logical sub-layers -- including those
        providing physical-layer emulation -- or over MPLS server-layer
        LSP.
      </t>
      <t>
	The ingress and egress of a multipath may be midpoint LSRs
	with respect to a given client LSP.  A midpoint LSR does not
	participate in the signaling of any clients of the client LSP.
	Therefore, in general, multipath endpoints cannot determine
	requirements of clients of a client LSP through participation
	in the signaling of the clients of the client LSP.
      </t>
      <t>
	This document makes no statement on whether Advanced Multipath
	is itself a layer or whether an instance of AMG is itself a
	layer.  This is to avoid engaging in long and pointless
	discussions about what constitutes a proper layer.
      </t>

      <t>
	The term "Advanced Multipath" is intended to be used within the
	context described in this document and related documents, for example,
	<xref target="USE-CASES" /> and <xref target="FRAMEWORK" />.
	Other Advanced Multipath
	techniques may arise in the future.  If the capabilities
	defined in this document become commonplace, they would no
	longer be considered "advanced".  Use of the term "advanced
	multipath" outside this document, if referring to the term as
	defined here, should indicate Advanced Multipath as defined by
	this document, citing the current document name.  If using
	another definition of "advanced multipath", documents may
	optionally clarify that they are not using the term "advanced
	multipath" as defined by this document if clarification is
	deemed helpful.

	      The transient period between some service disrupting

	      signaling protocols MUST occur within a time frame
	      specified by performance objective values.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      An AMG MAY be announced in conjunction with
	      detailed parameters about its component links, such as
	      bandwidth and latency. The AMG SHALL behave
	      as a single IGP adjacency.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL provide a means to summarize some
	      routing advertisements regarding the characteristics of
	      an AMG such that the updated protocol

	      time frame needed to meet or not significantly exceed
	      existing performance objectives for convergence on the
	      same network or convergence on a network with a similar
	      topology.

	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL ensure that restoration operations

	      The solution shall provide a mechanism to select a set

	      paths, while meeting all of the other requirements stated
	      above.  The solution SHOULD work in a manner similar to
	      existing multipath techniques, except as necessary to

	    </t>
	    <t>
	      If extensions to existing protocols are specified and/or

      <section anchor="layering"
	       title="Component Links Provided by Lower-Layer Networks">
	<t>
	  A component link may be supported by a lower-layer network.
	  For example, the lower layer may be a circuit-switched
	  network or another MPLS network (e.g., MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)). The lower-layer
	  network may change the latency (and/or other
	  performance parameters) seen by the client layer.
	  Currently, there is no protocol for the lower-layer network
	  to inform the higher-layer network of a change in a
	  performance parameter.  Communication of the latency
	  performance parameter is a very important requirement.
	  Communication of other performance parameters (e.g., delay
	  variation) is desirable.
          <list counter="fr" hangIndent="6" style="format FR#%d">

	      The solution SHALL specify a protocol means to allow a

	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The precision of latency reporting SHOULD be
	      configurable.  A reasonable default SHOULD be provided.

	</t>
	<t>
	  The intent is to measure the predominant latency in
	  uncongested service-provider networks, where geographic
	  delay dominates and is on the order of milliseconds or more.
	  The argument for including queuing delay is that it reflects
	  the delay experienced by applications.  The argument against
	  including queuing delay is that if used in routing decisions,
	  it can result in routing instability.  This trade-off is
	  discussed in detail in <xref
	  target="FRAMEWORK" />.

	  As one means to provide high availability, network operators

	  networks that have a certain degree of diversity at the

	      a particular component link within an AMG.  If this
	      option is not exercised, then a client LSP that is
	      carried over an AMG may be bound to any component link
	      or set of component links matching all other signaled
	      requirements, and different directions of a
	      bidirectional client LSP can be bound to different
	      component links.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution MUST support a means for the client layer
	      to indicate a requirement that for a specific co-routed
	      bidirectional client LSP, both directions of the
	      co-routed bidirectional client LSP MUST be bound to the
	      same set of nodes.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      A client LSP that is bound to a specific component link
	      SHOULD NOT exceed the capacity of a single component
	      link.  This is inherent in the assumption that a network
	      SHOULD NOT operate in a congested state if congestion is
	      avoidable.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>
	<t>
	  For some large bidirectional client LSPs, it may not be
	  necessary (or possible due to the client LSP capacity) to
	  bind the LSP to a common set of component links, but it may be
	  necessary or desirable to constrain the path taken by the
	  LSP to the same set of nodes in both directions.  Without an 
	  entirely new and highly dynamic protocol, it is not
	  feasible to constrain such a bidirectional client LSP from taking
	  multiple paths and coordinating load balance on each side in order
	  to keep both directions of flows within such an LSP on common
	  paths.

	       title="Multipath Load-Balancing Dynamics">
	<t>
	  Multipath load balancing attempts to keep traffic levels on
	  all component links below congestion levels if possible and
	  preferably well balanced.  Load balancing is minimally
	  disruptive (see the discussion below this section's list of
	  requirements).  The sensitivity to these minimal disruptions
	  of traffic flows within a specific client LSP needs to be
	  considered.
	</t>
	<t>
	  <list counter="fr" hangIndent="6" style="format FR#%d">
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL provide a means for the client layer
	      to indicate a requirement that a specific client LSP
	      MUST NOT be split across multiple component links.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL provide a means local to a node that
	      automatically distributes flows across the component
	      links in the AMG such that performance
	      objectives are met, as described in the prior requirements in
	      <xref target="multipath-diff" />.
	    </t>
            <t>
	      The solution SHALL measure traffic flows or groups of
	      traffic flows and dynamically select the component link
	      on which to place this traffic in order to balance the
	      load so that no component link in the AMG between a pair
	      of nodes is overloaded.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      When a traffic flow is moved from one component link to
	      another in the same AMG between a set of nodes, it MUST
	      be done so in a minimally disruptive manner.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Load balancing MAY be used during sustained low-traffic
	      periods to reduce the number of active component links
	      for the purpose of power reduction.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL provide a means for the client layer
	      to indicate a requirement that a specific client LSP
	      contains traffic whose frequency of component link
	      change due to load balancing needs to be bounded by a
	      specific value.  The solution MUST provide a means to
	      bound the frequency of a component link change due to load
	      balancing for subsets of traffic flow on AMGs.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL provide a means to distribute traffic
	      flows from a single client LSP across multiple component
	      links to handle at least the case where the traffic
	      carried in a client LSP exceeds that of any component
	      link in the AMG.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHOULD support the use case where an
	      AMG itself is a component link for a
	      higher order AMG.  For example, an
	      AMG comprised of MPLS-TP bidirectional
	      tunnels viewed as logical links could then be used as a
	      component link in yet another AMG that
	      connects MPLS routers.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      If the total demand offered by traffic flows exceeds the
	      capacity of the AMG, the solution SHOULD
	      define a means to cause some client LSPs to move to an
	      alternate set of paths that are not congested.  These
	      "preempted LSPs" may not be restored if there is no
	      uncongested path in the network.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>
	<t>
	  A minimally disruptive change implies that as little
	  disruption as is practical occurs.  Such a change can be
	  achieved with zero packet loss.  A delay discontinuity may
	  occur, which is considered to be a minimally disruptive
	  event for most services if this type of event is
	  sufficiently rare.  A delay discontinuity is an example of a
	  minimally disruptive behavior corresponding to current
	  techniques.
	</t>
	<t>
	  A delay discontinuity is an isolated event that may greatly
	  exceed the normal delay variation (jitter).  A delay
	  discontinuity has the following effect.  When a flow is
	  moved from a current link to a target link with lower
	  latency, reordering can occur.  When a flow is moved from a
	  current link to a target link with a higher latency, a time
	  gap can occur.  Some flows (e.g., timing distribution and PW
	  circuit emulation) are quite sensitive to these effects.  A
	  delay discontinuity can also cause a jitter buffer underrun
	  or overrun, affecting user experience in real-time voice
	  services (causing an audible click).  These sensitivities
	  may be specified in a performance objective.
	</t>
	<t>
	  As with any load-balancing change, a change initiated for
	  the purpose of power reduction may be minimally disruptive.
	  Typically, the disruption is limited to a change in delay
	  characteristics and the potential for a very brief period
	  with traffic reordering. When
	  configuring a network for power reduction, the network operator should weigh the
	  benefit of power reduction against the disadvantage of a
	  minimal disruption.

	    The solution SHOULD extend existing protocols wherever
	    possible, developing a new protocol only where doing so
	    adds a significant set of capabilities.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    A solution SHOULD extend LDP capabilities to meet
	    functional requirements.  This MUST be accomplished
	    without defining LDP Traffic Engineering (TE) methods as
	    decided in <xref target="RFC3468" />.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Coexistence of LDP- and RSVP-TE-signaled LSPs MUST be
	    supported on an AMG.
	    Function requirements SHOULD, where possible, be
	    accommodated in a manner that supports LDP-signaled LSP,
	    RSVP-signaled LSP, and LSP setup using management plane
	    mechanisms.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    When the nodes connected via an AMG are in the
	    same routing domain, the solution MAY define
	    extensions to the IGP.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    When the nodes are connected via an AMG are in
	    different MPLS network topologies, the solution SHALL NOT
	    rely on extensions to the IGP.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The solution SHOULD support AMG IGP
	    advertisement that results in convergence time better than
	    that of advertising the individual component links.  The
	    solution SHALL be designed so that it represents the range
	    of capabilities of the individual component links such
	    that functional requirements are met, and it also minimizes
	    the frequency of advertisement updates that may cause IGP
	    convergence to occur.

	    <vspace blankLines="1" /> Examples of advertisement-update-triggering events to be considered include: client LSP
	    establishment/release, changes in component-link
	    characteristics (e.g., latency and up/down state), and/or
	    bandwidth utilization.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    When a worst-case failure scenario occurs, the number of
	    RSVP&nbhy;TE client LSPs to be resignaled will cause a period of
	    unavailability as perceived by users. The resignaling time
	    of the solution MUST support protocol mechanisms meeting
	    existing provider performance objectives for the duration
	    of unavailability without significantly relaxing those
	    existing performance objectives for the same network or
	    for networks with similar topology. For example, the
	    processing load due to IGP readvertisement MUST NOT
	    increase significantly, and the resignaling time of the
	    solution MUST NOT increase significantly as compared with
	    current methods.
