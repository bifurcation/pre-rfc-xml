    <abstract>
      <t> This document describes the need for a new IANA Diameter Command Code to be used in a
        vendor-specific new application for invocation of Policy Processing (Policy Evaluation, or
        Evaluation and Enforcement). This application is needed as one of the implementations of the
        Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Policy Evaluation, Enforcement and Management (PEEM) enabler,
        namely for the PEM-1 interface used to send a request/response for Policy Processing.</t>
<!-- [rfced] Is PEM-1 an abbreviation?  Please expand.  Is it "Policy
Evaluation, Enforcement and Management Callable Interface"? -->

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t> This document summarizes the use of Diameter codes in a newly defined realization of a
        specification for invocation of policy processing (PEM-1). A
<!-- [rfced] Why is PEM-1 in parentheses here?  -->
new Command Code has been assigned by IANA. The document summarizes the uses of newly defined Diameter codes
        (a Command Code, an AVP, and a vendor-specific application id). When combined with the Diameter Base
        protocol, this application's specification satisfies the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Policy
        Evaluation, Enforcement, and Management (PEEM) requirements for sending a request for policy
        processing and receiving a response with the policy processing result. See <xref
          target="PEM-1-TS"/> for the normative use of Diameter. PEEM requirements are documented in
          <xref target="PEEM-RD"/> and PEEM Architecture is documented in <xref target="PEEM-AD"/>. </t>
      <t> The Diameter realization of this application assumes the use of the Diameter Base protocol, as
        per RFC 3588, and extends it only for a specific application using a vendor-id (PEN), a
        vendor-specific application ID, a new Command Code (314), and a new AVP defined in the
        vendor-specific namespace. Input to policy processing are being passed through a new AVP,
        and policy results are being passed through a combination of the same new AVP, and the
        Experimental-Result AVP. </t>

    <section title="Terminology">

      <t> The base Diameter specification (Section 1.4 of <xref target="RFC3588"/>) defines most of the
        terminology used in this document. Additionally, the terms and acronyms defined in <xref
          target="PEM-1-TS"/> are used in this document. <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Diameter Policy Processing Application">
      <t>A detailed description of the Diameter Policy Processing Application can be found in
        Section 5.4.1 of the Policy Evaluation, Enforcement and Management Callable Interface
        (PEM-1) Technical Specification <xref target="PEM-1-TS"/>. </t>
    </section>


    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document describes the Diameter Policy Processing Application. It builds on top of the
        Diameter Base protocol and the same security considerations described in RFC 3588 <xref
          target="RFC3588"/> are applicable to this document. No further extensions are required
        beyond the security mechanisms offered by RFC 3588. </t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t> This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) regarding
        registration of values related to the Diameter protocol, in accordance with BCP 26 <xref
          target="RFC2434"/>. </t>
      <t> This document defines values in the namespaces that have been created and defined in the
        Diameter Base <xref target="RFC3588"/>. The IANA Considerations section of that document
        details the assignment criteria. Values assigned in this document, or by future IANA action,
        must be coordinated within this shared namespace. </t>
      <section title="Command Codes">
        <t> This specification assigns the value 314 from the
Command Code namespace defined in <xref target="RFC3588"/>. See
Section 5.4.1.3.1 of <xref target="PEM-1-TS"/> for the assignment of
314. </t> 
<!-- [rfced] 

1. For the second sentence above, we recommend changing "314" to "the
command code".

2. The two sentences above seem to contradict each other.
If this document assigns the value, why refer to a separate document
for the assignment?

-->

<t>
   IANA has made the
   following assignment in the "Authentication, Authorization,     
   and Accounting (AAA) Parameters" registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/aaa-parameters, in the
   sub-registry "Command Codes".

      <section title="AVP Codes">
        <t> 
This specification uses the value 1 for the Policy-Data AVP, in the OMA
          Vendor-ID (PEN) AVP namespace. See Section 5.4.1.3.3 of <xref target="PEM-1-TS"/> for the
          assignment of the namespace in this specification. 
</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Application Identifier">
        <t> 
This specification uses the value 16777243 in the Application Identifier namespace as
registered in IANA for the Policy Processing Application. See Section 5.4.1.3 of <xref
target="PEM-1-TS"/> for more information.
