  <abstract>
    <t>This document discusses which multicast addresses should be used for
      documentation purposes and reserves multicast addresses for such
      use. Some multicast addresses are derived from
      AS numbers or unicast addresses. This document also explains how
      these can be used for documentation purposes.</t> 
  </abstract>

  <section title="Introduction">
    <t>It is often useful in documentation, IETF documents, etc.,
    to provide examples containing IP multicast addresses.
    For documentation where examples of general purpose multicast addresses
    are needed, one should use multicast addresses that will never be
    assigned or in actual use. There is a risk that addresses used in
    examples may accidentally be used. It is then important that the
    same addresses not be used by other multicast applications or
    services. It may also be beneficial to filter out such addresses
    from multicast signalling and to filter out multicast data sent to such addresses.

    </t><t>
    For unicast, there are both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
    reserved for this purpose;
    see <xref target="RFC5737"/> and <xref target="RFC3849"/>,
    respectively. This document reserves multicast addresses for this
    same purpose.
    </t>
    <t>There are also some multicast addresses that are derived from AS
    numbers or unicast addresses. For examples where such addresses are
    desired, one should derive them from the AS numbers and unicast
    addresses reserved for documentation purposes. This document also
    discusses the use of these.
</t>
  </section>
  <section title="IPv4 Multicast Documentation Addresses">
    <t>
    For Any-Source Multicast (ASM), the IPv4 multicast addresses allocated
    for documentation purposes
    are 233.252.0.0 - 233.252.0.255 (233.252.0.0/24).
    </t>
    <t>
    For Source-Specific Multicast (SSM), it is less important which multicast
    addresses are used, since
    a host/application joins a channel identified by both source and
    group. Any source addresses used in SSM examples should be unicast
    addresses reserved for documentation purposes. There are three
    unicast address ranges provided for documentation use in
    <xref target="RFC5737"/>. The ranges are 192.0.2.0/24,
    198.51.100.0/24 and 203.0.113.0/24.
    </t>
    <t>Sometimes one wants to give examples where a specific
    type of address is desired. For example, for text about multicast scoping,
    one might want the examples to use addresses that are to be used for
    administrative scoping. See below for guidance on how to construct
    specific types of example addresses.</t>

    <section title="Administratively Scoped IPv4 Multicast Addresses">
      <t>Administratively scoped IPv4 multicast addresses
      <xref target="RFC2365"/> are reserved for scoped multicast. They can
      be used within a site or an organization. Apart from a small set of
      scope-relative addresses, these addresses are not assigned. The high
      order /24 in every scope is reserved for relative assignments.
      A relative assignment is an integer offset from the highest address in
      the scope and represents an IPv4 address. For documentation
      purposes, the integer offset is 10. This provides one multicast address
      per scope.
      </t><t>
      For example in the Local Scope 239.255.0.0/16, the multicast address
      for documentation purposes is 239.255.255.245.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="GLOP Multicast Addresses">
      <t>GLOP <xref target="RFC3180"/> is a method for deriving IPv4 multicast
      group addresses from 16-bit AS numbers.  For examples where GLOP
      addresses are desired, the addresses should be
      derived from the AS numbers reserved for documentation use.
      </t>
      <t>The 16-bit AS numbers reserved for documentation use in
      <xref target="RFC5398"/> are 64496 - 64511. By use of
      <xref target="RFC3180"/>, we then get 16 /24 multicast prefixes
      for documentation use. The first
      one is 233.251.240.0/24, and the last one is 233.251.255.0/24.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Unicast Prefix-Based IPv4 Multicast Addresses">
    <t>IPv4 multicast addresses can be derived from IPv4 unicast prefixes,
    see <xref target="RFC6034"/>. For examples where this type of address
    is desired, the addresses should be derived from the unicast addresses
    reserved for documentation purposes, see <xref target="RFC5737"/>.
    </t>
    <t>There are three unicast address ranges provided for documentation use
    in <xref target="RFC5737"/>. The ranges are 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24,
    and 203.0.113.0/24. Using <xref target="RFC6034"/>, this leaves 
    the unicast prefix-based IPv4 multicast addresses 234.192.0.2,
    234.198.51.100, and 234.203.0.113.</t>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section title="IPv6 Multicast Documentation Addresses">
    <t>
      For Any-Source Multicast (ASM), the IPv6 multicast addresses allocated
      for documentation purposes are FF0X::DB8:0:0/96. This is a /96 prefix so that it
      can be used with group IDs, according to the allocation guidelines in
      <xref target="RFC3307"/>. Also note that for these addresses, the
      transient flag, or "T-flag" as defined in <xref target="RFC4291"/>, is
      zero. This is because they are permanently assigned. There can be no
      permanently assigned addresses for documentation purposes with the
      transient flag set to one, since the flag set to one means that they
      are not permanently assigned.
    </t>
    <t>
    For Source-Specific Multicast (SSM), it is less important which multicast
    addresses are used, since
    a host/application joins a channel identified by both source and
    group. Any source addresses used in SSM examples should be unicast
    addresses reserved for documentation purposes. The IPv6 unicast
    prefix reserved for documentation purposes is 2001:DB8::/32,
    see <xref target="RFC3849"/>.
    </t>
    <t>Sometimes one wants to give examples where a specific
    type of address is desired.  For example, for text about multicast scoping,
    one might want the examples to use addresses that are to be used for
    administrative scoping. See below for guidance on how to construct
    specific types of example addresses.</t>

    <section title="Unicast Prefix-Based IPv6 Multicast Addresses">
      <t>IPv6 multicast addresses can be derived from IPv6 unicast prefixes,
      see <xref target="RFC3306"/>. For examples where this type of address
      is desired, the addresses should be derived from the unicast addresses
      reserved for documentation purposes.
      </t> 
      <t>The IPv6 unicast prefix reserved for documentation purposes is
      2001:DB8::/32, see <xref target="RFC3849"/>.
      This allows a wide range of different IPv6 multicast addresses. Using
      just the base /32 prefix, one gets the IPv6 multicast prefixes
      FF3X:20:2001:DB8::/64 -- one for each available scope X.&nbsp; One can also
      produce longer prefixes from this. Just as an example, one can pick
       a /64 prefix 2001:DB8:DEAD:BEEF::/64, which gives the multicast
      prefixes FF3X:40:2001:DB8:DEAD:BEEF::/96 -- one for each available scope X.
      </t> 
    </section>
    <section title="Embedded-RP IPv6 Multicast Addresses">
      <t>There is a type of IPv6 multicast address called an "Embedded-RP"
      address, where the IPv6 address of a Rendezvous-Point (RP) is embedded
      inside the multicast address, see <xref target="RFC3956"/>.
      For examples where this type of address is desired, the addresses should
      be derived from the unicast addresses reserved for documentation purposes,
      see <xref target="RFC3849"/>.
      </t><t>
      For documentation purposes, the RP address can be any address from the
      range 2001:DB8::/32 that follows the constraints specified
      in <xref target="RFC3956"/>. One example address could be 2001:DB8::1.
      The Embedded-RP multicast prefixes might then be
      FF7X:120:2001:DB8::/96. Another example could be the RP address
      2001:DB8:BEEF:FEED::7, which gives the prefixes
      FF7X:740:2001:DB8:BEEF:FEED::/96. See also the examples in
      <xref target="RFC3956"/>.</t>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section title="Security Considerations">
    <t>
The use of specific multicast addresses for documentation purposes has no
negative impact on security.
</t>
  </section>
  <section title="IANA Considerations">
    <t>IANA has added a reference to this document for the
    IPv4 MCAST-TEST-NET allocation so that all the different documentation
    multicast assignments reference this document.</t>

    <t>IANA has assigned a scope-relative IPv4 address for
    documentation purposes.</t>

    <t>IANA has assigned "variable-scope" IPv6 multicast addresses
    for documentation purposes. This is a /96 prefix.</t>
