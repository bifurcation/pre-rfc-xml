    <abstract>
      <t>This document recommends against the use of the AS_SET and
      AS_CONFED_SET types 
      of the AS_PATH in BGPv4. This is done to simplify the design and
      implementation of BGP and to make the semantics of the
      originator of a route more clear. This will also simplify the design,
      implementation, and deployment of ongoing work in the Secure Inter-Domain
      Routing Working Group.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The AS_SET path segment type of the AS_PATH attribute
      (Sections 4.3 and 5.1.2 of <xref target="RFC4271"></xref>) is created
      by a router that is performing route aggregation and contains an
      unordered set of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that
      the update has traversed. The AS_CONFED_SET path type (<xref
      target="RFC5065"></xref>) of the AS_PATH attribute is created by a
      router that is performing route aggregation and contains an unordered
      set of Member AS Numbers in the local confederation that the update has
      traversed. It is very similar to AS_SETs but is used within a
      confederation.</t>

      <t>By performing aggregation, a router is, in essence, combining multiple
existing routes into a single new route.  This type of aggregation blurs the
semantics of what it means to originate a route. Said aggregation can therefore
cause operational issues, such as not being able to authenticate a route origin
for the aggregate prefix in new BGP security technologies (such as those that
take advantage of the "X.509 Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers"
<xref target="RFC3779"></xref>).  This in turn would result in reachability
problems for the aggregated prefix and its components (i.e., more specifics).
Said aggregation also creates traffic engineering issues, because the
precise path information for the component prefixes is not preserved.
</t>

      <t>From analysis of past Internet routing data, it is apparent that
      aggregation that involves AS_SETs is very seldom used in practice on the
      public network <xref target="Analysis"></xref> and, when it is used, it
      is usually used incorrectly -- reserved AS numbers (<xref
      target="RFC1930"></xref>) and/or only a single AS in the AS_SET are by
      far the most common case. Because the aggregation involving AS_SETs is
very rarely used, the reduction in table size provided by said aggregation is
extremely small, and any advantage thereof is outweighed by additional
complexity in BGP.  As noted above, said aggregation also poses impediments to
implementation of said new BGP security technologies.
</t>

      <t>In the past, AS_SET had been used in a few rare cases to allow route
aggregation where two or more providers could form the same prefix, using the
exact match of the other's prefix in some advertisement and  configuring the
aggregation differently elsewhere.  The key to configuring this correctly was
to form the aggregate at the border in the outbound BGP policy and omit
prefixes from the AS that the aggregate was being advertised to.  The AS_SET
therefore allowed this practice without the loss of BGP's AS_PATH loop
protection.  This use of AS_SET served a purpose that fell in line with the
original intended use. Without the use of AS_SET, aggregates must always
contain only less specific prefixes (not less than or equal to), and must
never aggregate an exact match.</t> 

    </section>

    <section title="Requirements Notation">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Recommendation to Network Operators">
      <t>It is RECOMMENDED that operators not generate any new announcements
containing AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs.  If they have already announced routes
with AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs in them, then they SHOULD withdraw those routes
and re-announce routes for the component prefixes (i.e., the additional
specifics of
the previously aggregated prefix) without AS_SETs in the updates.  This
involves undoing the aggregation that was previously performed (with AS_SETs),
and announcing more specifics (without AS_SETs).  Route aggregation that was
previously performed by proxy aggregation (i.e., without the use of AS_SETs) is
still possible under some conditions.  As with any change, the operator should
understand the full implications of the change.
</t>

      <t>It is worth noting that new technologies (such as those that take
advantage of the "X.509 Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers" <xref
target="RFC3779"></xref>) might not support routes with
AS_SETs/AS_CONFED_SETs in them, and may treat as infeasible routes
containing them.
Future BGP implementations may also do the same. It is expected that, even
before the deployment of these new or future technologies, operators may filter
routes with AS_SETs/AS_CONFED_SETs in them. Other than making that
observation, this document is not intended to make any recommendation for how
an operator should behave when receiving a route with AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET
in it. This document's focus is entirely on the sender side, as discussed in
the preceding paragraph.
</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document discourages the use of aggregation techniques that
      create AS_SETs. Future work may update the protocol to remove support
      for the AS_SET path segment type of the AS_PATH attribute. This
      future work will remove complexity and code that are not exercised
      very often, thereby decreasing the attack surface. This future work
      will also simplify the design and implementation of the Resource
      Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) and systems that will rely on it.</t>
