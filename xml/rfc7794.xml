    <abstract>
      <t>This document introduces new sub-TLVs to support advertisement of IPv4
      and IPv6 prefix attribute flags and the source router ID of the router
      that originated a prefix advertisement.</t>
    </abstract>

  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IS-IS is a link-state routing protocol defined in <xref target="ISO10589"/> and
      <xref target="RFC1195"/>. Extensions in support of advertising new forms of IPv4/IPv6
      prefix reachability are defined in <xref target="RFC5305"/>, <xref target="RFC5308"/>, and
      <xref target="RFC5120"/>.</t>

      <t>There are existing use cases in which knowing additional attributes
      of a prefix is useful.</t>

      <t>It is useful to know whether or not an advertised prefix is directly
      connected to the advertising router. In the case of Segment Routing as
      described in <xref target="SR"/>, knowing
      whether or not a prefix is directly connected determines what action
      should be taken as regards processing of labels associated with an
      incoming packet.</t>

      <t>It is useful to know what addresses can be used as addresses of the
      node in support of services (e.g., Remote Loop Free Alternate (RLFA)
      endpoint).</t>

      <t>Current formats of the Extended Reachability TLVs for both IPv4 and
      IPv6 are fixed and do not allow the introduction of additional flags
      without backwards compatibility issues. 
Therefore, this document defines a new sub-TLV
that supports the advertisement of attribute flags associated with prefix
advertisements.
      </t>

      <t>In cases where multiple node addresses are advertised by a given
      router, it is also useful to be able to associate all of these addresses
      with a single Router ID even when prefixes are advertised outside of the
      area in which they originated. Therefore, a new sub-TLV is introduced
      to advertise the Router ID of the originator of a prefix
      advertisement.</t>

    <section title="Requirements Language">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

    <section title="New Sub-TLVs for Extended Reachability TLVs">
      <t>The following new sub-TLVs are introduced:

      <list style="symbols">
          <t>Prefix Attribute Flags</t>

          <t>IPv4 Source Router ID</t>

          <t>IPv6 Source Router ID</t>
        </list> All sub-TLVs are applicable to TLVs 135, 235, 236, and
      237.</t>

      <section title="IPv4/IPv6 Extended Reachability Attribute Flags" anchor="sec_flags">
        <t>This sub-TLV supports the advertisement of additional flags
        associated with a given prefix advertisement. The behavior of each
        flag when a prefix advertisement is leaked from one level to another
        (upwards or downwards) is explicitly defined below.</t>

        <t>All flags are applicable to TLVs 135, 235, 236, and 237, unless
        otherwise stated.</t>

<t>
  Bits are defined/sent starting with Bit 0 defined below. Additional
  bit definitions that may be defined in the future SHOULD be assigned
  in ascending bit order so as to minimize the number of bits that
  will need to be transmitted.
</t>
<t> 

Undefined bits MUST be transmitted as 0 and MUST be ignored on
receipt.
</t>
<t>  Bits that are NOT transmitted MUST be treated as if they are
  set to 0 on receipt.

<t><list style="hanging">
<t hangText="X-Flag:"> External Prefix Flag (Bit 0)
<vspace/>
      Set if the prefix has been redistributed from another protocol.
      This includes the case where multiple virtual routers are
      supported and the source of the redistributed prefix is another
      IS-IS instance.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
      The flag MUST be preserved when leaked between levels.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>

      In TLVs 236 and 237, this flag SHOULD always be sent as 0 and 
      MUST be ignored on receipt. This is because there is an existing 
      X flag defined in the fixed format of these TLVs as specified in 
      <xref target="RFC5308"/> and <xref target="RFC5120"/>.
</t>

<t hangText="R-Flag:"> Re-advertisement Flag (Bit 1)

      (upwards or downwards).
</t>
<t hangText="N-flag:"> Node Flag (Bit 2)
<vspace/>
      Set when the prefix identifies the advertising router, i.e., the
      prefix is a host prefix advertising a globally reachable address
      typically associated with a loopback address.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
      The advertising router MAY choose to NOT set this flag even when 
      the above conditions are met.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
      If the flag is set and the prefix length is NOT a host prefix
      (/32 for IPV4, /128 for IPv6), then the flag MUST be ignored.
      The flag MUST be preserved when leaked between levels.

      <section title="IPv4/IPv6 Source Router ID" anchor="sec_source_router_id">
        <t>When a reachability advertisement is leaked from one level to
        another, the source of the original advertisement is unknown. In cases
        where the advertisement is an identifier for the advertising router
        (e.g., with the N-flag set in the Prefix Attribute Flags sub-TLV as
        described in <xref target="sec_flags"/>), it may be useful for other routers
        to know the source of the advertisement. The sub-TLVs defined below
        provide that information.</t>

        <t>Note that the Router ID advertised is always the Router ID of the
        IS-IS instance that originated the advertisement. This would be true
        even if the prefix had been learned from another protocol (i.e., with the X-flag set
        as defined in <xref target="sec_flags"/>).</t>

    Inclusion of this TLV is optional and MAY occur in TLVs 
    135, 235, 236, or 237. When included, the value MUST be
    identical to the value advertised in the Traffic Engineering 
    router ID (TLV 134) defined in <xref target="RFC5305"/>.
  </t>
  
  <t>
    If present the sub-TLV MUST be included when the prefix
    advertisement is leaked to another level.

<t>
  Inclusion of this TLV is optional and MAY occur in TLVs 
  135, 235, 236, or 237. When included, the value MUST be
  identical to the value advertised in the IPv6 TE Router ID 
  (TLV 140) defined in <xref target="RFC6119"/>.
</t>
<t>
  If present, the sub-TLV MUST be included when the prefix
  advertisement is leaked to another level.
</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Advertising Router IDs">
        <t><xref target="RFC5305"/> and <xref target="RFC6119"/> define the advertisement of router IDs for
        IPv4 and IPv6, respectively. Although both documents discuss the use of
        router ID in the context of Traffic Engineering (TE), the
        advertisement of router IDs is explicitly allowed for purposes other
        than TE. The use of router IDs to identify the source of a prefix
        advertisement as defined in <xref target="sec_source_router_id"/> is one such use case.


   Therefore, whenever an IPv4 or IPv6 Source Router ID sub-TLV (as
   defined in <xref target="sec_source_router_id"/>) is used, the originating router SHOULD also
   advertise the corresponding address-family-specific router ID TLV.

<abstract><t>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end paths within IGP topologies by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths, called "segments".  These segments are advertised by the link-state routing protocols (IS-IS and OSPF).
