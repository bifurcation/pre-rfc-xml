    <abstract>
      <t>This document captures the semantics of the "Footprint and
      Capabilities Advertisement" part of the Content Delivery Network
      Interconnection (CDNI) Request Routing interface, i.e., the
      desired meaning of "Footprint" and "Capabilities" in the CDNI
      context and what the "Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement
      interface (FCI)" offers within CDNI. The document also provides
      guidelines for the CDNI FCI protocol. It further
      defines a Base Advertisement Object, the necessary registries
      for capabilities and footprints, and guidelines on how these
      registries can be extended in the future.</t>
    </abstract>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction and Scope">
      <t>The CDNI working group
      is working on a set of protocols to enable the interconnection of
      multiple CDNs. These CDNI protocols can serve multiple purposes,
      as discussed in <xref target="RFC6770"/> -- for instance, to extend
      the reach of a given CDN to areas in the network that are not covered
      by that particular CDN.</t>

      <t>The goal of this document is to achieve a clear understanding about
      the semantics associated with the CDNI Request Routing Footprint &amp;
      Capabilities Advertisement interface (from now on referred to as
      the&nbsp;FCI) <xref target="RFC7336"/>, in particular the type of
      information a downstream CDN (dCDN) "advertises" regarding its
      footprint and capabilities. To narrow down undecided aspects of these
      semantics, this document tries to establish a common understanding of
      what the FCI needs to offer and accomplish in the context of CDNI. </t>

      <t>Deciding on specific protocols to use for the FCI is explicitly
      outside the scope of this document. However, we provide guidelines
      for such FCI protocols.</t>

      <t>We make the following general assumptions in this document:
       <list style="symbols">
          <t>The CDNs participating in the CDN interconnection have already
          performed a bootstrap process, i.e., they have connected to each
          other, either directly or indirectly, and can exchange information
          amongst each other.</t>

          <t>The upstream CDN (uCDN) receives footprint advertisements
          and/or capability advertisements from a set of dCDNs. Footprint
          advertisements and capability advertisements need not use the
          same underlying protocol.</t>

          <t>The uCDN receives the initial Request Routing message
          from the endpoint requesting the resource.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The CDNI problem statement <xref target="RFC6707"/> describes
      the Request Routing interface as "[enabling] a Request Routing
      function in an Upstream CDN to query a Request Routing function in a
      Downstream CDN to determine if the Downstream CDN is able (and willing)
      to accept the delegated Content Request."  In addition,
      <xref target="RFC6707"/> says "the CDNI Request Routing interface
      is also expected to enable a Downstream CDN to provide to the
      Upstream CDN (static or dynamic) information (e.g., resources,
      footprint, load) to facilitate selection of the Downstream CDN by
      the Upstream CDN Request Routing system when processing subsequent
      Content Requests from User Agents." It thus considers
      "resources" and "load" as capabilities to be advertised by the dCDN.</t>

      <t>The range of different footprint definitions and possible capabilities
      is very broad.  Attempting to define a comprehensive advertisement
      solution quickly becomes intractable.  The CDNI requirements document
      <xref target="RFC7337"/> lists the specific requirements for
      the CDNI FCI in order to disambiguate footprints and capabilities with
      respect to CDNI.  This document defines a common understanding of
      what the terms "footprint" and "capabilities" mean in the context of
      CDNI and details the semantics of the footprint advertisement mechanism
      and the capability advertisement mechanism.</t>

      <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
        <t>This document reuses the terminology defined in <xref
        target="RFC6707"/>.</t>

        <t>Additionally, the following terms are used throughout this document
        and are defined as follows:<list style="symbols">
            <t>Footprint: a description of a CDN's coverage area, i.e.,
            the area from which client requests may originate for content
            and to which the CDN is willing to deliver content.
            Note: There are many ways to describe a footprint -- for
            example, by address range (e.g., IPv4 CIDR or IPv6 CIDR
            (Classless Inter&nbhy;Domain Routing), network ID
            (e.g., Autonomous System Number (ASN)), nation boundaries
            (e.g., country code), or GPS coordinates.  This document
            does not define or endorse the quality or suitability of
            any particular footprint description method; rather, it
            only defines a method for transporting known footprint
            descriptions in Footprint and Capabilities Advertisement
            messages.</t>

            <t>Capability: a feature of a dCDN upon whose support a uCDN relies
            when making delegation decisions. Support for a given feature
            can change over time and can be restricted to a limited portion
            of a dCDN's footprint. Note: There are many possible dCDN
            features that could be of interest to a uCDN.  This document
            does not presume to define them all; rather, it describes a
            scheme for defining new capabilities and how to transport them
            in Footprint and Capabilities Advertisement messages.</t>

    <section anchor="sec.designdecisions"
             title="Design Decisions for Footprint and Capabilities">
      <t>A large part of the difficulty in discussing the FCI lies in
      understanding what exactly is meant when trying to define a footprint
      in terms of "coverage" or "reachability". While the operators of CDNs pick
      strategic locations to situate Surrogates, a Surrogate with a public IPv4
      address is reachable by any endpoint on the Internet, unless some policy
      enforcement precludes the use of the Surrogate.</t>

      <t>Some CDNs aspire to cover the entire world; we refer to these as
      global CDNs. The footprint advertised by such a CDN in the CDNI
      environment would, from a coverage or reachability perspective,
      presumably cover all prefixes. Potentially more interesting for CDNI use
      cases, however, are CDNs that claim a more limited coverage area but
      seek to interconnect with other CDNs in order to create a single CDN
      fabric that shares resources.</t>

      <t>Furthermore, not all capabilities need to be footprint-restricted.
      Depending upon the use case, the optimal semantics of "footprints with
      capability attributes" vs. "capabilities with footprint restrictions"
      are not clear.</t>

      <t>The key to understanding the semantics of footprint advertisements
      and capability advertisements lies in understanding why a dCDN would
      advertise a limited coverage area and how a uCDN would use such
      advertisements to decide among one of several dCDNs. The following
      section will discuss some of the trade-offs and design decisions that
      need to be made for the CDNI FCI. </t>

      <section anchor="sec.advertisinglimcoverage"
               title="Advertising Limited Coverage">
        <t>The basic use case that would motivate a dCDN to advertise
        limited coverage is that the CDN was built to cover only a particular
        portion of the Internet. For example, an ISP could purpose-build a CDN
        to serve only their own customers by situating Surrogates in close
        topological proximity to high concentrations of their subscribers. The
        ISP knows the prefixes it has allocated to end users and thus can
        easily construct a list of prefixes that its Surrogates were
        positioned to serve.</t>

        <t>When such a purpose-built CDN interconnects with other CDNs and
        advertises its footprint to a uCDN, however, the original intended
        coverage of the CDN might not represent its actual value to the
        interconnection of CDNs. Consider an ISP-A and ISP-B that both
        field their own CDNs, which they interconnect via CDNI. A given
        user E, who is a customer of ISP-B, might happen to be topologically
        closer to a Surrogate fielded by ISP-A, if E happens to live in a
        region where ISP-B has few customers and ISP-A has many. In this
        case, is it ISP-A's CDN that "covers" E? If ISP-B's CDN has a failure
        condition, is it up to the uCDN to understand that ISP-A's Surrogates
        are potentially available as backups, and if so, how does ISP-A
        advertise itself as a "standby" for E? What about the case where
        CDNs advertising to the same uCDN express overlapping coverage
        (for example, mixing global and limited CDNs)?</t>

        <t>The answers to these questions greatly depend on how much
        information the uCDN wants to use to select a dCDN. If a uCDN
        has three dCDNs to choose from that "cover" the IP address of
        user E, obviously the uCDN might be interested in knowing how optimal
        the coverage is from each of the dCDNs. Coverage need not be binary
        (i.e., either provided or not provided); dCDNs could advertise a
        coverage "score", for example, and provided that they all reported
        scores fairly on the same scale, uCDNs could use that information
        to make their topological optimality decision. Alternately, dCDNs
        could advertise the IP addresses of their Surrogates rather than
        prefix "coverage" and let the uCDN decide for itself (based on its
        own topological intelligence) which dCDN has better resources to serve
        a given user.</t>

        <t>In summary, the semantics of advertising a footprint depend on
        whether (1)&nbsp;such qualitative metrics for expressing a footprint
        (such as the coverage "score" mentioned above) are included as part of
        the CDNI FCI or (2)&nbsp;the focus is just on a "binary" footprint.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec.capanddyndata"
               title="Capabilities and Dynamic Data">
        <t>In cases where the apparent footprints of dCDNs overlap, uCDNs
        might also want to rely on other factors to evaluate the respective
        merits of dCDNs. These include facts related to the Surrogates
        themselves, the network where the Surrogate is deployed, the nature
        of the resource sought, and the administrative policies of the
        respective networks.</t>

        <t>In the absence of network-layer impediments to reaching Surrogates, the
        choice to limit coverage is, by necessity, an administrative policy. Much
        policy needs to be agreed upon before CDNs can interconnect,
        including questions of membership, compensation, volumes, and so on. A
        uCDN certainly will factor these sorts of considerations into its
        decision to select a dCDN, but there is probably little need for dCDNs
        to actually advertise them through an interface -- they will be settled
        out-of-band as a precondition for interconnection.</t>

        <t>Other facts about the dCDN would be expressed through the interface
        to the uCDN. Some capabilities of a dCDN are static, and some are
        highly dynamic. Expressing the total storage built into its Surrogates,
        for example, changes relatively rarely, whereas the amount of storage in
        use at any given moment is highly volatile. Network bandwidth
        similarly could be expressed either as total bandwidth available to a
        Surrogate or based on the current state of the network. A Surrogate
        can at one moment lack a particular resource in storage but have it the
        next.</t>

        <t>The semantics of the capabilities interface will depend on how much
        of the dCDN state needs to be pushed to the uCDN and, qualitatively,
        how often that information needs to be updated.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec.advertisingqueries"
               title="Advertisement versus Queries">
        <t>In a CDNI environment, each dCDN shares some of its state with
        the uCDN. The uCDN uses this information to build a unified picture of all
        of the dCDNs available to it. In architectures that share detailed
        capability information, the uCDN could perform the entire
        Request&nbsp;Routing operation down to selecting a particular Surrogate
        in the dCDN. However, when the uCDN needs to deal with many potential
        dCDNs, this approach does not scale, especially for dCDNs with
        thousands or tens of thousands of Surrogates; the volume of updates
        to the footprint and the capability information becomes onerous.</t>

        <t>Were the volume of FCI updates from dCDNs to exceed the volume of
        requests to the uCDN, it might make more sense for the uCDN to query
        dCDNs upon receiving requests (as is the case in the recursive
        redirection mode described in <xref target="RFC7336"/>), instead of
        receiving advertisements and tracking the state of dCDNs. The
        advantage of querying dCDNs would be that much of the dynamic data that
        dCDNs cannot share with the uCDN would now be factored into the uCDN's
        decision. dCDNs need not replicate any state to the uCDN -- uCDNs could
        effectively operate in a stateless mode.</t>

        <t>The semantics of both footprint advertisements and capability
        advertisements depend on the service model here: are there cases
        where a synchronous query/response model would work better for the
        uCDN decision than a state replication model?</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec.cheating"
               title="Avoiding or Handling &quot;Cheating&quot; dCDNs">
        <t>In a situation where more than one dCDN is willing to serve a given
        end user request, it might be attractive for a dCDN to "cheat" in the
        sense that the dCDN provides inaccurate information to the uCDN in
        order to convince the uCDN to select it over "competing" dCDNs.
        It could therefore be desirable to take away the incentive for dCDNs
        to cheat (in information advertised) as much as possible. One option
        is to make the information the dCDN advertises somehow verifiable
        for the uCDN. On the other hand, a "cheating" dCDN might be avoided or
        handled by the fact that there will be strong contractual agreements
        between a uCDN and a dCDN, so that a dCDN would risk severe penalties
        or legal consequences when caught cheating.</t>

        <t>Overall, the information a dCDN advertises (in the long run)
        needs to be somehow qualitatively verifiable by the uCDN, though
        possibly through non-real-time out-of-band audits. It is probably
        an overly strict requirement to mandate that such verification be
        possible "immediately", i.e., during the Request Routing process
        itself. If the uCDN can detect a cheating dCDN at a later stage, it
        might suffice for the uCDN to "de-incentivize" cheating because it
        would negatively affect the long-term business relationship with a
        particular dCDN.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec.decision"
             title="Focusing on Capabilities with Footprint Restrictions">
        <t>Given the design considerations listed in the previous section,
        it seems reasonable to assume that in most cases it is the uCDN
        that makes the decision to select a certain dCDN for Request Routing
        based on information the uCDN has received from this particular dCDN.
        It can be assumed that cheating dCDNs will be dealt with via means
        outside the scope of CDNI and that the information advertised between
        CDNs is accurate. In addition, excluding the use of qualitative
        information (e.g., Surrogate proximity, delivery latency, Surrogate
        load) to predict the quality of delivery would further simplify the
        use case, allowing it to better focus on the basic functionality of
        the FCI.</t>

        <t>Furthermore, understanding that in most cases contractual
        agreements will define the basic coverage used in delegation
        decisions, the primary focus of the FCI is on providing updates
        to the basic capabilities and coverage by the dCDNs. As such,
        the FCI has chosen the semantics of "capabilities with
        footprint restrictions".</t>
    </section>

        <section anchor="sec.capabilities" title="Footprint and Capabilities Extension">
          <t>Other optional "coverage/reachability" footprint types
          or "resource" footprint types may be defined by future
          specifications. To facilitate this, a clear process for
          specifying optional footprint types in an IANA registry is
          specified in the "CDNI Metadata Footprint Types" registry
          (defined in the CDNI Metadata interface document
          <xref target="RFC8006"/>).</t>

          <t>This document also registers CDNI Payload Types
          <xref target="RFC7736"/> for the initial capability types
          (see <xref target="sec.IANA"/>):</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Delivery Protocol (for delivering content to the end user)</t>
          
          <t>Acquisition Protocol (for acquiring content from the uCDN
          or origin server)</t>

          <t>Redirection Mode (e.g., DNS redirection vs. HTTP redirection as
          discussed in <xref target="RFC7336"/>)</t>

          <t>CDNI Logging (i.e., supported CDNI Logging fields)</t>

          <t>CDNI Metadata (i.e., supported GenericMetadata types)</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Each Payload Type is prefaced with "FCI.".  Updates to
        capability objects MUST indicate the version of the capability
        object in a newly registered Payload Type, e.g., by appending
        ".v2".  Each capability type MAY have a list of valid
        values. Future specifications that define a given capability
        MUST define any necessary registries (and the rules for adding
        new entries to the registry) for the values advertised for a
        given capability type.</t>

      <t>The "CDNI Logging record-types" registry
      <xref target="RFC7937" /> defines all known record-types,
      including "mandatory-to-implement" record-types.
      Advertising support for mandatory-to-implement record-types
      would be redundant.  CDNs SHOULD NOT
      advertise support for mandatory&nbhy;to&nbhy;implement record-types.</t>

      <t>The "CDNI Logging Field Names" registry
      <xref target="RFC7937" /> defines all known CDNI Logging fields.
      CDNI Logging fields may be reused by different record&nbhy;types
      and be mandatory-to-implement in some record-types, but they may be
      optional in other record-types.  CDNs MUST advertise support for optional
      CDNI Logging fields within the context of a specific
      record-type.  For a given record-type, CDNs SHOULD NOT
      advertise support for mandatory-to-implement CDNI Logging fields.
      The following CDNI Logging fields are defined as optional for the
      "cdni_http_request_v1" record-type <xref target="RFC7937" />:

          <t>s-sid</t>
        </list></t>

      <t><xref target="RFC8006" /> requires that CDNs be able to
      parse all the defined metadata objects but does not
      require dCDNs to support enforcement of non-structural
      GenericMetadata objects.  Advertising support for
      "mandatory-to-enforce" GenericMetadata types MUST be provided.
      Advertising support for non&nbhy;mandatory-to-enforce GenericMetadata
      types SHOULD be provided.  Advertisement of non-mandatory-to-enforce
      GenericMetadata MAY be necessary, e.g., to signal temporary
      outages and subsequent recovery.  It is expected that
      structural metadata will be supported at all times.</t>

            <t>The notion of optional footprint types and
            capability types implies that certain implementations might not
            support all kinds of footprints and capabilities. Therefore,
            any FCI solution protocol MUST define how the support for optional
            footprint types and capability types will be negotiated between
            a uCDN and a dCDN that use the particular FCI protocol. In
            particular, any FCI solution protocol MUST specify how to
            handle failure cases or non-supported footprint or capability
            types. </t>
          
            <t>In general, a uCDN MAY ignore capabilities or footprint types
            it does not understand; in this case, it only selects a
            suitable dCDN based on the types of capabilities and footprints
            it understands. Similarly, if a dCDN does not use an optional
            capability or footprint that is, however, supported by a uCDN,
            this causes no problem for FCI functionality because the uCDN
            decides on the remaining capabilities&wj;/footprint information
            that is being conveyed by the&nbsp;dCDN. </t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
<t>This specification describes the semantics for capabilities and footprint
advertisement objects across interconnected CDNs. It does not, however,
specify a concrete protocol for transporting those objects. Specific security
mechanisms can only be selected for concrete protocols that instantiate these
semantics. This document does, however, place some high-level security
constraints on such protocols.</t>

<t>All protocols that implement these capabilities and footprint
advertisement objects are REQUIRED to provide integrity and
authentication services. Without authentication and integrity,
an attacker could trivially deny service by forging a footprint
advertisement from a dCDN that claims the network has no footprint or
capability. This would prevent the uCDN from delegating any requests to the
dCDN. Since a preexisting relationship between all dCDNs and uCDNs is
assumed by CDNI, the exchange of any necessary credentials could be
conducted before the FCI is brought online. The authorization
decision to accept advertisements would also follow this preexisting
relationship and any contractual obligations that it stipulates.</t>

<t>All protocols that implement these capabilities and footprint
advertisement objects are REQUIRED to provide confidentiality
services. Some dCDNs are willing to share information about their
footprints or capabilities with a uCDN but not with other, competing
dCDNs. For example, if a dCDN incurs an outage that reduces footprint
coverage temporarily, that event could be information the dCDN would
want to share confidentially with the uCDN.</t>

<t>As specified in this document, the security requirements of the FCI could
be met by transport-layer security mechanisms coupled with domain certificates
as credentials (e.g., TLS transport for HTTP as per <xref target="RFC2818"/>
and <xref target="RFC7230"/>, with usage guidance from
<xref target="RFC7525"/>) between CDNs. There is no apparent need for
further object-level security in this framework, as the trust relationships
it defines are bilateral relationships between uCDNs and dCDNs rather than
transitive relationships.</t>

             title="Main Use Case to Consider">
      <t>Focusing on a main use case that contains a simple (yet somewhat
      challenging), realistic, and generally imaginable scenario can help
      narrow down the requirements for the CDNI FCI. To this end, the
      following (simplified) use case can help clarify the semantics of
      footprints and capabilities for CDNI. In particular, the intention of the
      use case is to clarify what information needs to be exchanged on the
      CDNI FCI, what types of information need to be supported in a mandatory
      fashion (and which types can be considered optional), and what types of
      information need to be updated with respect to a priori established CDNI
      contracts. </t>
      
     <t>Use case: A given uCDN has several dCDNs. It selects one dCDN for
     delivery protocol A and footprint 1 and another dCDN for delivery
     protocol B and footprint 1. The dCDN that serves delivery protocol B has
     a further, transitive (level-2) dCDN that serves delivery protocol B in
     a subset of footprint 1 where the first-level dCDN cannot serve delivery
     protocol B itself. What happens if capabilities change in the transitive
     level-2 dCDN that might affect how the uCDN selects a level-1 dCDN (e.g.,
     in case the level-2 dCDN cannot serve delivery protocol B anymore)? How
     will these changes be conveyed to the uCDN? In particular, what
     information does the uCDN need to be able to select a new first-level
     dCDN, for either all of footprint 1 or only the subset of footprint 1
     that the transitive level-2 dCDN served on behalf of the first-level
     dCDN?</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="sec.semantics_footprint"
             title="Semantics for Footprint Advertisement">
      <t>Roughly speaking, "footprint" can be defined as a dCDN's "ability
      and willingness to serve". However, in addition to simple ability and
      willingness to serve, the uCDN could want additional information before
      deciding which dCDN to select, e.g., "how well" a given dCDN can
      actually serve a given end user request.  The dCDN's ability and
      willingness to serve SHOULD be distinguished from the subjective
      qualitative measurement of how well it can serve a given end user
      request. One can imagine that such additional information is
      implicitly associated with a given footprint, due to contractual
      agreements, Service Level Agreements (SLAs), business relationships,
      or past perceptions of dCDN quality. As an alternative, such additional
      information could also be explicitly included with the given
      footprint.</t>

      <t>It is reasonable to assume that a significant part of the actual
      footprint advertisement will occur out-of-band, prior to any CDNI
      FCI advertisement, with footprints defined in contractual
      agreements between participating CDNs. The reason for this
      assumption is that any contractual agreement is likely to
      contain specifics about the dCDN coverage (footprint) to which
      the contractual agreement applies. In particular, additional
      information to judge the delivery quality associated with a
      given dCDN footprint might be defined in contractual agreements,
      outside of the CDNI FCI. Further, one can assume that dCDN contractual
      agreements about the delivery quality associated with a given footprint
      will probably be based on high&nbhy;level aggregated statistics and
      will not be too detailed.</t>

      <t>Given that a large part of the footprint advertisement will be
      defined in contractual agreements, the semantics of CDNI footprint
      advertisement refer to answering the following question: what exactly
      still needs to be advertised by the CDNI FCI? For instance, updates
      about temporal failures of part of a footprint can be useful information
      to convey via the CDNI Request Routing interface. Such information would
      provide updates on information previously agreed upon in contracts
      between the participating CDNs. In other words, the CDNI FCI is a
      means for a dCDN to provide changes/updates regarding a footprint
      it has previously agreed to serve in a contract with a uCDN.</t>

      <t>Generally speaking, one can imagine two categories of footprints to be
      advertised by a dCDN:
      
              <list style="symbols">
          <t>A footprint could be defined based on coverage/reachability,
          where "coverage/reachability" refers to a set of prefixes, a
          geographic region, or similar boundary. The dCDN claims that it
          can cover&wj;/reach "end user requests coming from this footprint".</t>

          <t>A footprint could be defined based on resources,
          where "resources" refers to Surrogates a dCDN claims to have
          (e.g., the location of Surrogates/resources). The dCDN claims
          that "from this footprint" it can serve incoming end user requests.</t>
        </list> 
      </t>        
        
        
      <t>For each of these footprint types, there are capabilities associated
      with a given footprint:
              <list style="symbols">
          <t>capabilities such as delivery protocol, redirection mode,
          and metadata, which are supported in the coverage area for a
          footprint that is defined by coverage/reachability, or</t>
          <t>capabilities of resources, such as delivery protocol,
          redirection mode, and metadata, which apply to a footprint
          that is defined by resources.</t>
        </list> 
      </t>
        
      <t>Resource footprint types are more specific than
      coverage&wj;/reachability footprint types, where the actual
      coverage and reachability are extrapolated from the resource
      location (e.g., a netmask applied to a resource IP address to derive
      an IP&nbsp;prefix).  The specific methods for extrapolating
      coverage&wj;/reachability from the resource location are beyond the
      scope of this document.  In the degenerate case, the resource
      address could be specified as a coverage/reachability footprint type,
      in which case no extrapolation is necessary. Resource footprint types
      could expose the internal structure of a CDN; this could be
      undesirable.  As such, the resource footprint types are not
      considered mandatory to support for CDNI.</t> 
      
      <t>
      Footprints can be viewed as constraints for delegating requests to a
      dCDN: a dCDN footprint advertisement tells the uCDN the limitations for
      delegating a request to the dCDN. For IP prefixes or ASN(s), the
      footprint signals to the uCDN that it should consider the dCDN a
      candidate only if the IP address of the Request Routing source falls
      within the prefix set (or ASN, respectively). The CDNI specifications do
      not define how a given uCDN determines what address ranges are in a
      particular ASN. Similarly, for country codes, a uCDN should only consider
      the dCDN a candidate if it covers the country of the Request Routing
      source. The CDNI specifications do not define how a given uCDN
      determines the country of the Request Routing source. Multiple footprint
      constraints are additive: the advertisement of different footprint types
      narrows the dCDN's candidacy cumulatively.</t>
      
      <t>Independent of the exact type of a footprint, a footprint might also
      include the connectivity of a given dCDN to other CDNs that are able
      to serve content to users on behalf of that dCDN, to cover cases with
      cascaded CDNs. Further, the dCDN needs to be able to express its
      footprint to an interested uCDN in a comprehensive form, e.g., as a
      data set containing the complete footprint. However, making incremental
      updates to express dynamic changes in state is also desirable.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec.semantics_capabilities"
             title="Semantics for Capabilities Advertisement">
      <t>In general, the dCDN needs to be able to express its general
      capabilities to the uCDN. These general capabilities could indicate
      if the dCDN supports a given service -- for instance, HTTP vs. HTTPS
      delivery. Furthermore, the dCDN needs to be able to express particular
      capabilities for service delivery in a particular footprint area. For
      example, the dCDN might in general offer HTTPS but not in some specific
      areas, either for maintenance reasons or because the Surrogates covering
      this particular area cannot deliver this type of service. Hence, in
      certain cases a footprint and capabilities are tied together and cannot
      be interpreted independently of each other. In such cases, i.e., where
      capabilities need to be expressed on a per&nbhy;footprint basis, it
      could be beneficial to combine footprint advertisement and capabilities
      advertisement.</t>

      <t>A high-level and very rough semantic for capabilities is thus the
      following: capabilities are types of information that allow a uCDN to
      determine if a dCDN is able (and willing) to accept (and
      properly handle) a delegated content request. In addition, capabilities
      are characterized by the fact that this information can change
      over time based on the state of the network or Surrogates.</t>

      <t>At first glance, several broad categories of capabilities seem
      useful to convey via an advertisement interface; however, advertising
      capabilities that change highly dynamically (e.g., real&nbhy;time
      delivery performance metrics, CDN resource load, or other highly
      dynamically changing QoS information) are beyond the scope of the CDNI
      FCI. First, out of the multitude of possible metrics and capabilities,
      it is hard to agree on a subset and the precise metrics to be used.
      Second, it seems infeasible to specify such highly dynamically changing
      capabilities and the corresponding metrics within a reasonable
      time&nbsp;frame.</t>

      <t>Useful capabilities refer to information that does not change highly
      dynamically and that, in many cases, is absolutely necessary for
      deciding on a particular dCDN for a given end user request.
      For instance, if an end user request concerns the delivery of a video
      file with a certain protocol, the uCDN needs to know if a given dCDN
      is capable of supporting this delivery protocol.</t>

      <t>Similar to footprint advertisement, it is reasonable to assume
      that a significant part of the actual (resource) capabilities
      advertisement will also occur out-of-band, prior to any CDNI FCI
      advertisement, with capabilities defined in contractual
      agreements between participating CDNs. The role of capability
      advertisement is hence rather to enable the dCDN to update a
      uCDN on changes since a contract has been set up (e.g.,
      in case a new delivery protocol is suddenly being added to the
      list of supported delivery protocols of a given dCDN or in case a
      certain delivery protocol is suddenly not being supported anymore due to
      failures). "Capabilities advertisement" thus refers to conveying
      information to a uCDN about changes/updates to certain capabilities
      with respect to a given contract.</t>

      <t>Given these semantics, it needs to be decided what exact capabilities
      are useful and how these can be expressed. Since the details of CDNI
      contracts are not known at the time of this writing (and the CDNI
      interface is better off being agnostic to these contracts anyway), it
      remains to be seen what capabilities will be used to define agreements
      between CDNs in practice. One implication for standardization could be to
      initially only specify a very limited set of mandatory capabilities for
      advertisement and have, on top of that, a flexible data model that allows
      exchanging additional capabilities when needed. Still, agreement needs
      to be reached regarding which capabilities (if any) will be mandatory among
      CDNs.</t>

      <t>It is not feasible to enumerate all the possible options for the
      mandatory capabilities listed above (e.g., all the potential delivery
      protocols or metadata options) or anticipate all the future needs for
      additional capabilities. FCI object extensibility is necessary to
      support future capabilities, as well as a generic protocol for
      conveying any capability information (e.g., with common encoding,
      error handling, and security mechanisms; further requirements for
      the CDNI FCI are listed in <xref target="RFC7337"/>).</t>
