    <abstract>
      <t>Source Description (SDES) items are normally transported in the RTP
      Control Protocol (RTCP). In some cases, it can be beneficial to speed up
      the delivery of these items.
The main case is when a new sychronization source
(SSRC) joins an RTP session and the receivers need this source's
identity, relation to other sources, or its synchronization context,
all of which may be fully or partially identified using SDES items.
To enable this optimization,
      this document specifies a new RTP header extension that can carry SDES
      items.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This specification defines an <xref target="RFC3550">RTP header
      extension</xref><xref target="RFC5285"/> that can carry RTCP Source
      Description (SDES) items. Normally, the SDES items are carried in their
      own <xref target="RFC3550">RTCP packet type</xref>. By including
      selected SDES items in a header extension, the determination of
      relationship and synchronization context for new RTP streams (SSRCs) in
      an RTP session can be optimized. Which relationship and what information
      depends on the SDES items carried. This becomes a complement to using
      only RTCP for SDES item delivery.</t>

      <t>It is important to note that not all SDES items are appropriate to
      transmit using RTP header extensions. Some SDES items perform binding
      or identify synchronization contexts with strict timeliness
      requirements, while many other SDES items do not have such requirements.
      In addition, security and privacy concerns for the SDES item information
      need to be considered. For example, the Name and Location SDES items are
      highly sensitive from a privacy perspective and should not be
      transported over the network without strong security. No use case has
      identified that such information is required when the
      first RTP packets arrive. A delay of a few seconds before such information is
      available to the receiver appears acceptable. Therefore, only appropriate
      SDES items, such
      as CNAME, will be registered for use with this header extension.</t>

      <t>Requirements language and terminology are defined in <xref target="term"/>.

      <xref target="motive"/> describes why this header extension is sometimes
      required or at least provides a significant improvement compared to
      waiting for regular RTCP packet transmissions of the information.
      
      <xref target="spec"/> provides a specification of the header extension
      and usage recommendations.
      
      <xref target="IANA"/> defines a subspace of the header extension URN
      to be used for existing and future SDES items and registers
      the appropriate existing SDES items.</t>

    <section title="Motivation" anchor="motive">
      <t>SDES items are associated with a particular SSRC
      and thus with a particular RTP stream. The Source Description items provide various metadata
      associated with the SSRC. How important it is to have this data no
      later than when the first RTP packets is received depends on the item
      itself. The CNAME item is one item that is commonly needed either at
      reception of the first RTP packet for this SSRC or at least by the time
      the first media can be played out. If it is not available, the
      synchronization context cannot be determined; thus, any related
      streams cannot be correctly synchronized. Therefore, this is a valuable
      example for having this information early when a new RTP stream is
      received.</t>

      <t>The main reason for new SSRCs in an RTP session is when media sources
      are added. This can be because either an endpoint is adding a new
      actual media source or additional participants in a multi-party session
      are added to the session. Another reason for a new SSRC can be an SSRC
      collision that forces both colliding parties to select new SSRCs.</t>

      <t>For the case of rapid media synchronization, one may use the RTP
      header extension for <xref target="RFC6051">rapid synchronization of RTP
      flows</xref>. This header extension carries the clock information
      present in the RTCP sender report (SR) packets. However, it assumes that
      the CNAME binding is known, which can be provided via signaling <xref
      target="RFC5576"/> in some cases, but not all. Thus, an RTP header
      extension for carrying SDES items like CNAME is a powerful combination
      to enable rapid synchronization in all cases.</t>

      <t>The "Rapid Synchronisation of RTP Flows" specification <xref
      target="RFC6051"/> does provide an
      analysis of the initial synchronization delay for different sessions
      depending on the number of receivers as well as on session bandwidth
      (Section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC6051"/>). These results are also applicable
      for other SDES items that have a similar time dependency until the
      information can be sent using RTCP. These figures can be used to
      determine the benefit of reducing the initial delay before information
      is available for some use cases.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC6051"></xref> also
      discusses the case of late joiners and defines an RTCP Feedback format
      to request synchronization information, which is another potential use
      case for SDES items in the RTP header extension. It would, for example, be
      natural to include a CNAME SDES item with the header extension containing
      the NTP-formatted reference clock to ensure synchronization.</t>

      <t>The ongoing work on <xref
      target="SDP-BUNDLE">bundling Session Description Protocol (SDP) media
      descriptions</xref> has identified a new SDES item that can benefit from
      timely delivery. A corresponding RTP SDES compact header extension is
      therefore also defined and registered in that document:<list
          style="hanging">
          <t hangText="MID:">This is a media description identifier that
          matches the value of the <xref target="RFC4566">SDP</xref> <xref target="RFC5888">a=mid attribute</xref>,
          to associate RTP streams multiplexed on the same transport with
          their respective SDP media description.</t>

    <section title="Specification" anchor="spec">
      <t>This section first specifies the SDES item RTP header extension
      format, followed by some usage considerations.</t>

      <section title="SDES Item Header Extension">
        <t>An RTP header extension scheme allowing for multiple extensions is
        defined in <xref target="RFC5285">"A General Mechanism for RTP Header
        Extensions"</xref>. That specification defines both short and long
        item headers. The short headers (one byte) are restricted to 1 to 16
        bytes of data, while the long format (two bytes) supports a data length
        of 0 to 255 bytes. Thus, the RTP header extension formats are capable
        of supporting any SDES item from a data length perspective.</t>

        <t>The ID field, independent of a short or long format, identifies both
        the type of RTP header extension and, in the case of the SDES item
        header extension, the type of SDES item. The mapping is done in
        signaling by identifying the header extension and SDES item type using
        a URN, which is defined in <xref target="IANA">
        </xref> ("IANA Considerations") for the known SDES items appropriate to use.</t>

        <section title="One-Byte Format">
          <t>The one-byte header format for an SDES item extension element
          consists of the one-byte header (defined in Section 4.2 of <xref
          target="RFC5285"/>), which consists of a 4-bit ID followed by a
          4-bit length field (len) that identifies the number of data bytes
          (len value +1) following the header. The data part consists of len+1
          bytes of <xref target="RFC3629">UTF-8</xref> text. The type of text
          and its mapping to the SDES item type are determined by the ID field
          value.</t>

      <section title="Usage of the SDES Item Header Extension">
        <t>This section discusses various usage considerations: which form of
        the header extension to use, the packet expansion, and when to send SDES
        items in the header extension.</t>

        <section title="One-Byte or Two-Byte Headers">
          <t>The RTP header extensions for SDES items MAY use either the
          one-byte or two-byte header formats, depending on the text value
          size for the used SDES items and the requirement from any other
          header extensions used. The one-byte header SHOULD be used when all
          non-SDES item header extensions support the one-byte format and all
          SDES item text values contain at most 16 bytes.
          Note that the <xref target="RFC5285">RTP
          header extension specification</xref> does not allow mixing one-byte and
          two-byte headers for the same RTP stream (SSRC), so if
          any SDES item requires the two-byte header,
          then all other header extensions MUST also use the two-byte header
          format.</t>

          <t>For example, if using CNAMEs that are generated according to <xref
          target="RFC7022">"Guidelines for Choosing RTP Control Protocol
          (RTCP) Canonical Names (CNAMEs)"</xref>, if using short-term persistent
          values, and if 96-bit random values prior to base64 encoding are
          sufficient, then they will fit into the one-byte header format.</t>

          <t>An RTP middlebox needs to take care choosing between one-byte
          headers and two-byte headers when creating the first packets for an
          outgoing stream (SSRC) with header extensions. First of all, it needs
          to consider all the header extensions that may potentially be used.
          Second, it needs to know the size of the SDES items that are going
          to be included and use two-byte headers if any are longer than 16
          bytes. An RTP middlebox that forwards a stream, i.e., not mixing it
          or combining it with other streams, may be able to base its choice on
          the header size in incoming streams. This is assuming that the
          middlebox does not modify the stream or add additional header
          extensions to the stream it sends, in which case it needs to make
          its own decision.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="MTU and Packet Expansion">
          <t>The RTP packet size will clearly increase when a header extension
          is included. How much depends on the type of header extensions and
          their data content. The SDES items can vary in size. There are also
          some use cases that require transmitting multiple SDES items in the
          same packet to ensure that all relevant data reaches the receiver.

          An example of that is when CNAME, a MID, and the rapid time
          synchronization extension from RFC 6051 are all needed. Such a
          combination is quite likely to result in at least 16+3+8 bytes of
          data plus the headers, which will be another 7 bytes for one-byte
          headers, plus two bytes of header padding to make the complete
          header extension 32-bit word aligned, thus 36 bytes in total.</t>

          <t>If the packet expansion cannot be taken into account when
          producing the RTP payload, it can cause an issue. An RTP payload
          that is created to meet a particular IP-level Maximum Transmission
          Unit (MTU), taking the addition of IP/UDP/RTP headers but not RTP
          header extensions into account, could exceed the MTU when the header
          extensions are present, thus resulting in IP fragmentation. IP
          fragmentation is known to negatively impact the loss rate due to
          middleboxes unwilling or not capable of dealing with IP fragments,
          as well as increasing the target surface for other types of packet
          losses.</t>

          <t>As this is a real issue, the media encoder and payload packetizer
          should be flexible and be capable of handling dynamically varying
          payload size restrictions to counter the packet expansion caused by
          header extensions. If that is not possible, some reasonable
	  worst-case packet expansion should be calculated and used to reduce
	  the
          RTP payload size of all RTP packets the sender transmits.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Transmission Considerations">
          <t>The general recommendation is to only send header extensions when
          needed. This is especially true for SDES items that can be sent in
          periodic repetitions of RTCP throughout the whole session. Thus, the
          <xref target="sec-different-usages">different usages</xref> have
          different recommendations. The following are some general
	  considerations for
          getting the header extensions delivered to the receiver:<list
              style="numbers">
              <t>The probability for packet loss and burst loss determine how
              many repetitions of the header extensions will be required to
              reach a targeted delivery probability and, if burst loss is
              likely, what distribution would be needed to avoid getting all
              repetitions of the header extensions lost in a single burst.</t>

              <t>If a set of packets are all needed to enable decoding, there
              is commonly no reason for including the header extension in all
              of these packets, as they share fate. Instead, at most one
              instance of the header extension per independently decodable set
              of media data would be a more efficient use of the
              bandwidth.</t>

              <t>How early the SDES item information is needed, from the first
              received RTP data or only after some set of packets are
              received, can guide if the header extension(s) should be in all
              of the first N packets or be included only once per set of
              packets, for example, once per video frame.</t>

              <t>The use of RTP-level robustness mechanisms, such as <xref
              target="RFC4588">RTP retransmission</xref> or forward error
              correction <xref target="RFC5109"> </xref>, may treat
              packets differently from a robustness perspective, and SDES
              header extensions should be added to packets that get a
              treatment corresponding to the relative importance of receiving
              the information.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>As a summary, the number of header extension transmissions should
          be tailored to a desired probability of delivery, taking the receiver
          population size into account. For the very basic case, N repetitions
          of the header extensions should be sufficient but may not be
          optimal. N is selected so that the header extension target delivery
          probability reaches 1-P^N, where P is the probability of packet
          loss. For point-to-point or small receiver populations, it might
          also be possible to use feedback, such as RTCP, to determine when
          the information in the header extensions has reached all receivers
          and to stop further repetitions. Feedback that can be used includes the
          <xref target="RFC3611">RTCP Extended Report (XR) Loss
          RLE Report Block</xref>, which
          indicates successful delivery of particular packets. If the
          RTP/AVPF <xref target="RFC4585">transport-layer feedback message
          for generic NACK</xref> is used, it can indicate the failure to
          deliver an RTP packet with the header extension, thus indicating the
          need for further repetitions. The normal RTCP report blocks can also
          provide an indicator of successful delivery, if no losses are
          indicated for a reporting interval covering the RTP packets with the
          header extension. Note that loss of an RTCP packet reporting on an
          interval where RTP header extension packets were sent does not
          necessarily mean that the RTP header extension packets themselves
          were lost.</t>

            middlebox is present, it can be responsible for transmitting the
            known information, possibly stored, to the new session participant
            only and not repeat it to all the session participants.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Information Change">
            <t>If the SDES information is tightly coupled with the RTP data,
            and the SDES information needs to be updated, then the use of the
            RTP header extension is superior to RTCP. Using the RTP header
            extension ensures that the information is updated on reception of
            the related RTP media, ensuring synchronization between the two.
            Continued use of the old SDES information can lead to undesired
            effects in the application. Thus, header extension transmission
            strategies with high probability of delivery should be chosen.</t>
          </section>
        </section>

        <section title="SDES Items in RTCP">
          <t>The RTP header extension information, i.e., SDES items, can and
          will be sent also in RTCP. Therefore, it is worth making some
          reflections on this interaction. As an alternative to the header
          extension, it is possible to schedule a non-regular RTCP packet
          transmission containing important SDES items, if one uses an
          RTP-/AVPF-based RTP profile. Depending on the mode in which one's RTCP
          feedback transmitter is working, extra RTCP packets may be sent
          as immediate or early packets, enabling more timely SDES information
          delivery.</t>

          <t>There are, however, two aspects that differ between using RTP
          header extensions and any non-regular transmission of RTCP packets.
          First, as the RTCP packet is a separate packet, there is no direct
          relation and also no fate sharing between the relevant media data
          and the SDES information. The order of arrival for the packets will
          matter. With a header extension, the SDES items can be ensured to
          arrive if the media data to play out arrives. Second, it is
          difficult to determine if an RTCP packet is actually delivered,
          as the RTCP packets lack both a sequence number and a mechanism
          providing feedback on the RTCP packets themselves.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Update Flaps">
          <t>The SDES item may arrive both in RTCP and in RTP header
          extensions, potentially causing the value to flap back and forth at
          the time of updating. There are at least two reasons for these
          flaps. The first one is packet reordering, where a pre-update RTP or
          RTCP packet with an SDES item is delivered to the receiver after the
          first RTP/RTCP packet with the updated value. The second reason is
          the different code paths for RTP and RTCP in implementations. An
          update to the sender's SDES item parameter can take a different time
          to propagate to the receiver than the corresponding media data. For
          example, an RTCP packet with the SDES item included that may have
          been generated prior to the update can still reside in a buffer and
          be sent unmodified. The update of the item's value can, at the same
          time, cause RTP packets to be sent including the header extension,
          prior to the RTCP packet being sent.</t>

          <t>However, most of these issues can be avoided by the receiver
          performing some checks before updating the receiver's stored value.
          To handle flaps caused by reordering, SDES items received in RTP
          packets with the same or a lower extended sequence number than the
          last change MUST NOT be applied, i.e., discard items that can be
          determined to be older than the current one. For compound RTCP
          packets, which will contain an SR packet (assuming an
          active RTP sender), the receiver can use the RTCP SR timestamp field
          to determine at what approximate time it was transmitted. If the
          timestamp is earlier than the last received RTP packet with a header
          extension carrying an SDES item, and especially if carrying a
          previously used value, the SDES item in the RTCP SDES packet can be
          ignored. Note that media processing and transmission pacing can
          easily cause the RTP header timestamp field as well as the RTCP SR
          timestamp field to not match with the actual transmission time.</t>

        <section title="RTP Header Compression">
          <t>When <xref target="RFC5225">Robust Header Compression
          (ROHC)</xref> is used with RTP, the <xref target="RFC5285">RTP
          header extension</xref> data itself is not part of what is being
          compressed and thus does not impact header compression performance.
          The extension indicator (X) bit in the RTP header is, however,
          compressed. It is classified as rarely changing, which may no longer
          be true for all RTP header extension usage, in turn leading to lower
          header compression efficiency.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Source Description items may contain data that are sensitive from a
      security perspective. There are SDES items that are or may be sensitive
      from a user privacy perspective, like CNAME, NAME, EMAIL, PHONE, LOC, and
      H323-CADDR. Some may contain sensitive information, like NOTE and PRIV,
      while others may be sensitive from profiling implementations for
      vulnerability or other reasons, like TOOL. The CNAME sensitivity can
      vary depending on how it is generated and what persistence it has. A
      <xref target="RFC7022">short-term CNAME identifier generated using a
      random number generator</xref> may have minimal security implications,
      while a CNAME of the form user@host has privacy concerns, and a CNAME
      generated from a Media Access Control (MAC) address has long-term tracking potentials.</t>

      <t>In RTP sessions where any type of confidentiality protection is
      enabled for RTCP, the SDES item header extensions MUST also be
      protected. This implies that to provide confidentiality, users of the 
      Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
      need to implement and use encrypted header extensions per <xref
      target="RFC6904"/>. SDES items carried as RTP header extensions MUST
      then use commensurate strength algorithms and SHOULD use the same
      cryptographic primitives (algorithms, modes) as applied to RTCP packets
      carrying corresponding SDES items. 

If the security level is chosen to be
      different for an SDES item in RTCP and an RTP header extension, it is
      important to justify the exception and to consider the security
      properties as the worst in each aspect for the different configurations.
      It is worth noting that the current <xref target="RFC3711">SRTP</xref> only provides protection for the next trusted RTP/RTCP
      hop, which is not necessarily end to end.</t>

      <t>The <xref target="RFC5285">general RTP header extension
      mechanism</xref> does not itself contain any functionality that is a
      significant risk for a denial&nbhy;of&nbhy;service attack, neither from processing
      nor from storage requirements. The extension for SDES items defined in this
      document can potentially be a risk. The risk depends on the received
      SDES item and its content. If the SDES item causes the receiver to
      perform a large amount of processing, create significant storage
      structures, or emit network traffic, such a risk does exist. The CNAME
      SDES item in the RTP header extension is only a minor risk, as reception
      of a CNAME item will create an association between the stream carrying
      the SDES item and other RTP streams with the same SDES item. This
      usually results in time synchronizing the media streams; thus, some
      additional processing is performed. However, the application's media
      quality is likely more affected by an erroneous or changing association
      and media synchronization than the application quality impact caused by
      the additional processing.</t>

      <t>As the SDES items are used by the RTP-based application to establish
      relationships between RTP streams or between an RTP stream and
      information about the originating participant, there SHOULD be strong
      integrity protection and source authentication of the header extensions.
      If not, an attacker can modify the SDES item value to create erroneous
      relationship bindings in the receiving application. For information
      regarding options for securing RTP, see <xref target="RFC7201"/>.</t>
