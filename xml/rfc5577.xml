			<t>International Telecommunication Union
			(ITU-T) Recommendation G.722.1 is a wide-band
			audio codec. This document describes the
			payload format for including G.722.1-generated
			bit streams within an RTP packet.  The
			document also describes the syntax and
			semantics of the Session Description Protocol
			(SDP) parameters needed to support G.722.1
			audio codec.</t>

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>ITU-T G.722.1 <xref target="ITU.G7221"/> is
			a low-complexity coder; it compresses 50 Hz -
			14 kHz audio signals into one of the following
			bit rates: 24 kbit/s, 32 kbit/s, or 48
			kbit/s.</t>

			<t>The coder may be used for speech, music,
			and other types of audio.</t>

			<t> Some of the applications for which this
			coder is suitable are:</t>
 
			<t><list style="symbols">
					<t>Real-time communications
					such as videoconferencing and
					telephony</t>
					<t>Streaming audio</t>
					<t>Archival and messaging</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>ITU-T G.722.1 <xref target="ITU.G7221"/>
			uses 20-ms frames and a sampling rate clock of
			16 kHz or 32kHz.&nbsp;&nbsp;The encoding and decoding
			algorithm can change the bit rate at any 20-ms
			frame boundary, but no bit rate change
			notification is provided in-band with the bit
			stream.</t>

			<t>For any given bit rate, the number of bits
			in a frame is a constant. Within this fixed
			frame, G.722.1 uses variable-length coding
			(e.g.,  Huffman coding) to represent most of
			the encoded parameters.  All variable-length
			codes are transmitted in order from the
			leftmost bit (most significant bit -- MSB) to 
                        the rightmost bit (least significant bit -- LSB), see
			<xref target="ITU.G7221" /> for more details.    </t>

			<t>The ITU-T standardized bit rates for
			G.722.1 are 24 kbit/s or 32kbit/s at 16 Khz
			sample rate, and 24 kbit/s, 32 kbit/s, or 48
			kbit/s at 32 Khz sample rate.  However, the
			coding algorithm itself has the capability to
			run at any user-specified bit rate (not just
			24, 32, and 48 kbit/s) while maintaining an
			audio bandwidth of 50 Hz to 14 kHz. This rate
			change is accomplished by a linear scaling of
			the codec operation, resulting in frames with
			size in bits equal to 1/50 of the
			corresponding bit rate. </t>

				<t>Because bit rate is not signaled
				in-band, a separate out-of-band method
				is REQUIRED to indicate the bit rate
				(see <xref target="SDPparam" /> for an example of
				signaling bit rate information using
				SDP). For the payload format specified
				here, the bit rate MUST remain
				constant for a particular payload type
				value. An application MAY switch bit
				rates and clock rates from packet to
				packet by defining different payload
				type values and switching between
				them.</t>

				<t>The use of Huffman coding means
				that it is not possible to identify
				the various encoded parameters/fields
				contained within the bit stream
				without first completely decoding the
				entire frame. For the purposes of
				packetizing the bit stream in RTP, it
				is only necessary to consider the
				sequence of bits as output by the
				G.722.1 encoder and to present the same
				sequence to the decoder.  The payload
				format described here maintains this
				sequence.</t>

				<t>When operating at 24 kbit/s, 480
				bits (60 octets) are produced per
				frame. When operating at 32 kbit/s,
				640 bits (80 octets) are produced per
				frame. When operating at 48 kbit/s,
				960 bits (120 octets) are produced per
				frame.  Thus, all three bit rates
				allow for octet alignment without the
				need for padding bits.</t>

				G.722.1 bit stream MUST be mapped into
				an octet-aligned RTP payload.</t>

				<t>When operating at non-standard

				value that is a  multiple of 400 (this maintains
				octet alignment and does not then
				require (undefined) padding bits for
				each frame if not octet aligned).  For
				example, a bit rate of 16.4 kbit/s
				will result in a frame of size 328
				bits or 41 octets, which is mapped

			<section title="Multiple G.722.1 Frames in an RTP Packet">
			<t> A sender may include more than one
			consecutive G.722.1 frame in a single
			RTP packet.</t>

			<t>Senders have the following additional restrictions:</t>

			<t><list style="symbols">
			<t>Sender SHOULD NOT include more G.722.1
			frames in a single RTP packet than will fit in
			the MTU of the RTP transport protocol.</t>

			<t>All frames contained in a single RTP packet
			MUST be of the same length and sampled at the
			same clock rate. They MUST have the same bit
			rate (octets per frame).</t>

			<t>Frames MUST NOT be split between RTP packets.</t>
					</list>
				</t>

			<t>It is RECOMMENDED that the number of frames
			contained within an RTP packet be consistent
			with the application.  For example, in a
			telephony application where delay is
			important, the fewer frames per packet,
			the lower the delay; whereas for a
			delay-insensitive streaming or messaging
			application, many frames per packet would be
			acceptable.</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Computing the Number of G.722.1 Frames">
			<t>Information describing the number
			of frames contained in an RTP packet
			is not transmitted as part of the RTP
			payload.  The only way to determine
			the number of G.722.1 frames is to
			count the total number of octets
			within the RTP packet and divide the
			octet count by the number of expected
			octets per frame. This expected
			octet-per-frame count is derived from the bit
			rate and is therefore a function of the
			payload type.</t>

			<t>The combination of the clock rate in the

			<t>RTP packets using the payload format
			defined in this specification are subject to
			the security considerations discussed in the
			RTP specification <xref target="RFC3550"/> and
			any appropriate RTP profile. The main
   security considerations for the RTP packet carrying the RTP payload
   format defined within this memo are confidentiality, integrity, and
   source authenticity.  Confidentiality is achieved by encryption of
   the RTP payload.  Integrity of the RTP packets is achieved through a
   suitable cryptographic integrity-protection mechanism.  Such a
   cryptographic system may also allow the authentication of the source
   of the payload.  A suitable security mechanism for this RTP payload
   format should provide confidentiality, integrity protection, and at
   least source authentication capable of determining if an RTP packet
   is from a member of the RTP session.</t>
			<t>
   Note that the appropriate mechanism to provide security to RTP and
   payloads following this memo may vary.  It is dependent on the
   application, the transport, and the signaling protocol employed.
   Therefore, a single mechanism is not sufficient; although, if
   suitable, usage of the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) is
 <xref target="RFC3711"/> recommended.  Another mechanism that may be used is
   IPsec <xref target="RFC4301"/> Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   <xref target="RFC5246"/> (RTP over TCP); other alternatives may exist.
</t>
			<t>This RTP payload format and its media
			decoder do not exhibit any significant
			non-uniformity in the receiver-side
			computational complexity for packet
			processing, and thus are unlikely to pose a
			denial-of-service threat due to the receipt of
			pathological data. Nor does the RTP payload
			format contain any active content.</t>
