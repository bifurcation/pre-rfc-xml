<keyword>domainroot, domain root file system</keyword>


        <abstract><t>
The NFS version 4 (NFSv4) protocol provides a mechanism for a collection of NFS file servers to collaborate
in providing an organization-wide file namespace.  The DNS SRV Resource Record
(RR) allows a simple 
way for an organization to publish the root of its file system
namespace, even to clients that might not be
intimately associated with such an organization.  The DNS SRV RR can be used to join these
organization-wide file namespaces together to allow construction of a global, uniform NFS
file namespace.
</t></abstract>
    </front>

    <middle>



	  <section title="Background" anchor="background">
		<t>
Version 4 of the NFS protocol <xref target="RFC3530" /> introduced the fs_locations attribute.  
Use of this attribute was elaborated further in the NFSv4 minor version 1 protocol <xref target="RFC5661" />,
which also defined an extended version of the attribute as fs_locations_info.
With the advent of these attributes, NFS servers can
cooperate to build a file namespace that crosses server boundaries.
The fs_locations and fs_locations_info attributes are used as referrals, so that a file
server may indicate to its client that the file name tree beneath
a given name in the server is not present on itself but is represented by a file system in some other
set of servers.  The mechanism
is general, allowing servers to describe any file system as being reachable by requests to any of a
set of servers.
Thus, starting with a single NFSv4 server, using these referrals, an NFSv4 client
could see a large namespace associated with a collection of interrelated NFSv4 file servers.  An organization could use this
capability to construct a uniform file namespace for itself.
</t><t>
An organization might wish to publish the starting point for this namespace to its clients.  In many
cases, the organization will want to publish this starting point to a broader set of possible clients.
At the same time, it is useful to require that clients know only the smallest amount
of information in order to locate the appropriate namespace.
Also, that required
information should be constant through the life of an organization if the clients are not to require
reconfiguration as administrative events change, for instance, a server's name or address.

            "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
            and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
            described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
        </section>


	  <section title="Use of the SRV Resource Record in DNS" anchor="use_srv_dns">
<t>
Providing an organization's published file system namespace is a service, and
the DNS <xref target="RFC1034" /><xref target="RFC1035" /> provides methods for discovery of
that service.
This standard defines a mapping from a DNS name to the NFS file system(s)
providing the root of the file system namespace associated with that
DNS name; such file systems are called "domain root" file systems.  From such file systems, like other
NFS file systems, an NFS client can use the standard NFS mechanisms to navigate the rest of the
NFS file servers that make up the file system namespace for the given domain.
</t>


<t>
Such domain root file systems are mounted at a conventional point in the NFS
client namespace.
The mechanism results in a uniform cross-organizational file namespace, similar to that seen in both
AFS <xref target="AFS" /><xref target="RFC5864" /> and 
Distributed Computing
Environment / Distributed File System (DCE/DFS) <xref target="DFS" />.  An NFS client need know only the
domain name for an organization in order to locate the file namespace published by that
organization.
</t>
<t>
The DNS SRV RR type <xref target="RFC2782" /> is used to locate domain root file servers.
  The
format of the DNS SRV record is as follows:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   _Service._Proto.Name TTL Class SRV Priority Weight Port Target
]]></artwork></figure>
The Service name used is "_nfs-domainroot", in conformance with RFC 6335 <xref target="RFC6335" />.
The Protocol name used is "_tcp", for NFS service over TCP.  Future NFS services using other protocols
MUST use another protocol name.
The "_udp" label MUST NOT be used to imply use of UDP with NFSv4, as neither RFC 3530
<xref target="RFC3530" /> nor RFC 5661 <xref target="RFC5661" /> defines NFSv4 over UDP.
The Target fields 
give the domain names of the NFS servers that export file systems for the domain's root.
An NFS client may then interpret any of the exported root file systems as the
root of the file system published by the organization
with the given domain name.
</t><t>
The domain root service is not useful for NFS versions prior to version 4, as the fs_locations attribute
was introduced only in NFSv4 (as described in <xref target="background"/>).
</t><t>
In order to allow the NFSv4 servers as given to export a variety of file systems, those file servers
MUST export the given domain's root file systems at "/.domainroot/{Name}" within
their pseudo-file systems, where the "{Name}" is the name of the organization as used in the SRV RR.
</t>
<t>
As an example, suppose a client wished to locate the root of the file system published by organization example.net.  The
DNS servers for the domain would publish records like
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   $ORIGIN example.net.
   _nfs-domainroot._tcp IN SRV 0 0 2049 nfs1tr.example.net.
   _nfs-domainroot._tcp IN SRV 1 0 18204 nfs2ex.example.net.
]]></artwork></figure>
The resulting domain names nfs1tr.example.net and nfs2ex.example.net indicate NFSv4 file servers that
export the root of the published namespace for the example.net domain.  In accordance with RFC 2782 <xref target="RFC2782" />,
these records are to be interpreted using the Priority and Weight field values, selecting an appropriate
file server with which to begin a network conversation.  The two file servers would export file systems
that would be found at "/.domainroot/example.net" in their pseudo-file systems, which clients would mount.
Clients then carry out subsequent accesses in accordance with the ordinary NFSv4 protocol.
The first record uses the port number 2049 assigned to NFS, and another port is specified for the second
record; the NFS servers would provide NFS service at their indicated port numbers, and NFS clients would connect to
the service via the corresponding port numbers on those indicated servers.
</t><t>
Other file system protocols could make use of the same domain root
abstraction, 
but it is necessary to use different Service names not specified
here.
</t>
	  </section>

	  <section title="Integration with Use of NFS Version 4">
<t>
NFSv4 clients adhering to this specification implement a special directory, analogous to an Automounter
<xref target="AMD1" /><xref target="AMD2" />
directory, the entries in which are domain names that have recently been traversed.  When an application attempts to
traverse a new name in that special directory, the NFSv4 client consults DNS to obtain the SRV data for the given name,
and if successful, it mounts the indicated file system(s) in that name in the special directory.
The goal is that NFSv4 applications will be able to look up an organization's domain name in the special directory,
and the NFSv4 client will be able to discover the file system that the organization publishes.
Entries in the special directory will be domain names, and they will each appear to the application as a directory name
pointing to the root directory of the file system published by the organization responsible for that domain name.
</t><t>
As noted in <xref target="use_srv_dns"/>, the domain root service is not useful for NFS versions prior to version 4.
</t>
		<section title="Globally Useful Names: Conventional Mount Point">
<t>
In order for the inter-organizational namespace to function as a global file namespace,
the client-side mount point for that namespace must be the same on
different clients.  Conventionally, on Portable Operating System Interface
(POSIX) machines, the name "/nfs4/" is used so that names on one machine will
be directly usable on any machine.  Thus, the example.net published file system
would be accessible as
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
        /nfs4/example.net/
]]></artwork></figure>
on any POSIX client.  Using this convention, "/nfs4/" is the name of the special directory that is populated with
domain names, leading to file servers and file systems that capture the results of SRV record lookups.
</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Mount Options">
<t>
SRV records are necessarily less complete than the information in the existing NFSv4 attributes fs_locations
<xref target="RFC3530" /> or fs_locations_info <xref target="RFC5661" />.
For the rootpath field of fs_location, or the fli_fs_root field of fs_locations_info, NFS servers MUST use
the "/.domainroot/{Name}" string.  Thus,
the servers listed as targets for the SRV RRs MUST export the root of the organization's published
file system as the directory "/.domainroot/{Name}" (for the given organization
Name) in their exported NFS namespaces.
For example, for organization example.net, the directory "/.domainroot/example.net" would be used.
</t><t>
Section 11 of the NFSv4.1 document <xref target="RFC5661" /> describes the approach that an
NFS client should take to navigate fs_locations_info information.
</t><t>
The process of mounting an organization's namespace should permit the use
of what is likely to impose the lowest cost on the server.  Thus, the NFS client SHOULD NOT insist
on using a writable copy of the file system if read-only copies exist, or a zero-age copy rather than a
copy that may be a little older.  The organization's file system representatives can be navigated
to provide access to higher-cost properties such as writability or freshness as necessary, but the default
use when navigating to the base information for an organization ought to be as low-overhead as possible.
</t>
		</section>
	  <section title="File System Integration Issues">
<t>
The result of the DNS search SHOULD appear as a (pseudo-)directory in the client namespace.
A further refinement is RECOMMENDED: that only fully qualified domain names appear as directories.  That is, in many
environments, DNS names may be abbreviated from their fully qualified form.  In
such circumstances, multiple names might be given to
NFS clients that all resolve to the same DNS SRV RRs.
The abbreviated form SHOULD be represented in the client's namespace cache
as a symbolic link, pointing to the fully qualified name.  This will allow pathnames obtained with,
say, getcwd() to include the DNS name that is most likely to be usable
outside the scope of any particular DNS abbreviation convention.
</t>
		</section>
	  <section title="Multicast DNS">
<t>
Location of the NFS domain root by this SRV record is intended to be performed
with unicast by using the ordinary DNS <xref target="RFC1034" /><xref target="RFC1035" /> 
protocol. 
</t><t>
This document does not define the use of this DNS SRV record format in conjunction with
Multicast DNS (mDNS).  While mDNS could be used
to locate a local domain root via these SRV records, no other domain's root could
be discovered.  This means that mDNS has too little value
to use in locating NFSv4 domain roots.
</t>
	  </section>
	  </section>

	  <section title="Where Is This Integration Carried Out?">
<t>
The NFS client is responsible for interpreting SRV records.  
Using something like Automounter <xref target="AMD1" /> <xref target="AMD2" /> technology, the client interprets names
under a particular directory, by first discovering the appropriate file system to mount and then mounting
it in the specified place in the client namespace before returning control to the application doing a lookup.
The result of the DNS lookup should be cached (obeying Time to Live (TTL)) so
that the result could be returned more quickly the next time.
</t>
	  </section>

        <section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
This functionality introduces a new reliance of NFSv4 on the integrity of DNS.
Forged SRV records in DNS could cause the NFSv4 client to connect to the file servers
of an attacker, rather than the legitimate file servers of an organization.
This is similar to attacks that can be made on the base NFSv4 protocol, if server names
are given in fs_location attributes: the client can be made to connect to the
file servers of an attacker, not the file servers intended to be the target for
the fs_location attributes.
</t><t>
If DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) <xref target="RFC4033" /> is available, it SHOULD be used to avoid both such attacks.
Domain-based service principal names are an additional mechanism that also apply in this case, and it would
be prudent to use them.  They provide a mapping from the domain name that the user specified to
names of security principals used on the NFSv4 servers that are indicated as the targets
in the SRV records (as providing file service for the root file systems).
</t><t>
With domain-based service principal names, the idea is that one wants to authenticate 
{nfs, domainname, host.fqdn}, not simply {nfs, host.fqdn}, when the
server is a domain's root file server obtained through a DNS SRV RR lookup that may or may not have
been secure.
The domain administrator can thus ensure that only domain root NFSv4 servers have
credentials for such domain-based service principal names.
</t>
<t>Domain-based service principal names are defined in RFCs 5178 <xref
target="RFC5178" /> and
5179 <xref target="RFC5179" />.  To make use of RFC 5178's domain-based names, the syntax for "domain-based-name"
MUST be used with a service of "nfs", a domain matching the name of the organization whose root file system
is being sought, and a hostname given in the target of the DNS SRV RR.  Thus, in the example above,
two file servers (nfs1tr.example.net and nfs2ex.example.net) are located as hosting the root file system for
the organization example.net.  To communicate with, for instance, the second of the given file servers,
Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) is used with the name-type of GSS_C_NT_DOMAINBASED_SERVICE
defined in RFC 5178 and with a symbolic name of
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
        nfs@example.net@nfs2ex.example.net
]]></artwork></figure>
in order to verify that the named server (nfs2ex.example.net) is authorized to provide the root file system
for the example.net organization.
</t><t>
NFSv4 itself contains a facility for the negotiation of security mechanisms
to be used between NFS clients and NFS servers.  Section 3.3 of RFC 3530 <xref target="RFC3530"/>
and Section 2.6 of RFC 5661 <xref target="RFC5661"/> both describe how security
mechanisms are to be negotiated.  As such, there is no need for this document
to describe how that negotiation is to be carried out when the NFS client
contacts the NFS server for the specified domain root file system(s).
</t><t>
Using SRV records to advertise the locations of NFS servers
may expose those NFS servers to attacks.  Organizations should carefully consider
whether they wish their DNS servers to respond differentially to different
DNS clients, perhaps exposing their SRV records to only those DNS requests
that originate within a given perimeter, in order to reduce this exposure.
