            <t> This document presents use cases for diverse industries that have in common a need
                for "deterministic flows". "Deterministic" in this context means that such flows
                provide guaranteed bandwidth, bounded latency, and other properties germane to the
                transport of time-sensitive data. These use cases differ notably in their network
                topologies and specific desired behavior, providing as a group broad industry
                context for Deterministic Networking (DetNet). For each use case, this document will identify the use case,
                identify representative solutions used today, and describe potential improvements
                that DetNet can enable.</t>

        <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
            <t> This memo documents use cases for diverse industries that require deterministic
                flows over multi-hop paths. Deterministic Networking (DetNet) flows can be established from either a Layer 2 or
                Layer 3 (IP) interface, and such flows can coexist on an IP network with
                best-effort traffic. DetNet also provides for highly reliable flows through
                provision for redundant paths. </t>

            <t>The DetNet use cases explicitly do not suggest any specific design for DetNet
                architecture or protocols; these are topics for other DetNet
                documents. </t>

            <t> The DetNet use cases, as originally submitted, explicitly were
            not considered by the DetNet Working Group (WG) to be concrete
            requirements. The DetNet WG and Design Team considered these use
            cases, identifying which of their elements could be
            feasibly implemented within the charter of DetNet; as a
            result, certain originally submitted use cases (or elements
            thereof) were moved to <xref target="use-cases-out-of-scope"/>
            ("Use Cases Explicitly Out of Scope for DetNet") of this
            document.</t>

            <t>This document provides context regarding DetNet design decisions. It
               also serves a long-lived purpose of helping those learning (or new to) DetNet 
                understand the types of applications that can be supported by DetNet. It also allows
                those WG contributors who are users to ensure that their concerns are addressed by
                the WG; for them, this document (1)&nbsp;covers their
                contributions and (2)&nbsp;provides a long-term reference
                regarding the problems that they expect will be served by the
                technology, in terms of the short-term deliverables and 
                also as the technology evolves in the future.</t>

            <t>This document has served as a "yardstick" against which proposed
               DetNet designs can be measured, answering the question "To what extent does a
                proposed design satisfy these various use cases?" </t>

            <t>The industries covered by the use cases in this document
            are</t>

                    <t> What is the use case? </t>

                </list>
            </t>
            <t> The level of detail in each use case is intended to be
            sufficient to express the relevant elements of the use case but
            no more than that.</t>

            <t>DetNet does not directly address clock distribution or time synchronization; these
                are considered to be part of the overall design and implementation of a
                time-sensitive network, using existing (or future) time-specific protocols (such as
                    <xref target="IEEE-8021AS"/> and/or <xref

            <section title="Use Case Description">
                <t>The professional audio and video industry ("ProAV") includes: <list
            style="symbols">
            <t> Music and film content creation </t>
            <t> Broadcast </t>
            <t> Cinema </t>
            <t> Live sound </t>
            <t> Public address, media, and emergency systems at large venues
                (e.g., airports, stadiums, churches, theme parks)</t>
                    </list>
                </t>

                <t> These industries have already transitioned audio and video signals from analog
                    to digital. However, the digital interconnect systems remain primarily
                    point to point, with a single signal or a small number of signals per link,
                    interconnected with purpose-built hardware.</t>

                <t>These industries are now transitioning to packet-based infrastructures to reduce
                    cost, increase routing flexibility, and integrate with existing IT
                    infrastructures. </t>

                <t>Today, ProAV applications have no way to establish deterministic flows from a
                    standards-based Layer 3 (IP) interface; this is a
                    fundamental limitation of the
                    use cases described here. Today, deterministic flows can be created within
                    standards-based Layer 2 LANs (e.g., using IEEE 802.1 TSN ("TSN" stands for "Time-Sensitive Networking")); however, these flows are not
                    routable via IP and thus are not effective for distribution over wider areas
                    (for example, broadcast events that span wide geographical
                    areas).</t>

                <t>It would be highly desirable if such flows could be routed over the open
                    Internet; however, solutions of more-limited scope (e.g., enterprise networks)
                    would still provide substantial improvements.</t>

                <t>The following sections describe specific ProAV use cases.</t>

                <section title="Uninterrupted Stream Playback">
                    <t>Transmitting audio and video streams for live playback is unlike common file
            transfer in that uninterrupted stream playback in the presence of network
            errors cannot be achieved by retrying the transmission; by the time the
            missing or corrupt packet has been identified, it is too late to execute a
            retry operation. Buffering can be used to provide enough delay to allow
            time for one or more retries; however, this is not an effective solution in
            applications where large delays (latencies) are not acceptable (as discussed
            below).</t>
                    <t>Streams with guaranteed bandwidth can eliminate congestion on the network as
            a cause of transmission errors that would lead to playback
            interruption. The use
            of redundant paths can further mitigate transmission errors
            and thereby provide greater stream reliability.</t>
                    <t>Additional techniques, such as Forward Error Correction
                    (FEC), can also be used to
            improve stream reliability.</t>
                </section>

                <section title="Synchronized Stream Playback">
                    <t>Latency in this context is the time between when a signal is initially sent
            over a stream and when it is received. A common example in ProAV is
            time-synchronizing audio and video when they take separate paths through the
            playback system. In this case, the latency of both the audio
            stream and the video stream must be bounded and consistent if the sound is to remain matched to
            the movement in the video. A common tolerance for audio/video synchronization is one
            National Television System Committee (NTSC) video frame (about 33&nbsp;ms); to maintain the audience's perception of
            correct lip-sync, the latency needs to be consistent within some reasonable
            tolerance -- for example, 10%.</t>
                    <t>A common architecture for synchronizing multiple streams that have different
            paths through the network (and thus potentially different latencies) enables measurement of the latency of each path and has the data sinks (for
            example, speakers) delay (buffer) all packets on all but the slowest path.
            Each packet of each stream is assigned a presentation time that is based on
            the longest required delay. This implies that all sinks must maintain a
            common time reference of sufficient accuracy, which can be
            achieved by various techniques.</t>
                    <t>This type of architecture is commonly implemented using a central controller
            that determines path delays and arbitrates buffering delays.</t>
                </section>

                <section title="Sound Reinforcement">
                    <t>Consider the latency (delay) between the time when a person speaks into a microphone and
            when their voice emerges from the speaker. If this delay is longer than
            about 10&nbhy;15&nbsp;ms, it is noticeable and can make a sound-reinforcement
            system unusable (see slide 6 of <xref target="SRP_LATENCY"/>). (If you have ever tried to
            speak in the presence of a delayed echo of your voice, you might
            be familiar with this experience.)</t>
                  <t>Note that the 15&nbsp;ms latency bound includes all
    parts of the signal path -- not just the network -- so the
    network latency must be significantly less than 15&nbsp;ms.</t>
                    <t>In some cases, local performers must perform in synchrony with a remote
            broadcast. In such cases, the latencies of the broadcast stream and the local
            performer must be adjusted to match each other, with a worst case of one
            video frame (33&nbsp;ms for NTSC video). </t>
                    <t>In cases where audio phase is a consideration -- for
                    example, beam&nbhy;forming using multiple speakers -- latency can be in the 10&nbsp;us range (one audio sample at 96&nbsp;kHz).</t>

                <section title="Secure Transmission">
                    <section title="Safety">
            <t>Professional audio systems can include amplifiers that are capable of
               generating hundreds or thousands of watts of audio power. If used
                incorrectly, such amplifiers can cause hearing damage to those in the vicinity. Apart
                from the usual care required by the systems operators to prevent such
                incidents, the network traffic that controls these devices must be
                secured (as with any sensitive application traffic). </t>

            </section>

            <section title="Pro Audio Today">
             <t>Some proprietary systems have been created that enable deterministic streams at
                Layer 3; however, they are "engineered networks" that require careful
                configuration to operate and often require that the system
                be over-provisioned.  Also, it is implied that all devices on
                the network voluntarily play by the rules of
                that network. To enable these industries to successfully transition to an
                    interoperable multi-vendor packet-based infrastructure requires effective open
                    standards. Establishing relevant IETF standards is a crucial factor.</t>

            <section title="Pro Audio in the Future">

                <section title="Layer 3 Interconnecting Layer 2 Islands">
                    <t>It would be valuable to enable IP to connect multiple Layer 2 LANs. </t>
                    <t>As an example, ESPN constructed a state-of-the-art
194,000&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;ft., $125-million broadcast studio called
"Digital Center 2" (DC2). The DC2 network is capable of handling
            46&nbsp;Tbps of throughput with 60,000 simultaneous signals. Inside the facility
            are 1,100&nbsp;miles of fiber feeding four audio control rooms (see <xref
                target="ESPN_DC2"/>).</t>
                    <t>In designing DC2, they replaced as much point-to-point technology as they
            could with packet-based technology. They constructed seven individual
            studios using Layer 2 LANs (using IEEE 802.1 TSN) that were entirely
            effective at routing audio within the LANs.
 However, to interconnect these
            Layer 2 LAN islands together, they ended up using dedicated paths in a custom
            SDN (Software-Defined Networking) router because there is no standards-based
            routing solution available.</t>
                </section>

                <section title="High-Reliability Stream Paths">
                    <t>On-air and other live media streams are often backed up with redundant links
            that seamlessly act to deliver the content when the primary link fails for
            any reason. In point-to-point systems, this redundancy is provided by an additional
            point-to-point link; the analogous requirement in a packet-based system is
            to provide an alternate path through the network such that no individual
            link can bring down the system. </t>
                </section>

                <section title="Integration of Reserved Streams into IT Networks">
                    <t>A commonly cited goal of moving to a packet-based media infrastructure is
            that costs can be reduced by using off-the-shelf, commodity-network
            hardware. In addition, economy of scale can be realized by combining media
            infrastructure with IT infrastructure. In keeping with these goals, stream-reservation technology should be compatible with existing
            protocols and should not compromise the use of the network for
            best-effort (non-time-sensitive) traffic.</t>
                </section>

                <section title="Use of Unused Reservations by Best-Effort Traffic">
                    <t>In cases where stream bandwidth is reserved but not currently used (or is
            underutilized), that bandwidth must be available to
best&nbhy;effort (i.e., non-time-sensitive) traffic. For example, a single stream may be
 "nailed up"
            (reserved) for specific media content that needs to be presented at
            different times of the day, ensuring timely delivery of that content, yet in
            between those times the full bandwidth of the network can be utilized for
            best-effort tasks such as file transfers.</t>
                    <t>This also addresses a concern of IT network administrators that are
            considering adding reserved-bandwidth traffic to their networks that "users
            will reserve large quantities of bandwidth and then never unreserve it even
            though they are not using it, and soon the network will have no bandwidth
            left."</t>
                </section>

                <section title="Traffic Segregation">
                    <t>Sink devices may be low-cost devices with limited processing power. In order
            to not overwhelm the CPUs in these devices, it is important to limit the
            amount of traffic that these devices must process.</t>
                    <t>As an example, consider the use of individual seat speakers in a cinema.
            These speakers are typically required to be cost reduced, since the
            quantities in a single theater can reach hundreds of seats. Discovery
            protocols alone in a 1,000-seat theater can generate enough broadcast
            traffic to overwhelm a low-powered CPU. Thus, an installation like this will
            benefit greatly from some type of traffic segregation that can define groups
            of seats to reduce traffic within each group. All seats in the theater must
            still be able to communicate with a central controller.</t>
                    <t>There are many techniques that can be used to support this feature, including
            (but not limited to) the following examples.</t>

                    <section title="Packet-Forwarding Rules, VLANs, and Subnets">
            <t>Packet-forwarding rules can be used to eliminate some extraneous
               streaming traffic from reaching potentially low&nbhy;powered
               sink devices; however, there may be other types of broadcast traffic that should be
                eliminated via other means -- for example, VLANs or IP subnets.</t>
                    </section>

                    <section title="Multicast Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6)">
            <t>Multicast addressing is commonly used to keep bandwidth utilization of
                shared links to a minimum.</t>

            <t>Because Layer 2 bridges by design forward Media Access Control
            (MAC) addresses, it is important that a multicast MAC address
only be associated with one
                stream. This will prevent reservations from forwarding packets from one
                stream down a path that has no interested sinks simply because there is
                another stream on that same path that shares the same multicast MAC
                address.</t>

            <t>In other words, since each multicast MAC address can represent 32 different IPv4
                multicast addresses, there must be a process in place to make sure
                that any given multicast MAC address is only associated with
                exactly one IPv4 multicast address. Requiring the use of IPv6
                addresses could help in this regard, due to the much larger
                address range of IPv6; however, due to the continued prevalence of
IPv4 installations, solutions that are effective
                for IPv4 installations would be practical in many more use cases.</t>

                <section title="Latency Optimization by a Central Controller">
                    <t>A central network controller might also perform optimizations based on the
            individual path delays; for example, sinks that are closer to the source can
            inform the controller that they can accept greater latency, since they will
            be buffering packets to match presentation times of sinks that are
farther away. The
            controller might then move a stream reservation on a short path to a longer
            path in order to free up bandwidth for other critical streams on that short
            path. See slides&nbsp;3&nbhy;5 of <xref target="SRP_LATENCY"/>.</t>
                    <t>Additional optimization can be achieved in cases where sinks have differing
            latency requirements; for example, at a live outdoor concert, the speaker
            sinks have stricter latency requirements than the recording-hardware sinks.

                <section title="Reduced Device Costs due to Reduced Buffer Memory">
                    <t>Device costs can be reduced in a system with guaranteed reservations with a
            small bounded latency due to the reduced requirements for buffering (i.e.,
            memory) on sink devices. For example, a theme park might broadcast a live
            event across the globe via a Layer 3 protocol. In such cases, the size of the
            buffers required is defined by the worst&nbhy;case latency and
            jitter values of the worst-case segment of the end-to-end network
            path. For example, on today's open Internet, the latency is typically
            unacceptable for audio and video streaming without many seconds of
            buffering. In such scenarios, a single gateway device at the local network
            that receives the feed from the remote site would provide the expensive
            buffering required to mask the latency and jitter issues associated with
            long&nbhy;distance delivery. Sink devices in the local location would have no
            additional buffering requirements, and thus no additional costs, beyond
            those required for delivery of local content. The sink device would be
            receiving packets identical to those sent by the source and would be
            unaware of any latency or jitter issues along the path.</t>

            <section title="Use Case Description">
                <t> Many systems that an electrical utility deploys today rely on high availability
                    and deterministic behavior of the underlying networks. Presented here are use
                    cases for transmission, generation, and distribution, including key timing and
                    reliability metrics. In addition, security issues and industry trends that
                    affect the architecture of next-generation utility networks are discussed.</t>

                <section title="Transmission Use Cases">
                    <section title="Protection">
            <t>"Protection" means not only the protection of human operators but also the
                protection of the electrical equipment and the preservation of the
                stability and frequency of the grid. If a fault occurs in the
                transmission or distribution of electricity, then severe damage can occur
                to human operators, electrical equipment, and the grid itself, leading to
                blackouts. </t>
            <t> Communication links, in conjunction with protection relays, are used to
                selectively isolate faults on high-voltage lines, transformers, reactors,
                and other important electrical equipment. The role of the teleprotection
                system is to selectively disconnect a faulty part by transferring
                command signals within the shortest possible time.</t>
            <section title="Key Criteria">
                <t>The key criteria for measuring teleprotection performance are command
                    transmission time, dependability, and security. These criteria are
                    defined by International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
                    Standard&nbsp;60834 <xref target="IEC-60834"/> as follows:</t>
                <t>
                    <list style="symbols">
            <t>Transmission time (speed): The time between the moment when
                a state change occurs at the transmitter input and the moment
                of the corresponding change at the receiver output, including
                propagation delay. The overall operating time for a
                teleprotection system is the sum of (1)&nbsp;the time
                required to initiate the command at the transmitting end,
                (2)&nbsp;the propagation delay over the network (including
                equipment), and (3)&nbsp;the time required to make the
                necessary selections and decisions at the receiving end, including any additional delay due to a
                noisy environment.</t>
            <t>Dependability: The ability to issue and receive valid
                commands in the presence of interference and/or noise, by
                minimizing the Probability of Missing Commands (PMC).
                Dependability targets are typically set for a specific
                Bit Error Rate (BER) level. </t>
            <t>Security: The ability to prevent false tripping due to a
                noisy environment, by minimizing the Probability of Unwanted
                Commands (PUC). Security targets are also set for a specific

            <section title="Fault Detection and Clearance Timing">
                <t> Most power-line equipment can tolerate short circuits or faults for
                    up to approximately five power cycles before sustaining irreversible
                    damage or affecting other segments in the network. This translates
                    to a total fault clearance time of 100&nbsp;ms. As a safety precaution,
                    however, the actual operation time of protection systems is limited to
                    70&nbhy;80% of this period, including fault recognition time,
                    command transmission time, and line breaker switching time. </t>
                <t>Some system components, such as large electromechanical switches,
                    require a particularly long time to operate and take up the majority
                    of the total clearance time, leaving only a 10&nbsp;ms window for the
                    telecommunications part of the protection scheme, independent of the
                    distance of travel. Given the sensitivity of the issue, new networks&nbsp;impose requirements that are even more stringent:
IEC Standard&nbsp;61850&nbhy;5:2013 <xref target="IEC-61850-5:2013"/>
                    limits the transfer time for protection messages to
                    1/4-1/2 cycle or 4-8&nbsp;ms (for 60&nbsp;Hz lines) for
messages considered the most critical.</t>
            </section>

            <section title="Symmetric Channel Delay">
                <t> Teleprotection channels that are differential must be
                synchronous; this means that any delays on the transmit and receive paths must
                    match each other. Ideally, teleprotection systems support zero
                    asymmetric delay; typical legacy relays can tolerate delay
                    discrepancies of up to 750&nbsp;us.</t>
                <t> Some tools available for lowering delay variation below this
                    threshold are as follows: </t>
                <t>
                    <list style="symbols">
            <t>For legacy systems using Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM),
                jitter buffers at the multiplexers on each end of the line
                can be used to offset delay variation by queuing sent and
                received packets. The length of the queues must balance the
                need to regulate the rate of transmission with the need to
                limit overall delay, as larger buffers result in increased
                latency. </t>
            <t>For jitter-prone IP networks, traffic management tools
                can ensure that the teleprotection signals receive the
                highest transmission priority to minimize jitter. </t>

                <xref target="IEEE-1588"/> and synchronous Ethernet
                (syncE) <xref target="syncE"/>, can help keep networks stable by

            <section title="Current Differential Protection Scheme">
                <t>Current differential protection is commonly used for line protection
                   and is typically used to protect parallel circuits. At both ends of the
                   lines, the current is measured by the differential relays; both
                   relays will trip the circuit breaker if the current going into the
                   line does not equal the current going out of the line. This type of
                   protection scheme assumes that some form of communication is present
                   between the relays at both ends of the line, to allow both relays to
                   compare measured current values. Line differential protection
                   schemes assume that the telecommunications delay between both
                   relays is very low -- often as low as 5&nbsp;ms. Moreover, as those systems are often
                   not time-synchronized, they also assume that the delay over symmetric telecommunications
                   paths is constant; this allows the comparison of current
                   measurement values taken at exactly the same time.</t>

                <t>This use case describes the exchange of sampled values
                   and/or GOOSE (Generic Object Oriented Substation Events) messages between
                   Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) in two substations for
                   protection and tripping coordination. The two IEDs are in
                   master&nbhy;slave mode. </t>

                <t>The Current Transformer or Voltage Transformer (CT/VT) in one
                   substation sends the sampled analog voltage or current value to the
                   Merging Unit (MU) over hard wire. The MU sends the

IEC&nbsp;61850&nbhy;9&nbhy;2:2011 <xref target="IEC-61850-9-2:2011"/>) to the slave IED. The slave IED forwards
                   the information to the master IED in the other substation. The
                   master IED makes the determination (for example, based on sampled
                   value differentials) to send a trip command to the originating IED.
                   Once the slave IED/relay receives the GOOSE message
                   containing the command to trip the breaker, it opens the breaker. It then sends a confirmation message
                   back to the master. All data exchanges between IEDs are
                   through sampled values and/or GOOSE messages. </t>

            <t>This use case describes the data flow from the CT/VT to the IEDs in the

1PPS (One&nbsp;Pulse Per Second) is an electrical signal that has a width of
less than 1&nbsp;second and a sharply rising or abruptly falling edge that
accurately repeats once per second. &nbsp;1PPS signals are output by radio beacons,
frequency standards, other types of precision oscillators, and some GPS
receivers. IRIG (Inter-Range Instrumentation Group) time codes are standard
formats for transferring timing information. Atomic frequency standards and
GPS receivers designed for precision timing are often equipped with an IRIG
output. Process bus communication using IEC&nbsp;61850&nbhy;9&nbhy;2:2011
<xref target="IEC-61850-9-2:2011"/> simplifies connectivity within the
                substation, removes the requirement for multiple serial connections,
                and removes the slow serial-bus architectures that are typically used.
                This also ensures increased flexibility and increased speed with the use
                of multicast messaging between multiple devices. </t>

            <t>The application of synchrophasor measurement data from Phasor Measurement
               Units (PMUs) to wide-area monitoring and control systems promises to
               provide important new capabilities for improving system stability.
               Access to PMU data enables more-timely situational awareness over larger
               portions of the grid than what has been possible historically with
                normal SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) data. Handling
                the volume and the real-time nature of synchrophasor data presents unique
                challenges for existing application architectures. The Wide-Area Management
                System (WAMS) makes it possible for the condition of the bulk power
                system to be observed and understood in real&nbsp;time so that protective,
                preventative, or corrective action can be taken. Because of the very
                high sampling rate of measurements and the strict requirement for time
                synchronization of the samples, the WAMS has stringent telecommunications
                requirements in an IP network, as captured in

            <section title="Intra-domain Network Considerations">
                <t> A wind turbine is composed of a large set of subsystems, including
                    sensors and actuators that require time-critical operation. The
                    reliability and latency constraints of these different subsystems are
                    shown in <xref target="tab_winturb2"/>. These subsystems are
                    connected to an intra-domain network that is used to monitor and
                    control the operation of the turbine and connect it to the SCADA
                    subsystems. The different components are interconnected using fiber
                    optics, industrial buses, industrial Ethernet, EtherCAT
<xref target="EtherCAT"/>, or a
                    combination thereof. Industrial signaling and control protocols such
                    as Modbus <xref target="MODBUS"/>, PROFIBUS <xref
                    target="PROFIBUS"/>, PROFINET <xref target="PROFINET"/>, and EtherCAT are used directly on top
                    of the Layer 2 transport or encapsulated over TCP/IP.</t>

                <t> The data collected from the sensors and condition-monitoring systems
                    is multiplexed onto fiber cables for transmission to the base of the
                    tower and to remote control centers.


 The turbine controller
                    continuously monitors the condition of the wind turbine and collects
                    statistics on its operation. This controller also manages a large
                    number of switches, hydraulic pumps, valves, and motors within the
                    wind turbine.</t>

                <t>There is usually a controller at the bottom of the tower
                and also in
                    the nacelle. The communication between these two controllers usually
                    takes place using fiber optics instead of copper links. Sometimes, a
                    third controller is installed in the hub of the rotor and manages
                    the pitch of the blades. That unit usually communicates with the
                    nacelle unit using serial communications.</t>
            </section>

            <section title="Inter-domain Network Considerations">
                <t> A remote control center belonging to a grid operator regulates the
                    power output, enables remote actuation, and monitors the health of
                    one or more wind parks in tandem. It connects to the local control
                    center in a wind park over the Internet (<xref
            target="fig-windturbine-internet"/>) via firewalls at both ends.
                    The Autonomous System (AS) path between the local control center and the wind park
                    typically involves several ISPs at different tiers.
 For example, a
                  remote control center in Denmark can regulate a wind park in Greece
                  over the normal public AS path between the two locations.</t>

                <t> The remote control center is part of the SCADA system, setting the
                    desired power output to the wind park and reading back the result
                    once the new power output level has been set. Traffic between the
                    remote control center and the wind park typically consists of
                    protocols like IEC 60870-5-104 <xref
                    target="IEC-60870-5-104"/>,
OPC XML-Data Access (XML-DA) <xref target="OPCXML"/>, Modbus <xref target="MODBUS"/>, and
                    SNMP <xref target="RFC3411"/>. At the time of this writing, traffic
                    flows between the remote control center and the wind park are best
                    effort. QoS requirements are not strict, so no
Service Level Agreements (SLAs) or service-provisioning mechanisms (e.g., VPNs) are employed.
 In the case of such events as equipment failure, tolerance for alarm delay is on the order of
                    minutes, due to redundant systems already in place.</t>

                <t> Future use cases will require bounded latency, bounded jitter, and
                    extraordinarily low packet loss for inter-domain traffic flows due to
                    the softwarization and virtualization of core wind-park equipment
                    (e.g., switches, firewalls, and SCADA server components). These
                    factors will create opportunities for service providers to install
                    new services and dynamically manage them from remote locations. For
                    example, to enable failover of a local SCADA server, a SCADA server
                    in another wind-park site (under the administrative control of the
                    same operator) could be utilized temporarily (<xref
            target="fig-windturbine-operatorwan"/>). In that case, local
                    traffic would be forwarded to the remote SCADA server, and existing
                    intra-domain QoS and timing parameters would have to be met for
                    inter-domain traffic flows. </t>

      <section title="Distribution Use Case">
            <section title="Fault Location, Isolation, and Service Restoration (FLISR)">
            <t>"Fault Location, Isolation, and Service Restoration (FLISR)" refers to the
                ability to automatically locate the fault, isolate the fault, and
                restore service in the distribution network. This will likely be&nbsp;the
                first widespread application of distributed intelligence in
the&nbsp;grid. </t>
            <t>The static power-switch status (open/closed) in the network dictates the
                power flow to secondary substations. Reconfiguring the network in the
                event of a fault is typically done manually on site to
                energize/de-energize alternate paths. Automating the operation of
                substation switchgear allows the flow of power to be altered
                automatically under fault conditions.</t>
            <t> FLISR can be managed centrally from a Distribution Management System
                (DMS) or executed locally through distributed control via intelligent
                switches and fault sensors. </t>

            <section title="Electrical Utilities Today">
                <t> Many utilities still rely on complex environments
consisting of multiple
                    application-specific proprietary networks, including TDM networks. </t>
                <t> In this kind of environment, there is no mixing of
Operation Technology (OT) and IT applications on the
                    same network, and information is siloed between operational areas. </t>
                <t> Specific calibration of the full chain is required; this is costly. </t>
                <t> This kind of environment prevents utility operations from
realizing operational efficiency benefits, visibility, and functional integration of
                    operational information across grid applications and data networks. </t>
                <t> In addition, there are many security-related issues, as discussed in the
                    following section.</t>

             <section title="Current Security Practices and Their Limitations">
                    <t>Grid-monitoring and control devices are already targets for cyber attacks,
            and legacy telecommunications protocols have many intrinsic
network-related vulnerabilities.
 For example, the Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3)
<xref target="IEEE-1815"/>, Modbus, PROFIBUS/PROFINET, and other
            protocols are designed around a common paradigm of "request and
            respond". Each
            protocol is designed for a master device such as an HMI (Human-Machine
            Interface) system to send commands to subordinate slave devices to
perform data retrieval (reading inputs) or control functions (writing to outputs). Because many of these
            protocols lack authentication, encryption, or other basic security measures,
            they are prone to network-based attacks, allowing a malicious actor or
            attacker to utilize the request-and-respond system as a mechanism
for functionality similar to command and control. Specific security concerns common to
            most industrial-control protocols (including utility telecommunications protocols)
            include the following: </t>
                    <t>
            <list style="symbols">
                <t>Network or transport errors (e.g., malformed packets or excessive
                    latency) can cause protocol failure.</t>
                <t>Protocol commands may be available that are capable of forcing slave
                    devices into inoperable states, including powering devices
                    off, forcing them into a listen-only state, or disabling alarming.</t>
                <t>Protocol commands may be available that are capable of
interrupting processes (e.g., restarting communications).</t>
                <t>Protocol commands may be available that are capable of clearing,
                    erasing, or resetting diagnostic information such as counters and
                    diagnostic registers.</t>
                <t>Protocol commands may be available that are capable of requesting
                    sensitive information about the controllers, their configurations,
                    or other need-to-know information.</t>
                <t>Most protocols are application-layer protocols transported
over TCP; it is therefore easy to transport commands over non-standard ports
                    or inject commands into authorized traffic flows.</t>
                <t>Protocol commands may be available that are capable of broadcasting
                    messages to many devices at once (i.e., a potential&nbsp;DoS).</t>
                <t>Protocol commands may be available that will query the device network&nbsp;to
                    obtain defined points and their values (i.e., perform a configuration
                    scan).</t>
                <t>Protocol commands may be available that will list all available
                    function codes (i.e., perform a function scan).</t>
            </list>
                    </t>
                    <t> These inherent vulnerabilities, along with increasing connectivity between
            IT and OT networks, make network-based attacks very feasible.
By injecting malicious protocol commands, an attacker could take
control over the target
            process. Altering legitimate protocol traffic can also alter information
            about a process and disrupt the legitimate controls that are in place over
            that process. A man&nbhy;in&nbhy;the&nbhy;middle attack could result in
(1)&nbsp;improper control over a process and
(2)&nbsp;misrepresentation of data that is sent back to operator consoles. </t>

            <section title="Electrical Utilities in the Future">
                <t> The business and technology trends that are sweeping the utility industry will
                    drastically transform the utility business from the way it has been for many
                    decades. At the core of many of these changes is a drive to modernize the
                    electrical grid with an integrated telecommunications infrastructure. However,
                    interoperability concerns, legacy networks, disparate tools, and stringent
                    security requirements all add complexity to the
grid's transformation. Given the
                    range and diversity of the requirements that should be addressed by the next-generation telecommunications infrastructure, utilities need to adopt a holistic
                    architectural approach to integrate the electrical grid with digital
                    telecommunications across the entire power delivery chain. </t>
                <t>The key to modernizing grid telecommunications is to provide a common, adaptable,
                    multi-service network infrastructure for the entire utility organization. Such a
                    network serves as the platform for current capabilities while enabling future
                    expansion of the network to accommodate new applications and services.</t>
                <t> To meet this diverse set of requirements both today and in
                the future, the next-generation utility telecommunications
network will be based on an
                    open-standards-based IP architecture. An end-to-end IP architecture takes
                    advantage of nearly three decades of IP technology development, facilitating
                    interoperability and device management across disparate networks and devices, as
                    has already been demonstrated in many mission-critical and highly secure
                    networks. </t>
                <t> IPv6 is seen as a future telecommunications technology for the smart grid; the
                    IEC and different national
                    committees have mandated a specific ad hoc group (AHG8) to
define the strategy for migration to IPv6 for all the
IEC Technical Committee 57 (TC&nbsp;57) power automation standards.
The AHG8 has
                    finalized its work on the migration strategy, and
                    IEC TR 62357-200:2015 <xref target="IEC-62357-200:2015"/> has been issued.</t>

                <t> Cloud-based SCADA systems will control and monitor the critical and non-critical
                    subsystems of generation systems -- for example, wind parks.</t>

                <section title="Migration to Packet-Switched Networks">
                    <t>Throughout the world, utilities are increasingly planning for a future based
            on smart-grid applications requiring advanced telecommunications systems.
            Many of these applications utilize packet connectivity for communicating
            information and control signals across the utility's WAN, made possible by technologies such as Multiprotocol Label Switching
            (MPLS). The data that traverses the utility WAN includes: <list
                style="symbols">
                <t>Grid monitoring, control, and protection data</t>
                <t>Non-control grid data (e.g., asset data for condition
                    monitoring)</t>
                <t>Data (e.g., voice and video) related to physical safety
                    and security</t>
                <t>Remote worker access to corporate applications (voice, maps,
                    schematics, etc.)</t>

                <t>Distribution-grid management</t>

                    applications)</t>
            </list> WANs support this wide variety of traffic to and from substations,
            the transmission and distribution grid, and generation sites; between control
            centers; and between work locations and data centers. To maintain this
            rapidly expanding set of applications, many utilities are taking steps to
            evolve present TDM-based and frame relay
            infrastructures to packet systems. Packet-based networks are designed to
            provide greater functionalities and higher levels of service for
            applications, while continuing to deliver reliability and deterministic
            (real-time) traffic support. </t>

                    <section title="Specific Network Topologies of Smart-Grid Applications">
            <t>Utilities often have very large private telecommunications
networks that can cover an entire territory/country. Until now, the main purposes
of these networks have been to (1)&nbsp;support transmission network
monitoring, control, and automation, (2)&nbsp;support remote control of
generation sites, and (3)&nbsp;provide FCAPS (Fault, Configuration,
Accounting, Performance, and Security) services from centralized network operation
centers.</t>
            <t> Going forward, one network will support the operation and maintenance of
                electrical networks (generation, transmission, and distribution), voice
                and data services for tens of thousands of employees and for exchanges
                with neighboring interconnections, and administrative services. To meet
                those requirements, a utility may deploy several physical networks
                leveraging different technologies across the country -- for
instance, an optical network and a microwave network. Each protection and automation
                system between two points has two telecommunications circuits, one on
                each network. Path diversity between two substations is key. Regardless
                of the event type (hurricane, ice storm, etc.), one path needs to stay
                available so the system can still operate.</t>
            <t>In the optical network, signals are transmitted over more than tens of
                thousands of circuits using fiber optic links, microwave links, and telephone
                cables. This network is the nervous system of the utility's power
                transmission operations. The optical network represents tens of thousands
                of kilometers of cable deployed along the power lines, with individual runs as
                long as 280 km.</t>

                    <section title="Precision Time Protocol">
            <t>Some utilities do not use GPS clocks in generation substations. One of
                the main reasons is that some of the generation plants are 30 to 50
                meters deep underground and the GPS signal can be weak and unreliable.
                Instead, atomic clocks are used. Clocks are synchronized amongst each
                other. Rubidium clocks provide clock and 1&nbsp;ms timestamps for IRIG-B. </t>
            <t> Some companies plan to transition to PTP
<xref target="IEEE-1588"/>, distributing the synchronization signal
                over the IP/MPLS network. PTP provides a mechanism for synchronizing the
                clocks of participating nodes to a high degree of accuracy and
                precision. </t>
            <t>PTP operates based on the following assumptions: </t>
            <t>
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>The network eliminates cyclic forwarding of
            PTP messages within each communication path (e.g., by using a
            spanning tree protocol). </t>
                    <t>PTP is tolerant of an occasional missed message, duplicated
            message, or message that arrived out of order. However, PTP
            assumes that such impairments are relatively rare. </t>
                <t>As designed, PTP expects a multicast communication model;
            however, PTP also supports a unicast communication model as long
            as the behavior of the protocol is preserved. </t>
                    <t>Like all message-based time transfer protocols, PTP time accuracy
            is degraded by delay asymmetry in the paths taken by event
            messages. PTP cannot detect asymmetry, but if such delays are
            known a&nbsp;priori, time values can be adjusted to correct for asymmetry. </t>

            increase the vulnerability of the grid to attack. Top security concerns for

            systems, it is imperative to understand the various impacts of these new
            components under a variety of attack situations on the power grid.
            The consequences of a cyber attack on the grid telecommunications network can be
            catastrophic. This is why security for the smart grid is not just an ad hoc
            feature or product; it's a complete framework integrating both physical and
            cybersecurity requirements and covering the entire smart-grid networks from
            generation to distribution. Security has therefore become one of the main
            foundations of the utility telecom network architecture and must be
            considered at every layer with a defense-in-depth approach. Migrating to IP-based protocols is key to addressing these challenges for two reasons:</t>
                    <t>
            <list style="symbols">
                <t>IP enables a rich set of features and capabilities to enhance the
                    security posture.</t>
                <t>IP is based on open standards; this allows interoperability between
                    different vendors and products, driving down the costs associated
                    with implementing security solutions in OT networks. </t>
            </list>
                    </t>
                    <t> Securing OT telecommunications over packet-switched
            IP networks follows the same principles that are foundational for securing
            the IT infrastructure, i.e., consideration must be given to
(1)&nbsp;enforcing electronic access control for both person-to-machine and
machine-to-machine communications and (2)&nbsp;providing the appropriate
levels of data privacy, device and platform integrity, and
threat detection and mitigation. </t>

      </figure>

                    <t>There are typically two layers of a network in a
            BAS. The upper layer is called
            the management network, and the lower layer is called the field network. In
            management networks, an IP-based communication protocol is used, while in
            field networks, non-IP-based communication protocols ("field protocols") are
            mainly used. Field networks have specific timing requirements, whereas
            management networks can be best effort.</t>

                    <t> An HMI is typically a desktop PC used by operators
            to monitor and display device states, send device control commands to Local
            Controllers (LCs), and configure building schedules (for example, "turn off
            all room lights in the building at 10:00 PM"). </t>

                    <t>A building management server (BMS) performs the
                    following operations.
                <list style="symbols">
                <t> Collects and stores device states from LCs at regular intervals. </t>
                <t> Sends control values to LCs according to a building schedule. </t>
                <t> Sends an alarm signal to operators if it detects abnormal device
                    states.</t>
            </list>
                    </t>
                    <t> The BMS and HMI communicate with LCs via IP-based "management protocols"
            (see standards <xref target="BACnet-IP"/> and <xref target="KNX"/>). </t>

                    <t> An LC is typically a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) that is connected
            to several tens or hundreds of devices using "field protocols". An LC
            performs the following kinds of operations:
 <list style="symbols">
                <t> Measures device states and provides the information to a BMS or&nbsp;HMI.</t>
                <t> Sends control values to devices, unilaterally or as part of a
                    feedback control loop.</t>
            </list>
                    </t>

                    <t>At the time of this writing, many field protocols
are in use; some are standards-based protocols, and others are proprietary (see
standards <xref target="LonTalk"/>, <xref target="MODBUS"/>, <xref
target="PROFIBUS"/>, and <xref target="FL-net"/>). The result is that BASs have multiple MAC/PHY
            modules and interfaces. This makes BASs more expensive and slower
            to develop and can result in "vendor lock&nbhy;in" with multiple types
            of management applications. </t>

                    <t> Each LC is connected to the monitoring room via the management network, and
            the management functions are performed within the building. In most cases,
            Fast Ethernet (e.g., 100BASE-T) is used for the management network. Since the
            management network is not a real&nbhy;time network, the use of Ethernet without QoS is sufficient for today's deployments.</t>

                    <t>Many physical interfaces used in field networks have
                    specific timing requirements -- for example,
RS232C and RS485. Thus, if a field
            network is to be replaced with an Ethernet or wireless network, such
            networks must support time-critical deterministic flows. </t>

                <section title="Use Cases for Field Networks">
                    <t> Below are use cases for environmental monitoring, fire detection, and
            feedback control, and their implications for field network performance. </t>

                    <section title="Environmental Monitoring">
            <t> The BMS polls each LC at a maximum measurement interval of
100&nbsp;ms (for example, to draw a historical chart of 1&nbhy;second granularity with a 10x
                sampling interval) and then performs the operations as specified by the
                operator. Each LC needs to measure each of its several hundred sensors
                once per measurement interval. Latency is not critical in this scenario
                as long as all sensor value measurements are completed
within the measurement
                interval. Availability is expected to be 99.999%.</t>
                    </section>

                    <section title="Fire Detection">
            <t> On detection of a fire, the BMS must stop the HVAC, close the fire
                shutters, turn on the fire sprinklers, send an alarm, etc. 
                There are typically tens of fire sensors per LC
                that the BMS needs to manage. In this
                scenario, the measurement interval is 10&nbhy;50&nbsp;ms, the communication delay is
                10&nbsp;ms, and the availability must be 99.9999%. </t>
                    </section>

                    <section title="Feedback Control">
            <t> BASs utilize feedback control in various ways; the most
                time-critical is control of DC motors, which require a short feedback
                interval (1-5&nbsp;ms) with low communication delay (10&nbsp;ms) and jitter (1&nbsp;ms).
                The feedback interval depends on the characteristics of the
device and on the requirements for the control values. There are typically
tens of feedback sensors per LC.</t>

            <t> Communication delay is expected to be less than 10&nbsp;ms
and jitter less than 1&nbsp;ms, while the availability must be 99.9999%.</t>

                </section>

                <section title="BAS Security Considerations">
                    <t> When BAS field networks were developed, it was assumed that the field
            networks would always be physically isolated from external
networks; therefore, security was not a concern. In today's world, many BASs are managed
            remotely and are thus connected to shared IP networks; 
therefore, security is a definite concern.  Note, however, that security
features are not currently available in the majority of BAS field network deployments.</t>
                    <t> The management network, being an IP-based network, has the protocols
            available to enable network security, but in practice many BASs do
            not implement even such available security features as device
            authentication or encryption for data in transit.</t>
                </section>

            </section>

            <section title="BASs in the Future">
                <t> In the future, lower energy consumption and
environmental monitoring that is more fine-grained will emerge; these will require more sensors and devices, thus
                    requiring larger and more-complex building networks. </t>
                <t> Building networks will be connected to or converged with other networks
                    (enterprise networks, home networks, and the Internet). </t>
                <t> Therefore, better facilities for network management, control, reliability, and
                    security are critical in order to improve resident and operator convenience and
                    comfort. For example, the ability to monitor and control building devices via the
                    Internet would enable (for example) control of room lights or HVAC from a
                    resident's desktop PC or phone application. </t>

            <section title="Use Case Description">
                <t> Wireless networks are useful for industrial applications
                -- for example, (1)&nbsp;when
                    portable, fast-moving, or rotating objects are involved
and (2)&nbsp;for the
                    resource-constrained devices found in the Internet of Things (IoT).</t>

                <t> Such network-connected sensors, actuators, control loops,
etc. typically
                    require that the underlying network support real-time QoS,
                    as well as such specific network properties as reliability,
                    redundancy, and security.</t>

                <t> These networks may also contain very large numbers of
                devices -- for example, for
                    factories, "big data" acquisition, and the IoT. Given the large numbers of
                    devices installed and the potential pervasiveness of the IoT, this is a huge
                    and very cost-sensitive market such that small cost reductions can save large
                    amounts of money. </t>

                <section title="Network Convergence Using 6TiSCH">
                    <t> Some wireless network technologies support real-time QoS and are thus
            useful for these kinds of networks, but others do not. </t>

                    <t> This use case focuses on one specific wireless network technology that
            provides the required deterministic QoS: "IPv6 over the TSCH mode
            of IEEE 802.15.4e" (6TiSCH, where "TSCH" stands for "Time&nbhy;Slotted
            Channel Hopping"; see <xref target="Arch-for-6TiSCH"/>, <xref
                target="IEEE-802154"/>, and <xref target="RFC7554"/>). </t>

            <t> There are other deterministic wireless buses and networks
            available today; however, they are incompatible with each other and  with IP
            traffic (for example, see <xref target="ISA100"/> and <xref target="WirelessHART"/>). </t>

                    <t>Thus, the primary goal of this use case is to apply 6TiSCH as a converged IP-based and standards-based wireless network for industrial applications, i.e., to
            replace multiple proprietary and/or incompatible wireless networking and
            wireless network management standards.</t>
                </section>

                <section title="Common Protocol Development for 6TiSCH">
                    <t> Today, there are a number of protocols required by 6TiSCH that are still in
            development.  Another goal of this use case is to highlight the ways
            in which these "missing" protocols share goals in common with DetNet. Thus,
            it is possible that some of the protocol technology developed for DetNet
            will also be applicable to 6TiSCH. </t>
                    <t> These protocol goals are identified here, along with their relationship to
            DetNet. It is likely that ultimately the resulting protocols will not be
            identical but will share design principles that contribute to the
            efficiency of enabling both DetNet and 6TiSCH.</t>
                    <t>One such commonality is that -- although on a different
                    time scale -- in both TSN <xref target="IEEE-8021TSNTG"/>
                    and TSCH, a packet that crosses the network from node to node
                    follows a precise schedule, as does a train that leaves
                    intermediate stations at precise times along its
                    path. This kind of operation reduces collisions, saves
                    energy, and enables engineering of the network for
                    deterministic properties. </t>

                    <t> Another commonality is remote monitoring and scheduling management of a TSCH
            network by a Path Computation Element (PCE) and Network Management Entity
            (NME). The PCE and NME manage timeslots and device resources in a manner that
            minimizes the interaction with, and the load placed on, resource-constrained
            devices. For example, a tiny IoT device may have just enough buffers to
            store one or a few IPv6 packets; it will have limited bandwidth between
            peers such that it can maintain only a small amount of peer
            information, and it
            will not be able to store many packets waiting to be forwarded. It is
            advantageous, then, for the IoT device to only be required to carry out the specific
            behavior assigned to it by the PCE and NME (as opposed to maintaining its own IP
            stack, for example). </t>
                    <t>It is possible that there will be some peer-to-peer communication; for
            example, the PCE may communicate only indirectly with some devices in order
            to enable hierarchical configuration of the system.</t>
                    <t> 6TiSCH depends on <xref target="PCE"/> and <xref
                target="DetNet-Arch"/>. </t>
                    <t> 6TiSCH also depends on the fact that DetNet will maintain consistency with
                <xref target="IEEE-8021TSNTG"/>.</t>

                    <t> The backbone router must ensure end-to-end deterministic behavior between
            the LLN and the backbone. This should be accomplished in conformance with
            the work done in <xref target="DetNet-Arch"/> with respect
            to Layer&nbsp;3 aspects of deterministic networks that span multiple Layer&nbsp;2
            domains. </t>

                    <t> The PCE must compute a deterministic path end to end across the TSCH network
            and IEEE&nbsp;802.1 TSN Ethernet backbone, and DetNet protocols are expected to
            enable end-to-end deterministic forwarding. </t>

                    <section title="PCE and 6TiSCH ARQ Retries">
            <t> 6TiSCH uses the Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) mechanism
<xref target="IEEE-802154"/> to
                provide higher reliability of packet delivery. ARQ is related to Packet
                Replication and Elimination (PRE) because there are two independent paths for
                packets to arrive at the destination. If an expected packet does not
                arrive on one path, then it checks for the packet on the second path. </t>
            <t> Although to date this mechanism is only used by wireless
            networks, this technique might be appropriate for DetNet, and aspects
                of the enabling protocol could therefore be co-developed. </t>

            <t> For example, in <xref target="wi_fig3"/>, a track is laid out from a
                field device in a 6TiSCH network to an IoT gateway that is located on an
                IEEE&nbsp;802.1 TSN backbone. </t>

            <t> In ARQ, the replication function in the field device sends a copy of each
                packet over two different branches, and the PCE schedules each hop of
                both branches so that the two copies arrive in due time at the gateway.
                In the case of a loss on one branch, one hopes that the other
                copy of the packet will still arrive within the allocated time. If two copies make it to the
                IoT gateway, the elimination function in the gateway ignores the extra
                packet and presents only one copy to upper layers. </t>
            <t> At each 6TiSCH hop along the track, the PCE may schedule more than one
                timeslot for a packet, so as to support Layer&nbsp;2 retries (ARQ). </t>
            <t>At the time of this writing, a deployment's TSCH track does not
                necessarily support PRE but is systematically multipath. This means
                that a track is scheduled so as to ensure that each hop has at least two
                forwarding solutions. The forwarding decision will be to try
 the preferred solution and use the other solution in the case of Layer&nbsp;2 transmission failure
                as detected by ARQ. </t>

                <section title="Schedule Management by a PCE">
                    <t> A common feature of 6TiSCH and DetNet is actions
taken by a PCE when configuring
            paths through the network. Specifically, what is needed is a protocol and
            data model that the PCE will use to get/set the relevant configuration
            from/to the devices, as well as perform operations on the devices.
 Specifically, both DetNet and 6TiSCH need to develop a protocol (and
 associated data model) that the PCE can use to
(1)&nbsp;get/set the relevant configuration from/to the devices and
(2)&nbsp;perform operations on the devices.
These could be initially developed by DetNet, with consideration for their
reuse by 6TiSCH.
 The remainder of this section provides a bit more context from the
            6TiSCH side.</t>
                    <section title="PCE Commands and 6TiSCH CoAP Requests">
            <t> The 6TiSCH device does not expect to place the request for bandwidth
                between itself and another device in the network. Rather, an operation
                control system invoked through a human interface specifies the 
                traffic requirements and the end nodes (in terms of latency and
                reliability). Based on this information, the PCE must compute a path
                between the end nodes and provision the network with per-flow state that
                describes the per-hop operation for a given packet, the corresponding
                timeslots, the flow identification that enables recognizing
            that a certain packet belongs to a certain path,&nbsp;etc.</t>
            <t> For a static configuration that serves a certain purpose for a long
                period of time, it is expected that a node will be provisioned in one
                shot with a full schedule, i.e., a schedule that defines the
                behavior of the node with respect to all data flows through
                that node. 6TiSCH expects that the programming of the
               schedule will be done over the Constrained Application
               Protocol (CoAP) as discussed in <xref target="CoAP-6TiSCH"/>.</t>
            <t> 6TiSCH expects that the PCE commands will be mapped back and forth into
                CoAP by a gateway function at the edge of the 6TiSCH network. For
                instance, it is possible that a mapping entity on the backbone
                transforms a non-CoAP protocol such as the
Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) into the RESTful interfaces
                that the 6TiSCH devices support. This architecture will be refined to
                comply with <xref target="DetNet-Arch">DetNet</xref>
                when the work is formalized. Related information about 6TiSCH can be
                found in <xref target="Interface-6TiSCH-6top"/> and
 <xref target="RFC6550"/> ("RPL: IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks").</t>
            <t> A protocol may be used to update the state in the devices during
                runtime -- for example, if it appears that a path through the network has
                ceased to perform as expected, but in 6TiSCH that flow was not designed
                and no protocol was selected. DetNet should define the appropriate
                end-to-end protocols to be used in that case. The implication is that
                these state updates take place once the system is configured and
                running, i.e., they are not limited to the initial communication of the
                configuration of the system. </t>
            <t> A "slotFrame" is the base object that a PCE would manipulate to program
                a schedule into an LLN node <xref target="Arch-for-6TiSCH"/>.</t>
            <t> The PCE should read energy data from devices and compute paths that will
                implement policies on how energy in devices is consumed -- for instance, to
                ensure that the spent energy does not exceed the available energy over
                a period of time. Note that this statement implies that an extensible
                protocol for communicating device information to the PCE and enabling the PCE
                to act on it will be part of the DetNet architecture; however, for
                subnets with specific protocols (e.g., CoAP), a gateway may be
                required.</t>
            <t> 6TiSCH devices can discover their neighbors over the radio using a
                mechanism such as beacons, but even though the neighbor information is
                available in the 6TiSCH interface data model, 6TiSCH does not describe a
                protocol to proactively push the neighbor information to a PCE.
                DetNet should define such a protocol; one possible design alternative is
                that it could operate over CoAP. Alternatively, it could be converted
                to/from CoAP by a gateway. Such a protocol could carry
                multiple metrics -- for example, metrics similar to those used for RPL operations <xref

 The "Midhaul" is the network that interconnects

                <section title="Delay Constraints" anchor="DelayConstraints">

                    <t> The available processing time for Fronthaul networking overhead is limited
            to the available time after the baseband processing of the radio frame has
            completed. For example, in Long Term Evolution (LTE) radio,
3&nbsp;ms is allocated for the processing of a radio frame, but typically the
baseband processing uses most of it, allowing only a small fraction to be
used by the Fronthaul network. In this example, out of 3&nbsp;ms, the maximum
time allocated to the Fronthaul network for one&nbhy;way delay is
250&nbsp;us, and the existing specification <xref target="NGMN-Fronth"/>
specifies a maximum delay of only 100&nbsp;us. This ultimately determines the
            distance the RRHs can be located from the base stations (e.g.,
            100&nbsp;us equals roughly 20&nbsp;km of optical fiber-based transport). Allocation
            options regarding the available time budget between processing and
            transport are currently undergoing heavy discussion in the mobile industry. </t>

       <t>For packet-based transport, the allocated transport time
    between the RRH and the BBU is consumed by
    node processing, buffering, and distance-incurred delay. An
    example of the allocated transport time is 100&nbsp;us (from the Common
    Public Radio Interface <xref target="CPRI"/>).</t>

                    <t> The baseband processing time and the available "delay budget" for the
            Fronthaul is likely to change in the forthcoming "5G" due to reduced radio
            round-trip times and other architectural and service requirements <xref
                target="NGMN"/>. </t>

                    <t> The transport time budget, as noted above, places limitations on the
            distance that RRHs can be located from base stations (i.e., the
            link length). In the above analysis, it is assumed that the entire transport time budget is available for link propagation delay. However, the transport
            time budget can be broken down into three components: scheduling/queuing
            delay, transmission delay, and link propagation delay. Using today's
            Fronthaul networking technology, the queuing, scheduling, and transmission
            components might become the dominant factors in the total transport time,
            rather than the link propagation delay. This is especially true in cases
            where the Fronthaul link is relatively short and is shared among multiple
            Fronthaul flows -- for example, in indoor and small&nbhy;cell networks,
            massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)
            antenna networks, and split Fronthaul architectures.</t>

                    <t>DetNet technology can improve Fronthaul networks by controlling and reducing
            the time required for the queuing, scheduling, and transmission operations by
            properly assigning network resources, thus (1)&nbsp;leaving more of the transport
            time budget available for link propagation and (2)&nbsp;enabling longer link
            lengths. However, link length is usually a predetermined parameter and is not a
            controllable network parameter, since RRH and
BBU sites are usually located
            in predetermined locations. However, the number of antennas in an RRH site
            might increase -- for example, by adding more antennas, increasing the MIMO
            capability of the network, or adding support for massive MIMO.
 This means increasing
            the number of Fronthaul flows sharing the same Fronthaul link. DetNet
            can now control the bandwidth assignment of the Fronthaul link and the
            scheduling of Fronthaul packets over this link and can provide adequate buffer
            provisioning for each flow to reduce the packet loss rate. </t>

                    <t>Another way in which DetNet technology can aid
 Fronthaul networks is by providing effective isolation between flows --
 for example, between flows originating in different slices within a network-sliced 5G network. Note,
 however, that this isolation applies to DetNet flows for which
resources have been preallocated, i.e., it does not apply to best-effort flows
within a DetNet. DetNet technology can also dynamically control the
            bandwidth-assignment, scheduling, and packet-forwarding decisions,
            as well as the
            buffer provisioning of the Fronthaul flows to guarantee the end-to-end delay
            of the Fronthaul packets and minimize the packet loss rate.</t>

                    <t><xref target="METIS"/> documents the fundamental challenges as well as
            overall technical goals of the future 5G mobile and wireless systems as the
            starting point. These future systems should support much higher data volumes
            and rates and significantly lower end-to-end latency for 100x more connected
            devices (at cost and energy-consumption levels similar to today's
            systems).</t>

                    <t>For Midhaul connections, delay constraints are driven by inter-site radio
            functions such as Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) processing (see <xref
                target="CoMP"/>). CoMP reception and transmission constitute a framework in
            which multiple geographically distributed antenna nodes cooperate to improve
            performance for the users served in the common cooperation area. The
            design principle of CoMP is to extend single-cell-to-multi-UE (User
            Equipment) transmission to a multi-cell-to-multi-UE transmission
via cooperation among base stations. </t>

                    <t> CoMP has delay-sensitive performance parameters: "Midhaul latency"
            and "CSI (Channel State Information) reporting and accuracy". The essential
            feature of CoMP is signaling between eNBs, so Midhaul latency is the
            dominating limitation of CoMP performance. Generally, CoMP can benefit from
            coordinated scheduling (either distributed or centralized) of different
            cells if the signaling delay between eNBs is within 1-10&nbsp;ms. This delay
            requirement is both rigid and absolute, because any uncertainty in delay will
            degrade performance significantly. </t>

                    <t> Inter-site CoMP is one of the key requirements for 5G and is also a goal for
            4.5G network architectures.</t>

                    +-16&nbsp;ns. The value is this low in order to meet the 3GPP Timing Alignment

                    (e.g., the hardware) will provide sufficient support (e.g., buffering)
                    to enable this level of accuracy. These values are maintained in the

                    reserved for the radio interface. Note that the
                    transport link contributes to radio frequency errors
for the following reason: at the time of this writing, Fronthaul communication
is direct communication from the radio unit to the RRH. The RRH is
                    essentially a passive device (e.g., without buffering). The transport
                    drives the antenna directly by feeding it with samples, and
                    everything the transport adds will be introduced to the radio "as&nbsp;is". So,
                    if the transport causes any additional frequency errors,
                    the errors will show up immediately on the radio as
		    well. Note that performance guarantees of
                    low&nbhy;nanosecond values such as these are considered to be below the
                    DetNet layer -- it is assumed that the underlying implementation

            </list></t>

                    <t> The above-listed time-synchronization requirements are difficult to meet
            with point-to-point connected networks and are more difficult to meet when the network
            includes multiple hops. It is expected that networks must include buffering
            at the ends of the connections as imposed by the jitter requirements, since
            trying to meet the jitter requirements in every intermediate node is likely
            to be too costly. However, every measure to reduce jitter and delay on the
            path makes it easier to meet the end-to-end requirements. </t>

                    <t> In order to meet the timing requirements, both senders and receivers must
            remain time synchronized, demanding very accurate clock
            distribution -- for
            example, support for IEEE&nbsp;1588 transparent clocks or boundary clocks in every
            intermediate node. </t>

                    <t> In cellular networks from the LTE radio era onward, phase synchronization is
            needed in addition to frequency synchronization
<xref target="TS36300"/> <xref target="TS23401"/>. Time constraints are also important due to
            their impact on packet loss. If a packet is delivered too late, then the
            packet may be dropped by the host. </t>
                </section>

                <section title="Transport-Loss Constraints">

                    <t>Fronthaul and Midhaul networks assume that transport is
                    almost error&nbsp;free. Errors can
            cause a reset of the radio interfaces, in turn causing reduced
            throughput or broken radio connectivity for mobile customers. </t>

                    <t> For packetized Fronthaul and Midhaul connections, packet loss may be caused
            by BER, congestion, or network failure scenarios. Different Fronthaul
            "functional splits" are being considered by 3GPP, requiring strict Frame Loss
            Ratio (FLR) guarantees. As one example (referring to the legacy CPRI split,
            which is option 8 in 3GPP), lower&nbhy;layer splits may imply an FLR of less than
            10^-7 for data traffic and less than 10^-6 for control and management
            traffic.</t>

                    <t>Many of the tools available for eliminating packet loss for Fronthaul and
            Midhaul networks have serious challenges; for example, retransmitting lost
            packets or using FEC to circumvent bit errors
            (or both) is practically impossible, due to the additional delay incurred. Using
            redundant streams for better guarantees of delivery is also practically
            impossible in many cases, due to high bandwidth requirements for Fronthaul and
            Midhaul networks. Protection switching is also a candidate, but at the time
            of this writing, available technologies for the path switch are too slow to
            avoid a reset of mobile interfaces.</t>

                    <t>It is assumed that Fronthaul links are symmetric.
            All Fronthaul streams (i.e., those carrying radio data) have equal priority and cannot delay or preempt
            each other.</t>

<t>All of this implies that it is up to the network to guarantee that each
time&nbhy;sensitive flow meets its schedule.</t>

                    <t> Establishing time-sensitive streams in the network entails reserving

            attempts from hostile nodes (or accidental misconfiguration). This is
            particularly important in the case where the reservation requests span

                <t> Future cellular radio networks will be based on a mix of different xHaul
                    networks (xHaul = Fronthaul, Midhaul, and Backhaul), and future transport networks
                    should be able to support all of them simultaneously. It is already envisioned
                    today that:</t>
                <t>
                    <list style="symbols">
            <t> Not all "cellular radio network" traffic will be IP;
 for example, some
                will remain at Layer 2 (e.g., Ethernet based). DetNet solutions must
                address all traffic types (Layer 2 and Layer 3) with the same tools and
                allow their transport simultaneously. </t>
            <t> All types of xHaul networks will need some types of DetNet solutions. For
                example, with the advent of 5G, some Backhaul traffic will also have
                DetNet requirements (for example, traffic belonging to time-critical 5G
                applications).</t>
            <t>Different functional splits between the base stations and the
                on&nbhy;site units could coexist on the same Fronthaul and Backhaul

                    </list>
                </t>

                <t> Future cellular radio networks should contain the following:</t>
                <t>
                    <list style="symbols">
            <t> Unified standards-based transport protocols and standard networking
                equipment that can make use of underlying deterministic link-layer
                services </t>
            <t> Unified and standards-based network management systems and protocols in
                all parts of the network (including Fronthaul)</t>
                    </list>
                </t>

                <t> New RAN deployment models and architectures may require TSN services with strict requirements on other parts of the
                    network that previously were not considered to be packetized at all. Time and
                    synchronization support are already topical for Backhaul and Midhaul packet
                    networks <xref target="MEF22.1.1"/> and are also becoming a real issue for Fronthaul
                    networks. Specifically, in Fronthaul networks, the timing and synchronization
                    requirements can be extreme for packet-based technologies -- for example, on the
                    order of a PDV of +-20&nbsp;ns or less and frequency accuracy of
                    +-0.002 PPM <xref target="Fronthaul"/>.</t>

                <t> The actual transport protocols and/or solutions for establishing required transport
                    "circuits" (pinned-down paths) for Fronthaul traffic are
                    still undefined. Those protocols
                    are likely to include (but are not limited to) solutions directly over Ethernet,
                    over IP, and using MPLS&wj;/pseudowire transport. </t>

                <t> Interesting and important work for TSN has been done for
                    Ethernet <xref target="IEEE-8021TSNTG"/>; this work specifies the use
of PTP <xref target="IEEE-1588"/> in the context of IEEE 802.1D
                    and IEEE 802.1Q.
 <xref target="IEEE-8021AS"/> specifies a Layer 2 time-synchronizing service, and other specifications such as IEEE 1722 <xref
            target="IEEE-1722"/> specify Ethernet-based Layer&nbsp;2 transport for
                    time-sensitive streams. </t>

                <t> However, even these Ethernet TSN features may not be sufficient for Fronthaul
                    traffic. Therefore, having specific profiles that
                    take Fronthaul requirements into account is desirable <xref target="IEEE-8021CM"/>. </t>
                <t> New promising work seeks to enable the transport of time-sensitive Fronthaul
                    streams in Ethernet bridged networks <xref
                    target="IEEE-8021CM"/>. Analogous to IEEE&nbsp;1722,
                    standardization efforts in the IEEE&nbsp;1914.3 Task Force
                    <xref target="IEEE-19143"/> to define the Layer&nbsp;2 
                    transport encapsulation format for transporting Radio over
                    Ethernet (RoE) are ongoing.</t>

                <t>As mentioned in <xref target="DelayConstraints"/>, 5G communications will provide
                    one of the most challenging cases for delay-sensitive networking. In order to
                    meet the challenges of ultra-low latency and ultra-high throughput, 3GPP has
                    studied various functional splits for 5G, i.e., physical
decomposition of the 5G "gNodeB" base station and deployment of its functional
blocks in different locations <xref target="TR38801"/>.</t>

                <t>These splits are numbered from split option 1 (dual connectivity, a split in
                    which the radio resource control is centralized and other radio stack layers are
                    in distributed units) to split option 8 (a PHY-RF split in which RF
                    functionality is in a distributed unit and the rest of the radio stack is in the
                    centralized unit), with each intermediate split having its
                    own data-rate and
                    delay requirements. Packetized versions of different splits have been proposed,
                    including enhanced CPRI (eCPRI) <xref target="eCPRI"/> and RoE (as previously noted). Both
                    provide Ethernet encapsulations, and eCPRI is also capable of IP
                    encapsulation.</t>

                <t> All-IP RANs and xHaul networks would benefit from time synchronization and
                    time&nbhy;sensitive transport services. Although Ethernet appears to be the unifying
                    technology for the transport, there is still a disconnect
                    when it comes to providing Layer&nbsp;3
                    services. The protocol stack typically has a number of layers below Ethernet
                    Layer&nbsp;2 that might be "visible" to Layer&nbsp;3. 
In a fairly common scenario, on top of the lowest&nbhy;layer (optical) transport
is the  first (lowest) Ethernet layer, then one or more layers of MPLS,
pseudowires, and/or other tunneling protocols, and finally one or more
Ethernet layers that are visible to Layer&nbsp;3.</t>

                <t>Although there exist technologies for establishing circuits through the routed
                    and switched networks (especially in the MPLS/PWE space), there is still no way to
                    signal the time-synchronization and time&nbhy;sensitive stream
                    requirements/reservations for Layer&nbsp;3 flows in a way that addresses the entire
                    transport stack, including the Ethernet layers that need to be configured.</t>

                <t> Furthermore, not all "user-plane" traffic will be
                IP. Therefore, the solution in question also must address the
                use cases where the user&nbhy;plane traffic is on a
                    different layer (for example, Ethernet frames). </t>

                <t>"Industrial automation" in general refers to automation of manufacturing, quality
                    control, and material processing. This M2M use case
                    focuses on machine units on a plant floor that periodically exchange data with
                    upstream or downstream machine modules and/or a
                    supervisory controller within a LAN. </t>

                <t> PLCs are the "actors" in M2M communications.
                    Communication between PLCs, and between PLCs and the supervisory PLC (S&nbhy;PLC), is
                    achieved via critical control/data streams (<xref target="fig_indm2m"/>). </t>

                <t> This use case focuses on PLC-related communications; communication to
                    Manufacturing Execution Systems (MESs) are not addressed. </t>

                <t> This use case covers only critical control/data streams; non-critical traffic
                    between industrial automation applications (such as communication of state,
                    configuration, setup, and database communication) is adequately served by
                    prioritizing techniques available at the time of this writing. Such traffic can
                    use up to 80% of the total bandwidth required. There is also a subset of
                    non&nbhy;time-critical traffic that must be reliable even though it is not
                    time sensitive.</t>

                <t> In this use case, deterministic networking is primarily
needed to provide
                    end-to-end delivery of M2M messages within specific timing
                    constraints -- for
                    example, in closed-loop automation control. Today, this level of determinism is
                    provided by proprietary networking technologies. In addition, standard
                    networking technologies are used to connect the local network to remote
                    industrial automation sites, e.g., over an enterprise or metro network that also
                    carries other types of traffic. Therefore, flows that should be forwarded with
                    deterministic guarantees need to be sustained, regardless of the amount of other
                    flows in those networks.</t>

            <section title="Industrial M2M Communications Today">

                <t>Today, proprietary networks fulfill the needed timing and availability for M2M
                    networks.</t>

                <t> The network topologies used today by industrial automation are similar to those
                    used by telecom networks: daisy chain, ring, hub&nbhy;and&nbhy;spoke, and "comb" (a subset
                    of daisy chain). </t>

                <t> PLC-related control/data streams are transmitted periodically and carry either a
                    preconfigured payload or a payload configured during runtime.</t>

                <t> Some industrial applications require time synchronization at the end nodes. For
                    such time-coordinated PLCs, accuracy of 1&nbsp;us is required. Even in the
                    case of "non-time-coordinated" PLCs, time synchronization may be needed, e.g., for
                    timestamping of sensor data.</t>

                <t> Industrial-network scenarios require advanced security solutions. At the time of
                    this writing, many industrial production networks are physically separated. Filtering policies that are typically enforced in
                firewalls are used to prevent critical flows from being leaked
                outside a domain. </t>

                <section anchor="sec_m2mtr" title="Transport Parameters">

                    <t>The cycle time defines the frequency of message(s) between industrial
            actors. The cycle time is application dependent, in the range of
1&nbhy;100&nbsp;ms
            for critical control/data streams.</t>

                    <t>Because industrial applications assume that
                    deterministic transport will be used for critical
            control-data-stream parameters (instead of having to define
            latency and delay-variation parameters), it is sufficient to
            fulfill requirements regarding the upper bound of latency
            (maximum latency). The underlying networking infrastructure must ensure a
            maximum end&nbhy;to&nbhy;end message delivery time in the range of
            100&nbsp;us to 50&nbsp;ms, depending on the control-loop
            application.</t>

                    <t> The bandwidth requirements of control/data streams are usually calculated
            directly from the bytes-per-cycle parameter of the control loop. For
            PLC-to-PLC communication, one can expect 2-32 streams with packet sizes in
            the range of 100-700 bytes. For S&nbhy;PLC-to-PLC communication, the number of streams is
            higher -- up to 256 streams. Usually, no more than 20% of available bandwidth
            is used for critical control/data streams. In today's networks, 1&nbsp;Gbps links
            are commonly used.</t>

            <t> Most PLC control loops are rather tolerant of packet loss; however, critical
            control/data streams accept a loss of no more than one packet
 per consecutive
            communication cycle (i.e., if a packet gets lost in cycle "n", then the next
            cycle ("n+1") must be lossless). After 
the loss of two or more consecutive packets,
            the network may be considered to be "down" by the application.</t>

                    <t> As network downtime may impact the whole production system, the required
            network availability is rather high (99.999%).</t>

                    <t> Based on the above parameters, some form of redundancy will be required for
            M2M communications; however, any individual solution depends on several
            parameters, including cycle time and delivery time.</t>

                    <t> In an industrial environment, critical control/data streams are created
            rather infrequently, on the order of ~10 times per day&wj;/week&wj;/month. Most
            of these critical control/data streams get created at machine
            startup; however, flexibility is also needed during runtime -- for example, when adding
            or removing a machine. As production systems become more
            flexible going forward, there will be a significant increase in the rate at which streams
            are created, changed, and destroyed. </t>

            <section title="Use Case Description">

                <t>The mining industry is highly dependent on networks to monitor and control their
                    systems,
in both open&nbhy;pit and underground extraction as well as in transport and refining
                    processes. In order to reduce risks and increase operational efficiency in
    mining operations, the location of operators has been
relocated (as much as possible) from the extraction site to
remote control and monitoring sites.</t>

                <t>In the case of open-pit mining, autonomous trucks are used to transport the raw
                    materials from the open pit to the refining factory where the final product
                    (e.g., copper) is obtained. Although the operation is autonomous, the tracks are
                    remotely monitored from a central facility.</t>

                <t>In pit mines, the monitoring of the tailings or mine dumps is critical in order
                    to minimize environmental pollution. In the past, monitoring was conducted
                    through manual inspection of preinstalled
                    dataloggers. Cabling is not typically used in such
                    scenarios, due to its high cost and complex deployment requirements.
                    At the time of this writing, wireless technologies are being employed to monitor
                    these cases permanently. Slopes are also monitored in order to anticipate
                    possible mine collapse. Due to the unstable terrain, cable maintenance is costly
                    and complex; hence, wireless technologies are employed.</t>

                <t>In the case of underground monitoring, autonomous vehicles with extraction tools
                    travel independently through the tunnels, but their operational tasks (such as
                    excavation, stone-breaking, and transport) are controlled remotely from a central
                    facility. This generates
 upstream video and feedback traffic plus downstream actuator-control
 traffic.</t>
            </section>

            <section title="Mining Industry Today">
                <t>At the time of this writing, the mining industry uses a packet&nbhy;switched
                   architecture supported by high-speed Ethernet. However, in
                   order to comply with requirements regarding delay and
                   packet loss, the network bandwidth is overestimated. This
                   results in very low efficiency in terms of resource usage.</t>

                <t>QoS is implemented at the routers to separate video, management, monitoring, and process-control traffic for each stream.</t>

                <t>Since mobility is involved in this process, the connections between the backbone
                    and the mobile devices (e.g., trucks, trains, and
                    excavators) are implemented using a
                    wireless link. These links are based on
 IEEE&nbsp;802.11 <xref target="IEEE-80211"/> for open-pit mining and
 "leaky feeder" communications for underground mining.
 (A "leaky feeder" communication
                    system consists of a coaxial cable, run along tunnels, that emits and receives
                    radio waves, functioning as an extended antenna. The cable is "leaky" in that it
                    has gaps or slots in its outer conductor to allow the radio signal to leak into
                    or out of the cable along its entire length.) </t>

                <t>Lately, in pit mines the use of Low-Power WAN (LPWAN) technologies has been extended: tailings,
                    slopes, and mine dumps are monitored by battery-powered dataloggers that make use
                    of robust long&nbhy;range radio technologies. Reliability is usually ensured through
                    retransmissions at Layer&nbsp;2. Gateways or concentrators act as bridges, forwarding the
                    data to the backbone Ethernet network. Deterministic requirements are biased
                    towards reliability rather than latency, as events are
triggered slowly or can be anticipated in advance.</t>

                <t>At the mineral-processing stage, conveyor belts and
                refining processes are controlled by a SCADA system that
                provides an in&nbhy;factory delay-constrained networking environment.
</t>

                <t>At the time of this writing, voice communications are served by a redundant
                    trunking infrastructure, independent from data networks.</t>
            </section>
            <section title="Mining Industry in the Future">

                <t>Mining operations and management are converging towards a combination of
                    autonomous operation and teleoperation of transport and extraction machines.
                    This means that video, audio, monitoring, and process-control traffic will
                    increase dramatically. Ideally, all activities at the mine will rely on network
                    infrastructure.</t>

                <t>Wireless for open-pit mining is already a reality with LPWAN technologies; it
                    is expected to evolve to more-advanced LPWAN technologies, such as those based on
                    LTE, to increase last&nbhy;hop reliability or novel LPWAN flavors with deterministic
                    access.</t>

                <t>One area in which DetNet can improve this use case is in the wired networks that
                    make up the "backbone network" of the system.  These
                    networks connect many wireless Access Points (APs) together. The mobile machines (which are connected to the
                    network via wireless) transition from one AP to the next as they move about. A
                    deterministic, reliable, low&nbhy;latency backbone can enable these transitions to be
                    more reliable.</t>

                <t>Connections that extend all the way from the base stations to the machinery via
                    a mix of wired and wireless hops would also be beneficial
                    -- for example, to
                    improve the responsiveness of digging machines to
remote control. However, to guarantee
                    deterministic performance of a DetNet, the end-to-end underlying network must be
                    deterministic. Thus, for this use case, if a deterministic wireless transport is
                    integrated with a wire-based DetNet network, it could create the desired wired
                    plus wireless end-to-end deterministic network.</t>

            <section title="Use Case Description">

                <t>Blockchain was created with Bitcoin as a "public" blockchain on the open
                   Internet; however, blockchain has also spread far beyond its original host into
                    various industries, such as smart manufacturing, logistics, security, legal
                    rights, and others. In these industries, blockchain runs in designated and
                    carefully managed networks in which deterministic networking requirements could
                    be addressed by DetNet. Such implementations are referred
                to as "private" blockchain.</t>
                <t>The sole distinction between public and private blockchain is defined by who is
                    allowed to participate in the network, execute the consensus protocol, and
                    maintain the shared ledger.</t>

                <t>Today's networks manage the traffic from blockchain on a best&nbhy;effort basis, but
                    blockchain operation could be made much more efficient if deterministic
                    networking services were available to minimize latency and packet loss in the
                    network.</t>

                <section title="Blockchain Operation">

                    <t>A "block" runs as a container of a batch of primary
                    items (e.g., transactions, property records). The blocks are chained in such a way
            that the hash of the previous block works as the pointer to the header of
            the new block. Confirmation of each block requires a consensus mechanism.
            When an item arrives at a blockchain node, the latter broadcasts this item
            to the rest of the nodes, which receive it, verify it, and put it in the
            ongoing block.
 The block confirmation process begins as the number of items
            reaches the predefined block capacity, at which time the node broadcasts its
            proved block to the rest of the nodes, to be verified and chained. The
            result is that block N+1 of each chain transitively vouches for
            blocks N and previous of that chain.</t>

                <section title="Blockchain Network Architecture">

                 <t>Blockchain node communication and coordination are achieved mainly through
            frequent point-to-multipoint communication; however, persistent
            point-to-point connections are used to transport both the items and the
            blocks to the other nodes. For example, consider the following
            implementation. </t>
                    <t>When a node is initiated, it first requests the other nodes' addresses from a
            specific entity, such as DNS.  The node then creates persistent
            connections with each of the other nodes. If a node confirms an item, it sends the item to the other
            nodes via these persistent connections.</t>
                    <t>As a new block in a node is completed and is proven by the surrounding nodes,
            it propagates towards its neighbor nodes. When node A receives a block, it
            verifies it and then sends an invite message to its neighbor B. Neighbor B
            checks to see if the designated block is available and responds to A if it
            is unavailable; A then sends the complete block to B. &nbsp;B repeats the process
            (as was done by A) to start the next round of block propagation.</t>
                    <t>The challenge of blockchain network operation is not overall data rates,
            since the volume from both the block and the item stays between hundreds of bytes and
            a couple of megabytes per second; rather, the challenge is in transporting the blocks with
            minimum latency to maximize the efficiency of the blockchain consensus process.
            The efficiency of differing implementations of the consensus process may be
            affected to a differing degree by the latency (and variation of latency) of
            the network. </t>

            application level, where cryptography as well as hash-based consensus play a
            leading role in preventing both double-spending and malicious service
            attacks. However, there is concern that in the proposed use case for a

            <section title="Use Case Description">
                <t>Network slicing divides one physical network infrastructure into multiple logical
                    networks. Each slice, which corresponds to a logical network, uses resources and
                    network functions independently from each other. Network slicing provides
                    flexibility of resource allocation and service quality customization. </t>
                <t>Future services will demand network performance with a wide variety of
                    characteristics such as high data rate, low latency, low loss rate, security, and
                    many other parameters. Ideally, every service would have its own physical network
                    satisfying its particular performance requirements; however, that would be
                    prohibitively expensive. Network slicing can provide a customized slice for a
                    single service, and multiple slices can share the same physical network. This
                    method can optimize performance for the service at lower cost, and the
                    flexibility of setting up and releasing the slices also allows the user to
                    allocate network resources dynamically. </t>
                <t>Unlike the other use cases presented here, network slicing is not a specific
                    application that depends on specific deterministic properties; rather, it is
                    introduced as an area of networking to which DetNet might be applicable. </t>

                <section title="Resource Isolation across Slices">
                    <t>One of the requirements discussed for network slicing is the "hard"
            separation of various users' deterministic performance. That is, it should
            be impossible for activity, lack of activity, or changes in activity of one
            or more users to have any appreciable effect on the deterministic
            performance parameters of any other slices. Typical techniques used today,
            which share a physical network among users, do not offer this level of
            isolation. DetNet can supply point-to-point or point-to-multipoint paths
            that offer a user bandwidth and latency guarantees that cannot be
            affected by other users' data traffic.
 Thus, DetNet is a powerful tool when reliability and low

            more than one way. For example, the slice itself might be implemented using
            DetNet, and thus the slice can provide service guarantees and isolation to
            its users without any particular DetNet awareness on the part of the users'
            applications. Alternatively, a "non-DetNet-aware" slice may host an

                    a typical use case for network slicing; for example, consider three 5G service

                    Examples include providing services for electrical utilities and pro audio 
                    via slices. Use cases like these could become more common once the work for the
                    5G CN evolves to include wired as well as wireless access. </t>

            <section title="Limitations of DetNet in Network Slicing">
                <t>DetNet cannot cover every network slicing use case. One issue is that DetNet is a
                   point-to-point or point-to-multipoint technology; however, network slicing
                   ultimately needs multipoint-to-multipoint guarantees. Another issue is that
                    the number of flows that can be carried by DetNet is limited by DetNet
                    scalability; flow aggregation and queuing management modification may help
                    address this issue. Additional work and discussion are needed to address these topics.

            <section title="Network Slicing Today and in the Future">
                <t>Network slicing has promise in terms of satisfying many requirements of future network
                    deployment scenarios, but it is still a collection of ideas and analyses
                    without a specific technical solution. DetNet is one of various technologies
                    that could potentially be used in network slicing, along with, for example, Flex&nbhy;E
                    and segment routing. For more information, please see the

            <t>This section summarizes the expected properties of a DetNet network, based on the use
                cases as described in this document. </t>
            <section title="Unified, Standards-Based Networks">
                <section title="Extensions to Ethernet">
                    <t>A DetNet network is not "a new kind of network" --
 it is based on extensions to
            existing Ethernet standards, including elements of IEEE&nbsp;802.1&nbsp;TSN and
            related standards. Presumably, it will be possible to run DetNet over other
            underlying transports besides Ethernet, but Ethernet is explicitly
            supported. </t>
                </section>
                <section title="Centrally Administered Networks">
                    <t>In general, a DetNet network is not expected to be
                    "plug and play"; rather, some type of centralized network configuration and control
            system is expected. Such a system may be in a single central
            location, or it may be
            distributed across multiple control entities that function together as a
            unified control system for the network. However, the ability to "hot swap"
            components (e.g., due to malfunction) is similar enough to "plug and play"
            that this kind of behavior may be expected in DetNet networks, depending on
            the implementation. </t>

                <section title="Standardized Data-Flow Information Models">
                    <t>Data-flow information models to be used with DetNet networks are to be

                    <t>A DetNet network is intended to integrate between Layer 2 (bridged)
            network(s) (e.g., an AVB/TSN LAN) and Layer 3 (routed) network(s) (e.g., using
            IP-based protocols). One example of this is making AVB&wj;/TSN&nbhy;type
            deterministic performance available from Layer 3 applications, e.g., using
            RTP. Another example is connecting two AVB/TSN LANs ("islands") together
            through a standard router.</t>
                </section>
                <section title="IPv4 Considerations">
                  <t>This document explicitly does not specify any particular
            implementation or protocol; however, it has been observed that
            various use cases (and their associated industries) described
            herein are explicitly based
            on IPv4 (as opposed to IPv6), and it is not considered practical to expect
            such implementations to migrate to IPv6 in order to use DetNet. Thus, the expectation is that
            even if not every feature of DetNet is available in an IPv4 context, at
            least some of the significant benefits (such as guaranteed end-to-end
            delivery and low latency) will be available. </t>
                </section>
                <section title="Guaranteed End-to-End Delivery">
                    <t>Packets in a DetNet flow are guaranteed not to be dropped by the network due
            to congestion. However, the network may drop packets for intended reasons,
            e.g., per security measures. Similarly, best&nbhy;effort traffic on a DetNet is
            subject to being dropped (as on a non&nbhy;DetNet IP network). Also note that
            this guarantee applies to actions taken by DetNet protocol software and does
            not provide any guarantee against lower&nbhy;level errors such as media errors or
            checksum errors. </t>

                <section title="Replacement for Multiple Proprietary Deterministic Networks">
                    <t>There are many proprietary non-interoperable deterministic Ethernet-based
            networks available; DetNet is intended to provide an open&nbhy;standards-based
            alternative to such networks.</t>

                <section title="Mix of Deterministic and Best-Effort Traffic" anchor="mix-det-best-effort">
                    <t>DetNet is intended to support the coexistence of time-sensitive operational (OT)

                <section title="Unused Reserved Bandwidth to Be Available to Best&nbhy;Effort Traffic">
                    <t>If bandwidth reservations are made for a stream but the associated bandwidth
            is not used at any point in time, that bandwidth is made available on the
            network for best-effort traffic. If the owner of the reserved stream then
            starts transmitting again, the bandwidth is no longer available for
            best-effort traffic; this occurs on a moment&nbhy;to-moment basis. Note that such
            "temporarily available" bandwidth is not available for time-sensitive
            traffic, which must have its own reservation. </t>

                <section title="Lower-Cost, Multi-Vendor Solutions">
                 <t>The DetNet network specifications are intended to enable an ecosystem in which multiple vendors can create interoperable products, thus promoting
            device diversity and potentially higher numbers of each device manufactured,
            promoting cost reduction and cost competition among vendors.
            In other words, vendors should be able to create DetNet networks at lower cost and with
            greater diversity of available devices than existing proprietary networks.

                <t>DetNet networks range in size from very small (e.g., inside a single industrial
                    machine) to very large (e.g., a utility-grid network spanning a whole
                    country and involving many "hops" over various kinds of
                    links -- for example, radio
                    repeaters, microwave links, or fiber optic links). However, recall that the
                    scope of DetNet is confined to networks that are centrally
                    administered and thereby explicitly excludes unbounded decentralized networks such as the Internet.</t>

                <section title="Scalable Number of Flows">
                    <t>The number of flows in a given network application can potentially be large
            and can potentially grow faster than the number of nodes and hops, so the
            network should provide a sufficient (perhaps configurable) maximum number of
            flows for any given application.</t>

                    <t>DetNet data-flow information models are
expected to provide means to configure the network that include parameters for querying network path
            latency, requesting bounded latency for a given stream, requesting worst-case maximum and/or minimum latency for a given path or stream, and so on.
            It is expected that the network may not be able to provide a given
            requested service level; if this is indeed the case, the network control system should reply
            that the requested services are not available (as opposed to accepting the
            parameter but then not delivering the desired behavior).</t>

                    <t>Various applications may state that they require
 "extremely low latency"; however, depending on the application, "extremely
 low" may imply very different latency bounds. For example, "low latency"
 across a utility-grid network is a different order of magnitude of latency
 values compared to "low latency" in a motor control loop in a small
 machine. It is intended that the mechanisms for specifying desired latency
 include wide ranges and that architecturally there is nothing to prevent
 arbitrarily low latencies from being implemented in a given network.</t>

                <t>Reliability is of critical importance to many DetNet
                applications, because the consequences of failure can be extraordinarily high in terms of cost and even
                    human life. DetNet-based systems are expected to be implemented with essentially
                   arbitrarily high availability -- for&nbsp;example, 99.9999%
                   uptime (where 99.9999 means "six nines") or even 12 nines.
                   DetNet designs should&nbsp;not make any assumptions about the
                    level of reliability and availability that may be required of a given system
                    and should define parameters for communicating these kinds of metrics within the
                    network.</t>
                <t>A strategy used by DetNet for providing such extraordinarily high levels of
                    reliability is to provide redundant paths so that
                    a system can seamlessly switch between the paths
                while maintaining its required level of performance.</t>

                <t>Security is of critical importance to many DetNet applications. A DetNet network
                    must have the ability to be made secure against device failures, attackers, misbehaving
                    devices, and so on. In a DetNet network, the data traffic is expected to be time sensitive; thus, in addition to arriving with the data content as intended,
                    the data must also arrive at the expected time. This may present "new" security
                    challenges to implementers and must be addressed accordingly. There are other
                    security implications, including (but not limited to) the change in attack

        <section title="Use Cases Explicitly Out of Scope for DetNet"
              anchor="use-cases-out-of-scope">
            <t>This appendix contains text regarding use cases that have been determined to
            be outside the scope of the present DetNet work. </t>

            <section title="DetNet Scope Limitations">
             <t>The scope of DetNet is deliberately limited to specific use
             cases that are consistent with the WG charter, subject to the
             interpretation of the WG. At the time that the DetNet use cases
             were solicited and provided by the authors, the scope of DetNet
             was not clearly defined. As the scope has been clarified, certain
             use cases have been determined to be outside the scope of the
             present DetNet work. Text regarding these use cases was moved
             to this appendix to clarify that they will not be supported by
             the DetNet work.</t>

             <t>The text was moved to this appendix based on the following
             "exclusion" principles. Please note that as an alternative to
             moving all such text to this appendix some text has been modified
             in&nbsp;situ to reflect these same principles.</t>

                <t>The following principles have been established to clarify the scope of the
                    present DetNet work.</t>
                <t>
                    <list style="symbols">
            <t>The scope of networks addressed by DetNet is limited to networks that can
                be centrally controlled, i.e., an "enterprise" (aka "corporate") network.
                This explicitly excludes "the open Internet".</t>
            <t>Maintaining time synchronization across a DetNet network is crucial to its
               operation; however, DetNet assumes that time is to be maintained using
               other means. One example would be PTP <xref target="IEEE-1588"/>. A use case may state the accuracy and
                reliability that it expects from the DetNet network as part of a whole
                system; however, it is understood that such timing properties are not
                guaranteed by DetNet itself. At the time of this writing,
                two open questions remain:

                <t> There are many applications that communicate over the open Internet that could
                    benefit from guaranteed delivery and bounded latency. However, as noted above,
                    all such applications, when run over the open Internet, are out of scope for
                    DetNet. These same applications may be in scope when run in constrained
                    environments, i.e., within a centrally controlled DetNet network. The following
                    are some examples of such applications. </t>

the desired maximum allowance for round-trip delay is typically 100&nbsp;ms.

            <section title="Pro Audio and Video - Digital Rights Management (DRM)">
           <t>The following text was moved to this appendix because this 
           information is considered a link-layer topic for which DetNet
           is not directly responsible.</t>

                <t>Digital Rights Management (DRM) is very important to the audio and video
                    industries. Whenever protected content is introduced into a network, there are
                    DRM concerns that must be taken into account (see <xref target="Content_Protection"/>).
                    Many aspects of DRM are outside the scope of network technology; however, there
                    are cases when a secure link supporting authentication and encryption is
                    required by content owners to carry their audio or video content when it is
                    outside their own secure environment (for example, see <xref target="DCI"/>).</t>
                <t>As an example, two such techniques are Digital Transmission Content Protection (DTCP)
                    and High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP). HDCP content is not
                    approved for retransmission within any other type of DRM,
                    while DTCP content may be
                    retransmitted under HDCP. Therefore, if the source of a stream is outside of the
                    network and it uses HDCP, it is only allowed to be placed
                    on the network with that same type of protection
                    (i.e., HDCP).</t>
            </section>

            <section title="Pro Audio and Video - Link Aggregation">
                <t>Note: The term "link aggregation" is used here as defined by the text in the
                    following paragraph, i.e., not following a more common network-industry
                    definition. </t>
                <t>For transmitting streams that require more bandwidth than a single link in the
                    target network can support, link aggregation is a technique for combining
                    (aggregating) the bandwidth available on multiple physical links to create a
                    single logical link that provides the required bandwidth. However, if aggregation is to be
                    used, the network controller (or equivalent) must be able to determine the
                    maximum latency of any path through the aggregate link. </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Pro Audio and Video - Deterministic Time to Establish Streaming">
                <t>The DetNet WG decided that guidelines for establishing a
                   deterministic time to establish stream startup are not
                   within the scope of DetNet.
                   If the bounded timing for establishing or re&nbhy;establishing streams is required in a given
                    use case, it is up to the application/system to achieve it.</t>
