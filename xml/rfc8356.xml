   IANA assigns values to the Path Computation Element Communication 
   Protocol (PCEP) parameters (messages,
   objects, TLVs). IANA established a top-level registry to contain all PCEP
   codepoints and sub-registries.   This top-level registry contains
   sub-registries for PCEP message, object, and TLV types.  The
   allocation policy for each of these sub-registries is IETF Review. </t>
   
   <t>This document updates RFC 5440 by changing the allocation policies 
   for these three registries to mark some of the codepoints as assigned
   for Experimental Use.

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
   <t>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) <xref target="RFC5440"/> provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Client (PCC) requests.</t>

   <t>Further, in order to support use cases described in <xref target="RFC8051"/>, 
   <xref target="RFC8231"/> specifies a set of
   extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of MPLS-TE and GMPLS
   LSPs via PCEP. <xref target="RFC8281"/> describes the setup,
   maintenance, and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE
   model.</t>

   <t>In Section 9 of <xref target="RFC5440"/>, IANA assigns values to 
   the PCEP protocol parameters (messages, objects, TLVs). 
   IANA established a top-level registry to contain all PCEP codepoints and sub-registries.
   This top-level registry contains sub-registries for PCEP message,
   object and TLV types.  The allocation policy for each of these
   sub-registries is IETF Review <xref target="RFC8126"/>.

   Also, early
   allocation <xref target="RFC7120"/> provides some latitude for allocation of these
   codepoints but is reserved
   for features that are considered appropriately stable.</t> 
      
   <t>Recently, there have been rapid advancements in PCE technology, which
   has created an enhanced need to experiment with PCEP. It is often necessary
   to use some sort of number or constant in order to actually
   test or experiment with the new function, even when testing in a
   closed environment. In order to run experiments, it is important that 
   the value not collide with existing codepoints or any
   future allocations. </t>
   
   <t>This document updates <xref target="RFC5440"/> by changing the allocation policies
    for these three registries to mark some of the codepoints as
    assigned for Experimental Use.  
    As stated in <xref target="RFC3692"/>, experiments using these codepoints  are not intended to be used in general deployments, and due care must be taken
to ensure that two experiments using the same codepoints are not run in
the same environment. See <xref target="RFC3692"/> for further discussion
    of the use of experimental codepoints (also referred to as "experimental
    and testing numbers").

<section title="Experimental PCEP Messages" toc="default">
    <t>PCEP message types are in the range 0 to 255.  This document sets
   aside message types 252-255 for experimentation as described in
   <xref target="sec_iana_msg"/>.
    </t>
</section>
<section title="Experimental PCEP Objects" toc="default">
    <t>PCEP objects are identified by values in the range 0 to 255.  This
   document sets aside object identifiers 248-255 for experimentation as

<section title="Experimental PCEP TLVs" toc="default">
<t>PCEP TLV type codes are in the range 0 to 65535.  This document sets

<section title="Handling of Unknown Experimentation">
	<t>A PCEP implementation that receives an experimental PCEP message
	that it does not recognize reacts by sending a PCErr message with
	Error-Type=2 (capability not supported) per Section 6.9 of 
	<xref target="RFC5440"/>.
</t>
   <t>If a PCEP speaker does not understand or support an experimental
   object, then the way it handles this situation depends on the message
   type.  For example, a PCE handles an unknown object in the Path
   Computation Request (PCReq) message according to the rules of
   <xref target="RFC5440"/>. Message-specific behavior may be specified (e.g.,
   <xref target="RFC8231"/> defines rules for a PCC to handle an unknown object in a
   Path Computation LSP Update Request (PCUpd) message).

    </t>
   <t>As per Section 7.1 of <xref target="RFC5440"/>, an unknown experimental
   PCEP TLV would be ignored.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC3692"/> asserts that the existence of experimental codepoints 
   introduce no new security considerations.  However, implementations
   accepting experimental codepoints need to take care in how they parse
   and process the messages, objects, and TLVs in case they come,
   accidentally, from another experiment. Further, an implementation accepting
   experimental codepoints needs to consider
    the security aspects of the experimental extensions. <xref target="RFC6709"/>
    provides various design considerations for protocol extensions
    (including those designated as experimental).</t>

    <t>
   Based on feedback from the PCE WG, it was decided to allocate an
   Experimental codepoint range only in the message, object, and TLV
   sub-registries.  The justification for this decision is that, if
   an experiment finds that it wants to use a new codepoint in
   another PCEP sub-registry, it can implement the same function using
   a new experimental object or TLV instead.
