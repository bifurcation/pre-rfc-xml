  <abstract>
    <t>Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses
      that are not globally unique.  Examples are the addresses
      designated in RFC 1918 for private use within individual
      sites.</t>

    <t>Hosts should never normally send DNS reverse-mapping queries
      for those addresses on the public Internet. However, such
      queries are frequently observed. Authoritative servers are
      deployed to provide authoritative answers to such queries as
      part of a loosely coordinated effort known as the AS112
      project.</t>

    <t>Since queries sent to AS112 servers are usually not intentional,
      the replies received back from those servers are typically
      unexpected. Unexpected inbound traffic can trigger alarms on
      intrusion detection systems and firewalls, and operators of
      such systems often mistakenly believe that they are being
      attacked.</t>

    <t>This document provides background information and technical
      advice to those firewall operators.</t>
  </abstract>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction and Target Audience">
      <t>Readers of this document may well have experienced an alarm
	from a firewall or an intrusion-detection system, triggered
	by unexpected inbound traffic from the Internet. The traffic
	probably appeared to originate from one of several hosts
	discussed further below.</t>

      <t>The published contacts for those hosts may well have
        suggested that you consult this document.</t>

      <t>If you are following up on such an event, you are encouraged
	to follow your normal security procedures and take whatever
	action you consider to be appropriate. This document
        contains information that may assist you.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Private-Use Addresses" anchor="priv">
      <t>Many sites connected to the Internet make use of address
        blocks designated in <xref target="RFC1918"/> for private
        use.  One example of such addresses is 10.1.30.20.</t>

      <t>Because these ranges of addresses are used by many sites
	all over the world, each individual address can only ever
	have local significance. For example, the host numbered
	192.168.18.234 in one site almost certainly has nothing to
	do with a host with the same address located in a different
	site.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="DNS Reverse Mapping">
       <t>The <xref target="RFC1034">Domain Name System (DNS)</xref>
         can be used to obtain a name for a particular network
         address. The process by which this happens is as follows:

         <list style="numbers">
           <t>The network address is rearranged in order to construct
             a name that can be looked up in the DNS. For example, the
             IPv4 address 10.1.30.20 corresponds to the DNS name
             20.30.1.10.IN-ADDR.ARPA.</t>

           <t>A DNS query is constructed for that name, requesting
             a DNS record of the type "PTR".</t>

           <t>The DNS query is sent to a resolver.</t>

           <t>If a response is received in response to the query, the
             answer will typically indicate either the hostname
             corresponding to the network address, or the fact that no
             hostname can be found.</t>
         </list>

	 This procedure is generally carried out automatically by
	 software, and hence is largely hidden from users and
	 administrators. Applications might have reason to look up
	 an IP address in order to gather extra information for a
	 log file, for example.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="DNS Reverse Mapping for Private-Use Addresses" anchor="privrdns">
      <t>As noted in <xref target="priv"/>, private-use addresses
        have only local significance. This means that sending
        queries out to the Internet is not sensible: there is no
        way for the public DNS to provide a useful answer to a
        question that has no global meaning.</t>

      <t>Despite the fact that the public DNS cannot provide
	answers, many sites have misconfigurations in the way they
	connect to the Internet; this results in such queries
	relating to internal infrastructure being sent outside the
	site.  From the perspective of the public DNS, these queries
	are junk -- they cannot be answered usefully and result in
	unnecessary traffic being received by the nameservers which
	underpin the operation of the reverse DNS (the so-called
	<xref target="RFC5855">reverse servers</xref>, which serve
	"IN-ADDR.ARPA").</t>

      <t>To isolate this traffic and reduce the load on the rest
	of the reverse DNS infrastructure, dedicated servers have
	been deployed in the Internet to receive and reply to these
	junk queries. These servers are deployed in many places in
	a loosely coordinated effort known as the "AS112 project".
	More details about the AS112 project can be found at <eref
	target="http://www.as112.net/"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="AS112 Nameservers" anchor="nameservers">
      <t>The nameservers responsible for answering queries relating
        to private-use addresses are as follows:

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>PRISONER.IANA.ORG (192.175.48.1)</t>
          <t>BLACKHOLE-1.IANA.ORG (192.175.48.6)</t>
          <t>BLACKHOLE-2.IANA.ORG (192.175.48.42)</t>
        </list>

	A request sent to one of these servers will result in a
	response being returned to the client. The response will
	typically be a UDP datagram, although it's perfectly valid
	for requests to be made over TCP.  In both cases, the source
	port of packets returning to the site that originated the
	DNS request will be 53.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Inbound Traffic from AS112 Servers">
      <t>Where firewalls or intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are
        configured to block traffic received from AS112 servers,
        superficial review of the traffic may seem alarming to
        site administrators.

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Since requests directed ultimately to AS112 servers
            are usually triggered automatically by applications, 
            review of firewall logs may indicate a large number of
            policy violations occurring over an extended period of
            time.</t>

	  <t>Where responses from AS112 servers are blocked by
	    firewalls, hosts will often retry, often with a relatively
	    high frequency. This can cause inbound traffic to be
	    misclassified as a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.  In
	    some cases, the source ports used by individual hosts for
	    successive retries increase in a predictable fashion
	    (e.g. monotonically), which can cause the replies from
	    the AS112 server to resemble a port scan.</t>

	  <t>A site administrator may attempt to perform active
	    measurement of the remote host in response to alarms
	    raised by inbound traffic, e.g. initiating a port scan
	    in order to gather information about the host which is
	    apparently attacking the site. Such a scan will usually
	    result in additional inbound traffic to the site
	    performing the measurement, e.g., an apparent flood of
	    ICMP messages that may trigger additional firewall
	    alarms and obfuscate the process of identifying the
	    originally problematic traffic.</t>
	</list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Corrective Measures">
      <t>A site that receives responses from one of the nameservers
	listed in <xref target="nameservers"/> is probably under
	no immediate danger, and the traffic associated with those
	responses probably requires no emergency action by the site
	concerned. However, this document cannot aspire to dictate
	the security policy of individual sites, and it is recognised
	that many sites will have perfectly valid policies that
	dictate that corrective measures should be taken to stop
	the responses from AS112 servers.</t>

      <t>It should be noted, however, that the operators of AS112
	nameservers, which are generating the responses described
	in this document, are not ultimately responsible for the
	inbound traffic received by the site: that traffic is
	generated in response to queries that are sent out from
	the site, and so the only effective measures to stop the
	inbound traffic is to prevent the original queries from
	being made.</t>

      <t>Possible measures that might be taken to prevent these
        queries include:

        <list style="numbers">
	  <t>Stop hosts from making these DNS reverse-mapping queries in
	    the first place. In some cases, servers can be configured
	    not to perform DNS reverse-mapping lookups, for example. As a
	    general site-wide approach, however, this measure is
	    frequently difficult to implement due to the large
            number of hosts and applications involved.</t>

	  <t>Block DNS reverse-mapping queries to the AS112 servers from
	    leaving the site using firewalls between the site and
	    the Internet. Although this might appear to be sensible,
	    such a measure might have unintended consequences: the
	    inability to receive an answer to DNS reverse-mapping queries
	    might lead to long DNS lookup timeouts, for example,
	    which could cause applications to malfunction.  (It may
            also lead to the belief that the Internet or the local
            network is down.)</t>

	  <t>Configure all DNS resolvers in the site to answer
	    authoritatively for the zones corresponding to the
            private-use address blocks in use. This should prevent
            resolvers from ever needing to send these queries to
            the public DNS. Guidance and recommendations for
            this aspect of resolver configuration can be found in
            <xref target="RFC6303"/>.</t>

          <t>Implement a private AS112 node within the site. Guidance for 
            constructing an AS112 node may be found in
            <xref target="RFC6304"/>.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="AS112 Contact Information">
      <t>More information about the AS112 project can be found
        at <eref target="http://www.as112.net/"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>The AS112 nameservers are all named under the domain
	IANA.ORG (see <xref target="nameservers"/>). The IANA is
	the organisation responsible for the coordination of many
	technical aspects of the Internet's basic infrastructure.
	The AS112 project nameservers provide a public service to
	the Internet that is sanctioned by and operated in
	loose coordination with the IANA.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
      <t>The purpose of this document is to help site administrators
        properly identify traffic received from AS112 nodes and 
        to provide background information to allow appropriate
        measures to be taken in response to it.</t>

      <t>Hosts should never normally send queries to AS112 servers:
	queries relating to private-use addresses should be answered
	locally within a site. Hosts that send queries to AS112
	servers may well leak information relating to private
	infrastructure to the public network; this could represent
	a security risk.</t>
