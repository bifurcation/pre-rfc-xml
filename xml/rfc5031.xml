<abstract>

<t>
The content of many communication services depends on the context, such
as the user's location.  We describe a 'service' URN that allows
well-known context-dependent services that can be resolved in a
distributed manner to be identified.  Examples include emergency services, directory
assistance, and call-before-you-dig hot lines.
</t>

</abstract>
</front>
<middle>
<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>In existing telecommunications systems, there are many well-known
communication and information services that are offered by loosely
coordinated entities across a large geographic region, with well-known
identifiers.  Some of the services are operated by governments or
regulated monopolies, others by competing commercial enterprises. 
Examples include emergency services (reached by dialing 9-1-1 in North
America, 1-1-2 in Europe), community services and volunteer
opportunities (2-1-1 in some regions of the United States), telephone
directory and repair services (4-1-1 and 6-1-1 in the United States and
Canada), government information services (3-1-1 in some cities in the
United States), lawyer referral services (1-800-LAWYER), car roadside
assistance (automobile clubs), and pizza delivery services. 
Unfortunately, almost all of them are limited in scope to a single
country or possibly a group of countries, such as those belonging to the
North American Numbering Plan or the European Union.  The same
identifiers are often used for other purposes outside that region,
making access to such services difficult when users travel or use
devices produced outside their home country.</t>

<t>These services are characterized by long-term stability of
user-visible identifiers, decentralized administration of the underlying
service, and a well-defined resolution or mapping mechanism.  For
example, there is no national coordination or call center for "9-1-1" in
the United States; rather, various local government organizations
cooperate to provide this service based on jurisdictions.</t>

<t>In this document, we propose a URN namespace that, together with
resolution protocols beyond the scope of this document, allows us to
define such global, well-known services, while distributing the actual
implementation across a large number of service-providing entities. 
There are many ways to divide provision of such services, such as
dividing responsibility by geographic region or by the service provider
a user chooses.  In addition, users can choose different mapping service
providers that in turn manage how geographic locations are mapped to
service providers.</t>

<t>Availability of such service identifiers allows end systems to convey
information about the desired service to other network entities.  For
example, an IP phone could have a special set of short cuts, address
book entries, or buttons that invoke emergency services.  When such a
service identifier is put into the outgoing <xref
target="RFC3261">Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)</xref> message, it
allows SIP proxies to unambiguously take actions, as it would not be
practical to configure them with dial strings and emergency numbers used
throughout the world.  Hence, such service identifiers make it possible
to delegate routing decisions to third parties and to mark certain
requests as having special characteristics while preventing these
characteristics from being accidentally invoked.</t>

<t>This URN identifies services independent of the particular protocol
that is used to request or deliver the service.  The URN may appear in
protocols that allow general URIs, such as the <xref
target="RFC3261">SIP</xref> request URIs, web pages, or mapping
protocols.</t>

<t>The service URN is a protocol element and is generally not expected to
be visible to humans.  For example, it is expected that callers will
still dial the emergency number '9-1-1' in the United States to reach
emergency services.  In some other cases, speed dial buttons might
identify the service, as is common practice on hotel phones today. 
(Speed dial buttons for summoning emergency help are considered
inappropriate by most emergency services professionals, at least for
mobile devices, as they are too prone to being triggered
accidentally.)</t>

<t>The translation of service dial strings or service numbers to service
URNs in the end host is beyond the scope of this document.  These
translations likely depend on the location of the caller and may be
many-to-one, i.e., several service numbers may map to one service URN. 
For example, a phone for a traveler could recognize the emergency
service number for both the traveler's home location and the traveler's
visited location, mapping both to the same universal service URN,
urn:service:sos.</t>

<t>Since service URNs are not routable, a SIP proxy or user agent has to
translate the service URN into a routable URI for a location-appropriate
service provider, such as a SIP URL.  <xref
target="LOST">A Location-to-Service Translation
Protocol (LoST)</xref> is expected to be used as a
resolution system for mapping service URNs to URLs based on geographic
location.  In the future, there may be several such protocols, possibly
different ones for different services.</t>

<t>Services are described by top-level service type, and may contain a
hierarchy of sub-services that further describe the service, as outlined in
<xref target="registration"/>. </t>

<t>We discuss alternative approaches for creating service identifiers,
and why they are unsatisfactory, in <xref target="alternatives"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="registration" title="Registration Template">

<t>Below, we include the registration template for the URN scheme
according to <xref target="RFC3406">RFC 3406</xref>.</t>

<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="Namespace ID:">service</t>

</t>

<t hangText="Declaration of syntactic structure:"> The URN consists of a
hierarchical service identifier, with a sequence of labels separated by
periods.  The left-most label is the most significant one and is called
'top-level service', while names to the right are called 'sub-services'. 
The set of allowable characters is the same as that for domain names
<xref target="RFC1123"/> and a subset of the labels allowed in <xref
target="RFC3958"/>.  Labels are case-insensitive, but MUST be specified
in all lower-case.  For any given service URN, service-identifiers can
be removed right-to-left; the resulting URN is still valid, referring to
a more generic service.  In other words, if a service 'x.y.z' exists,
the URNs 'x' and 'x.y' are also valid service URNs.  The <xref
target="RFC4234">ABNF</xref> is shown below.

<artwork>
  service-URN  = "URN:service:" service
  service      = top-level *("." sub-service)
  top-level    = let-dig [ *25let-dig-hyp let-dig ]

  DIGIT        = %x30-39 ; 0-9
</artwork>
</t>

<t hangText="Relevant ancillary documentation:">None
</t>

<t hangText="Community considerations:"> The service URN is believed to
be relevant to a large cross-section of Internet users, including both
technical and non-technical users, on a variety of devices, but
particularly for mobile and nomadic users.  The service URN will allow
Internet users needing services to identify the service by kind, without
having to determine manually who provides the particular service in the
user's current context, e.g., at the user's current location.  For
example, travelers will be able to use their mobile devices to
request emergency services without having to know the emergency dial
string of the visited country.  The assignment of identifiers is
described in the <xref target="iana">IANA Considerations</xref>.  The
service URN does not prescribe a particular resolution mechanism, but it
is assumed that a number of different entities could operate and offer
such mechanisms.
</t>

<t hangText="Namespace considerations:"> There do not appear to be other
URN namespaces that serve the same need of uniquely identifying
widely-available communication and information services.  Unlike most
other currently registered URN namespaces, the service URN does not
identify documents and protocol objects (e.g., <xref target="RFC3044"/>,
<xref target="RFC3187"/>, <xref target="RFC4179"/>, and <xref
target="RFC4195"/>), types of telecommunications equipment <xref
target="RFC4152"/>, people, or organizations <xref target="RFC3043"/>. 
<xref target="RFC3966">tel URIs</xref> identify telephone numbers, but
numbers commonly identifying services (such as 911 or 112) are specific
to a particular region or country.
</t>

<t hangText="Identifier uniqueness considerations:"> A service URN
identifies a logical service, specified in the service registration (see
<xref target="iana">IANA Considerations</xref>).  Resolution of the URN,
if successful, will return a particular instance of the service, and
this instance may be different even for two users making the same
request in the same place at the same time; the logical service
identified by the URN, however, is persistent and unique.  Service URNs
MUST be unique for each unique service; this is guaranteed through the
registration of each service within this namespace, described in <xref
target="iana"/>.</t>

<t hangText="Identifier persistence considerations:">The 'service' URN
for the same service is expected to be persistent, although there
naturally cannot be a guarantee that a particular service will continue
to be available globally or at all times.
</t>

<t hangText="Process of identifier assignment:">The process of
identifier assignment is described in the <xref target="iana">IANA
Considerations</xref>.
</t>

<t hangText="Process for identifier resolution:">There is no single
global resolution service for 'service' URNs.  However, each top-level
service can provide a set of mapping protocols to be used with 'service'
URNs of that service.
</t>

<t hangText="Rules for lexical equivalence:">'service' identifiers are
compared according to case-insensitive string equality.
</t>

<t hangText="Conformance with URN syntax:">The BNF in the 'Declaration
of syntactic structure' above constrains the syntax for this URN
scheme.
</t>

<t hangText="Validation mechanism:">Validation determines whether a
given string is currently a validly-assigned URN <xref
target="RFC3406"/>.  Due to the distributed nature of the mapping
mechanism, and since not all services are available everywhere and not
all mapping servers may be configured with all current service
registrations, validation in this sense is not possible.  Also, the
discovery mechanism for the mapping mechanism may not be configured with
all current top-level services.</t>

<t hangText="Scope:">The scope for this URN is public and global.

<t>The 'sos' service type describes emergency services requiring an

government or other public institutions.  Additional sub-services can be
added after expert review and must be of general public interest and
have a similar emergency nature.  The expert is designated by the ECRIT
working group, its successor, or, in their absence, the IESG.  The
expert review should only approve emergency services that are offered
widely and in different countries, with approximately the same caller
expectation in terms of services rendered.  The 'sos' service is not
meant to invoke general government, public information, counseling, or
social services.</t>

<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

<t>As an identifier, the service URN does not appear to raise any
particular security issues.  The services described by the URN are meant
to be well-known, even if the particular service instance is
access-controlled, so privacy considerations do not apply to the URN. 
There are likely no specific privacy issues when including a service URN
on a web page, for example.  On the other hand, ferrying the URN in a
signaling protocol can give attackers information on the kind of service
desired by the caller.  For example, this makes it easier for the
attacker to automatically find all calls for emergency services or
directory assistance.  Appropriate, protocol-specific security
mechanisms need to be implemented for protocols carrying service URNs. 
The mapping protocol needs to address a number of threats, as detailed
in <xref target="RFC5069"/>. That document also
discusses the security considerations related to the use of the service
URN for emergency services.</t>

<t>The discussions of ways to identify emergency calls has yielded a

these solutions.</t>
<t></t>
<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="tel:NNN;context=+C"> This approach uses <xref

number, where the country is identified by the context C. This approach
is easy for user agents to implement, but hard for proxies and other SIP
elements to recognize, as it would have to know about all number-context
combinations in the world and track occasional changes.  In addition,
many of these numbers are being used for other services.  For example,
the emergency number in Paraguay (00) is also used to call the
international operator in the United States.  As another example, a
number of countries, such as Italy, use 118 as an emergency number, but
it also connects to directory assistance in Finland.</t>

<t hangText="tel:sos"> This solution avoids name conflicts, but
requires extending the "tel" URI <xref target="RFC3966">"tel"</xref>.  It also only works if
every outbound proxy knows how to route requests to a proxy that can
reach emergency services since tel URIs do not identify the
destination server.</t>

<t hangText="sip:sos@domain"> Earlier work had defined a special user
identifier, sos, within the caller's home domain in a SIP URI, for
example, sip:sos@example.com.  Such a user identifier follows the
convention of <xref target="RFC2142">RFC 2142</xref> and the
"postmaster" convention documented in <xref target="RFC2822">RFC
2822</xref>.  This approach had the advantage that dial plans in
existing user agents could probably be converted to generate such a URI
and that only the home proxy for the domain has to understand the user
naming convention.  However, it overloads the user part of the URI with
specific semantics rather than being opaque, makes routing by the
outbound proxy a special case that does not conform to normal SIP
request-URI handling rules and is SIP-specific.  The mechanism also does
not extend readily to other services.</t>

<t hangText="SIP URI user parameter:">One could create a special URI,
such as "aor-domain;user=sos".  This avoids the name conflict problem,
but requires mechanism-aware user agents that are capable of emitting
this special URI.  Also, the 'user' parameter is meant to describe the
format of the user part of the SIP URI, which this usage does not do. 
Adding other parameters still leaves unclear what, if any, conventions
should be used for the user and domain part of the URL.  Neither
solution is likely to be backward-compatible with existing clients.
</t>

<t hangText="Special domain:">A special domain, such as
"sip:fire@sos.int" could be used to identify emergency calls.  This has
similar properties as the "tel:sos" URI, except that it is indeed a
valid URI.  To make this usable, the special domain would have to be
operational and point to an appropriate emergency services proxy. 
Having a single, if logical, emergency services proxy for the whole
world seems to have undesirable scaling and administrative
properties.
