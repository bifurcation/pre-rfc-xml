<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

  <t>
    The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 1 (OLSRv1)
    <xref target="RFC3626"/> is a proactive routing protocol for
    mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) <xref target="RFC2501"/>.
    OLSRv1 finds the shortest, defined as minimum number of hops,
    routes from a router to all possible destinations.
  </t>

  <t>
    Using only minimum hop routes may result in what are, in practice,
    inferior routes. Some examples are given in <xref target="scenarios"/>.
    Thus, one of the distinguishing features of the Optimized Link State
    Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) <xref target="RFCYYYY"/> is the
    introduction of the ability to select routes using link metrics other
    than the number of hops.
  </t>

  <t>
    During the development of OLSRv2, the working group and authors 
    repeatedly discussed how and why some choices were made in the
    protocol specification, particularly at the metric integration
    level. Some of the issues may be non-intuitive, and this document
    is presented as a record of the considerations and decisions to
    provide informational discussion about motivation and historic
    design choices. This document is intended to be useful as a
    reference if those questions arise again.
  </t>


  <t>
    Use of the extensible message format <xref target="RFC5444"/> by OLSRv2
    has allowed the addition, by OLSRv2, of link metric information to the
    HELLO messages defined in the MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)
    <xref target="RFC6130"/> as well as inclusion in the Topology Control (TC)
    messages defined in <xref target="RFCYYYY"/>.
  </t>


  <t>
    OLSRv2 essentially first determines local link metrics from 1-hop
    neighbors, these being defined by a process outside OLSRv2, then
    distributes required link metric values in HELLO messages and TC messages,
    and then finally forms routes with minimum total link metric. Using a
    definition of route metric other than number of hops is a natural
    extension that is commonly used in link state protocols.
  </t>


  <t>
    A metric-based route selection process for OLSRv2 could have been
    handled as an extension to OLSRv2. However, were this to have been done,
    OLSRv2 routers that did not implement this extension would not recognize
    any link metric information and would attempt to use minimum hop-count
    routes. This would have meant that, in effect, routers that did implement and
routers that did
    not implement this extension would differ over their valuation of links
    and routes. This would have led to the fundamental routing problem of
    "looping". Thus, if metric-based route selection were to have been
    considered only as an extension to OLSRv2, then routers that did implement and
    routers that did not implement this extension would not have been able
    to interoperate. This would have been a significant limitation of such
    an extension. Link metrics were therefore included as standard in OLSRv2.
  </t>

  <t>
    This document discusses the motivation and design rationale behind how
    link metrics were included in OLSRv2. The principal issues involved when
    including link metrics in OLSRv2 were:
  </t>

  <t>
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>
        Assigning metrics to links involved considering separate metrics
        for the two directions of a link, with the receiving router determining
        the metric from transmitter to receiver. A metric used by OLSRv2 may be
        either of:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            A link metric, the metric of a specific link from an OLSRv2 interface
            of the transmitting router to an OLSRv2 interface of the receiving router.
          </t>
          <t>
            A neighbor metric, the minimum of the link metrics between two OLSRv2
            routers, in the indicated direction.
          </t>
        </list>
        These metrics are necessarily the same when these routers each have a
        single OLSRv2 interface but may differ when either has more. HELLO
        messages may include both link metrics and neighbor metrics. TC messages
        include only neighbor metrics.
      </t>

      <t>
        Metrics as used in OLSRv2 are defined to be dimensionless and additive. The
        assignment of metrics, including their relationship to real parameters such
        as data rate, loss rate, and delay, and the management of the choice of
        metric, is outside the scope of <xref target="RFCYYYY"/>, which simply
        uses these metrics in a consistent manner. Within a single MANET, including
        all components of a temporarily fragmented MANET, a single choice of
        link metric is used. By use of a registry of metric types (employing
        extended types of a single Address Block TLV type), routers can be configured
        to use only a subset of the available metric types.
      </t>

      <t>
        Node metrics were not included in OLSRv2. Node metrics can be implemented by
        the addition of the corresponding value to all incoming link metrics by the
        corresponding router.
      </t>

      <t>
        The separation of the two functions performed by multipoint relays (MPRs)
        in OLSRv1, optimized flooding and reduced topology advertisement for routing,
        into separate sets of MPRs in OLSRv2 <xref target="RFCYYYY"/>, denoted
        "flooding MPRs" and "routing MPRs". Flooding MPRs can be calculated as
        in <xref target="RFC3626"/>, but the use of link metrics in OLSRv2 can
        improve the MPR selection. Routing MPRs need a metric-aware selection
        algorithm. The selection of routing MPRs guarantees the use of minimum
        distance routes using the chosen metric, while using only symmetric
        2-hop neighborhood information from HELLO messages and routing MPR
        selector information from TC messages.
      </t>

      <t>
        The protocol Information Bases defined in OLSRv2 include required
        metric values. This has included additions to the protocol Information
        Bases defined in NHDP <xref target="RFC6130"/> when used by OLSRv2.

  <t>
    The objective of this document is to retain the design considerations
    behind how link metrics were included in <xref target="RFCYYYY"/>. This
    document does not prescribe any behavior but explains some aspects
    of the operation of OLSRv2.
  </t>

</section>

<section anchor="scenarios" title="Motivational Scenarios">

  <t>
    The basic situation that suggests the desirability of use of routes
    other than minimum hop routes is shown in <xref target="scenario-a"/>.
  </t>

  <figure anchor="scenario-a">
    <artwork>
                            A ----- X ----- B
                             \             /
                              \           /
                               Y ------- Z
    </artwork>
  </figure>

  <t>
    The minimum hop route from A to B is via X. However, if the links A to X and
    X to B are poor (e.g., have low data rate or are unreliable) but the links
    A to Y, Y to Z, and Z to B are better (e.g., have reliable high data rate),
    then the route A to B via Y and Z may be preferred to that via X.
  </t>

  <t>
   There are other situations where the use of some links should be 
   discouraged, even if the avoidance of them
   does not show immediately obvious benefits to users.
    Consider a network with many short-range links and a few long-range links.
    Use of minimum hop routes will immediately lead to heavy use of the long-range
    links. This will be particularly undesirable if those links achieve their
    longer range through reduced data rate or through being less reliable.
    However, even if the long-range links have the same characteristics as the
    short-range links, it may be better to reserve usage of the long-range
    links for when this usage is particularly valuable -- for example, when the
    use of one long-range link saves several short-range links, rather than
    the single link saving that is needed for a minimum hop route.
  </t>

  <t>
    A related case is that of a privileged relay. An example is an aerial
    router in an otherwise ground-based network. The aerial router may have a link
    to many, or even all, other routers. That would lead to all routers attempting
    to send all their traffic (other than to symmetric 1-hop neighbors and some
    symmetric 2-hop neighbors) via the aerial router. It may, however, be important to
    reserve that capacity for cases where the aerial router is actually essential,
    such as if the ground-based portion of the network is not connected.
  </t>

  <t>
    Link metrics provide a possible solution to these scenarios. For example,
    in <xref target="scenario-a"/>, the route A to Y to Z to B could be preferred
    to A to X to B by making the metrics on the former path 1 and those on the
    latter path 2. The aerial privileged relay could be used only when
    necessary by giving its links maximal metric values, with much smaller
    other metric values or, if the aerial link is to be preferred to N ground
    links, by giving the ground links metric values of 1 while making the sum of
    the aerial node uplink and downlink metrics equal to N.
  </t>



  <t>
  Other cases may involve attempts to avoid areas of congestion, attempts to
  route around insecure routers, and attempts by routers to
  discourage being used as relays due to, for example, limited battery
  power.
OLSRv2 does have
    another mechanism to aid in this: a router's willingness to act as an MPR.
    However, there are cases where that cannot help but where use of non-minimum
    hop routes could.
  </t>

  <t>
    Similarly, note that OLSRv2's optional use of link
    quality (through its use of <xref target="RFC6130"/>) is not a solution to
    these problems. Use of link quality as specified in <xref target="RFC6130"/>
    allows a router to decline to use a link, not only on its own, but on all
    routers' behalf. It does not, for example, allow the use of a link otherwise
    determined to be too low quality to be generally useful as part of a route
    where no better links exist. These mechanisms (link quality and link metrics)
    solve distinctly different problems.
  </t>

  <t>
    It should also be noted that the loop-free property of OLSRv2 applies strictly
    only in the static state. When the network topology is changing and when messages
    can be lost, it is possible for transient loops to form. However, with update rates
    appropriate to the rate of topology change, such loops will be sufficiently rare.
    Changing link metrics is a form of network topology change and should be limited
    to a rate slower than the message information update rate (defined by the parameters
    HELLO_INTERVAL, HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL, REFRESH_INTERVAL, TC_INTERVAL, and TC_MIN_INTERVAL).
  </t>

</section>

<section anchor="metrics" title="Link Metrics">

  <t>
    This section describes the required and selected properties of the link metrics
    used in OLSRv2, followed by implementation details achieving those properties.
  </t>

  <section title="Link Metric Properties">

    <t>
      Link metrics in OLSRv2 are:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>
          Dimensionless. While they may, directly or indirectly, correspond to
          specific physical information (such as delay, loss rate, or data rate),
          this knowledge is not used by OLSRv2. Instead, generating the metric
          value is the responsibility of a mechanism external to OLSRv2.
        </t>
        <t>
          Additive, so that the metric of a route is the sum of the metrics
          of the links forming that route. Note that this requires a metric
          where a low value of a link metric indicates a "good" link and a
          high value of a link metric indicates a "bad" link, and the
          former will be preferred to the latter.
        </t>
        <t>
          Directional, the metric from router A to router B need not be the
          same as the metric from router B to router A, even when using the
          same OLSRv2 interfaces. At router A, a link metric from router
          B to router A is referred to as an incoming link metric, while a
          link metric from router A to router B is referred to as an
          outgoing link metric. (These are, of course, reversed at router B.)
        </t>
        <t>
          Specific to a pair of OLSRv2 interfaces, so that if there is more than
          one link from router A to router B, each has its own link metric in
          that direction. There is also an overall metric, a "neighbor metric",
          from router A to router B (its 1-hop neighbor). This is the minimum
          value of the link metrics from router A to router B, considering
          symmetric links only; it is undefined if there are no such symmetric
          links. A neighbor metric from one router to another is always equal
          to a link metric in the same direction between OLSRv2 interfaces of
          those routers. When referring to a specific OLSRv2 interface (for
          example, in a Link Tuple or a HELLO message sent on that OLSRv2 interface),
          a link metric always refers to a link on that OLSRv2 interface to or
          from the indicated 1-hop neighbor OLSRv2 interface, while a neighbor
          metric may be equal to a link metric to and/or from another OLSRv2
          interface.
        </t>
      </list>
    </t>

  </section>

  <section title="Link Metric Types">

    <t>
      There are various physical characteristics that may be used to define
      a link metric. Some examples, which also illustrate some characteristics
      of metrics that result, are:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>
          Delay is a straightforward metric; as it is naturally additive,
          the delay of a multi-link route is the sum of the delays of the
          links. This does not directly take into account delays due to
          routers (such as due to router queues or transition of packets
          between router interfaces) rather than links, but these delays
          can be divided among incoming and outgoing links.
        </t>
        <t>
          Probability of loss on a link is, as long as probabilities of loss
          are small and independent, approximately additive. (A slightly
          more accurate approach is using a negatively scaled logarithm of the
          probability of not losing a packet.) If losses are not independent,
          then this will be pessimistic.
        </t>
        <t>
          Data rates are not additive. They even have the wrong characteristic of
          being good when high and bad when low; thus, a mapping that inverts the
          ordering must be applied. Such a mapping can, at best, only
          produce a metric that is acceptable to treat as additive. Consider,
          for example, a preference for a route that maximizes the minimum
          data rate link on the route and then prefers a route with the fewest
          links of each data rate from the lowest. If links may be of three
          discrete data rates, "high", "medium", and "low", then this preference
          can be achieved, on the assumption that no route will have more than
          10 links, with metric values of 1, 10, and 100 for the three data rates.
          <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          If routes can have more than 10 links, the range of metrics must be
          increased; this was one reason for a preference for a wide "dynamic range"
          of link metric values. Depending on the ratios of the numerical values of
          the three data rates, the same effect may be achieved by using a scaling
          of an inverse power of the numerical values of the data rates. For example,
          if the three data rates were 2, 5, and 10 Mbit/s, then a
          possible mapping would be the fourth power of 10 Mbit/s divided by
          the data rate, giving metric values of 625, 16, and 1 (good for up to
          16 links in a route). This mapping can be extended to a system with
          more data rate values, for example, giving a 4 Mbit/s data rate a
          metric value of about 39. 




This may lose the capability to produce an
          absolutely maximal minimum data rate route but will usually produce
          either that, or something close (and at times maybe better, is a route
          of three 5 Mbit/s links really better than one of a single 4 Mbit/s
          link?). Specific metrics will need to define the mapping.
        </t>
      </list>
    </t>

    <t>
      There are also many other possible metrics, including using physical-layer
      information (such as signal-to-noise ratio and error-control statistics)
      and information such as packet-queuing statistics.
    </t>

    <t>
      In a well-designed network, all routers will use the same metric
      type. It will not produce good routes if, for example, some link metrics
      are based on data rate and some on path loss (except to the extent that
      these may be correlated). How to achieve this is an administrative matter,
      outside the scope of OLSRv2. In fact, even the actual physical meanings
      of the metrics is outside the scope of OLSRv2. This is because new metrics
      may be added in the future, for example, as data rates increase, and may be
      based on new, possibly non-physical, considerations, for example, financial
      cost. Each such type will have a metric type number. Initially, a single link
      metric type zero is defined as indicating a dimensionless metric with no
      predefined physical meaning.
    </t>

    <t>
      An OLSRv2 router is instructed which single link metric type to
      use and recognize, without knowing whether it represents delay, probability
      of loss, data rate, cost, or any other quantity. This recognized link metric
      type number is a router parameter and subject to change in case of
      reconfiguration or possibly the use of a protocol (outside the scope of
      OLSRv2) permitting a process of link metric type agreement between routers.
    </t>

    <t>
      The use of link metric type numbers also suggests the possibility of
      use of multiple link metric types and multiple network topologies. This
      is a possible future extension to OLSRv2. To allow for that future possibility,
      the sending of more than one metric of different physical types, which should
      otherwise not be done for reasons of efficiency, is not prohibited, but
      types other than that configured will be ignored.
    </t>

    <t>
      The following three sections assume a chosen single link metric type, of
      unspecified physical nature.
    </t>

  </section>

  <section title="Directional Link Metrics">

    <t>
      OLSRv2 uses only "symmetric" (bidirectional) links, which
      may carry traffic in either direction. A key decision was
      whether these links should each be assigned a single metric,
      used in both directions, or a metric in each direction, noting
      that:
    </t>

    <t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>
          Links can have different characteristics in each direction.
          Use of directional link metrics recognizes this.
        </t>
        <t>
          In many (possibly most) cases, the two ends of a link will
          naturally form different views as to what the link metric
          should be. To use a single link metric requires a coordination
          between the two that can be avoided if using directional metrics.
          Note that if using a single metric, it would be essential that
          the two ends agree as to its value; otherwise, it is possible
          for looping to occur. This problem does not occur for directional
          metrics.
        </t>
      </list>
    </t>

    <t>
      Based on these considerations, directional metrics are used in OLSRv2.
      Each router must thus be responsible for defining the metric in one
      direction only. This could have been in either direction, i.e., a router
      is responsible for either incoming or outgoing link metrics, as long
      as the choice is universal. The former (incoming) case is used in OLSRv2
      because, in general, receiving routers have more information available
      to determine link metrics (for example, received signal strength,
      interference levels, and error-control coding statistics).
    </t>

    <t>
      Note that, using directional metrics, if router A defines the metric
      of the link from router B to router A, then router B must use router A's
      definition of that metric on that link in that direction. (Router B
      could, if appropriate, use a bad mismatch between directional
      metrics as a reason to discontinue use of this link, using the
      link quality mechanism defined in <xref target="RFC6130"/>; note that
      this is a distinct mechanism from the use of link metrics.)
    </t>

  </section>

  <section anchor="metrics-reporting" title="Reporting Link and Neighbor Metrics">


    <t>
   Links, and hence link metrics, are reported in HELLO messages.
   A router must report incoming link metrics in its HELLO messages in
   order for these link metrics to be available at the other end of the link.
      This means that, for a symmetric link, both ends of the link will
      know both of the incoming and outgoing link metrics.
    </t>

    <t>
      As well as advertising incoming link metrics, HELLO messages also
      advertise incoming neighbor metrics. These are used for routing
      MPR selection (see <xref target="routing-mprs"/>), which requires
      use of the lowest metric link between two routers when more than
      one link exists. This neighbor metric may be using another OLSRv2
      interface, and hence, the link metric alone is insufficient.
    </t>

    <t>
      Metrics are also reported in TC messages. It can be shown that these
      need to be outgoing metrics:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>
          Router A must be responsible for advertising a metric from
          router A to router B in TC messages. This can be seen by considering
          a route connecting single OLSRv2 interface routers P to Q to R to S.
          Router P receives its only information about the link from R to S
          in the TC messages transmitted by router R, which is an MPR of
          router S (assuming that only MPR selectors are reported in
          TC messages). Router S may not even transmit TC messages (if no
          routers have selected it as an MPR and it has no attached networks
          to report). So any information about the metric of the link
          from R to S must also be included in the TC messages sent by
          router R; hence, router R is responsible for reporting the metric
          for the link from R to S.
        </t>
        <t>
          In a more general case, where there may be more than one link
          from R to S, the TC message must, so that minimum metric
          routes can be constructed (e.g., by router P), report the minimum
          of these outgoing link metrics, i.e., the outgoing neighbor
          metric from R to S.
        </t>
      </list>
    </t>

    <t>
      In this example, router P also receives information about the
      existence of a link between Q and R in the HELLO messages sent
      by router Q. Without the use of metrics, this link could be used
      by OLSRv2 for 2-hop routing to router R, using just HELLO
      messages sent by router Q. For this property (which accelerates
      local route formation) to be retained (from OLSRv1), router P
      must receive the metric from Q to R in HELLO messages sent
      by router Q. This indicates that router Q must be responsible
      for reporting the metric for the outgoing link from Q to R.
      This is in addition to the incoming link metric information
      that a HELLO message must report. Again, in general, this must
      be the outgoing neighbor metric, rather than the outgoing
      link metric.
    </t>

    <t>
      In addition, <xref target="flooding-mprs"/> offers an additional
      reason for reporting outgoing neighbor metrics in HELLO messages,
      without which metrics can properly affect only routing, not flooding.
    </t>

    <t>
      Note that there is no need to report an outgoing link metric
      in a HELLO message. The corresponding 1-hop neighbor knows that
      value; it specified it. Furthermore, for 2-hop neighborhood use, neighbor
      metrics are required (as these will, in general, not use the
      same OLSRv2 interface).
    </t>

  </section>

  <section title="Defining Incoming Link Metrics">

    <t>
      When a router reports a 1-hop neighbor in a HELLO message, it may do so
      for the first time with link status HEARD. As the router is responsible
      for defining and reporting incoming link metrics, it must evaluate that
      metric and attach that link metric to the appropriate address (which
      will have link status HEARD) in the next HELLO message reporting that
      address on that OLSRv2 interface. There will, at this time, be no outgoing
      link metric available to report, but a router must be able to immediately
      decide on an incoming link metric once it has heard a 1-hop neighbor on
      an OLSRv2 interface for the first time. 
    </t>

    <t>
      This is because, when receiving a HELLO message from this router, the
      1-hop neighbor seeing its own address listed with link status HEARD will
      (unless the separate link quality mechanism indicates otherwise) immediately
      consider that link to be SYMMETRIC, advertise it with that link status in
      future HELLO messages, and use it (for MPR selection and data traffic
      forwarding). 
    </t>
    <t>
      It may, depending on the physical nature of the link metric, be too early
      for an ideal decision as to that metric; however, a choice must be made.
      The metric value may later be refined based on further observation of
      HELLO messages, other message transmissions between the routers, or other
      observations of the environment. It will probably be best to over-estimate
      the metric if initially uncertain as to its value, to discourage, rather
      than over-encourage, its use. If no information other than the receipt of
      the HELLO message is available, then a conservative maximum link metric
      value, denoted MAXIMUM_METRIC in <xref target="RFCYYYY"/>, should be used.
    </t>

  </section>

  <section anchor="metric-values" title="Link Metric Values">

  <t>
    Link metric values are recorded in LINK_METRIC TLVs, defined in
    <xref target="RFCYYYY"/>, using a compressed (lossy) representation
    that occupies 12 bits. The use of 12 bits is convenient because,
    when combined with 4 flag bits of additional information, described
    below, this results in a 2-octet value field. However, the use of
    12 bits, and thus the availability of 4 flag bits, was a consequence
    of a design to use a modified exponent/mantissa form with the
    following characteristics:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>
        The values represented are to be positive integers
        starting 1, 2, ...
      </t>
      <t>
        The maximum value represented should be close to, but
        less than 2^24 (^ denotes exponentiation in this
        section). This is so that with a route limited to no
        more than 255 hops, the maximum route metric is less
        than 2^32, i.e., can be stored in 32 bits. (The link
        metric value can be stored in 24 bits.)
      </t>
    </list>
  </t>


  <t>   A representation that is modified from an exponent/mantissa form
   with e bits of exponent and m bits of mantissa and that
   has the first of these properties is one that starts at 1,
   then is incremented by 1 up to 2^m, then has a further 2^m
   increments by 2, then a further 2^m increments by 4, and
   so on for 2^e sets of increments. 
This means that the
    represented value is never in error by more than a half
    (if rounding) or one (if truncating) part in 2^m, usually
    less.
  </t>
  <t>
    The position in the increment sequence, from 0 to 2^m-1,
    is considered as a form of mantissa and denoted a. The
    increment sequence number, from 0 to 2^e-1, is considered
    as a form of exponent and denoted b.
  </t>
  <t>
    The value represented by (b,a) can then be shown to be
    equal to (2^m+a+1)2^b-2^m. To verify this, note that:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>
        With fixed b, the difference between two values with
        consecutive values of a is 2^b, as expected.
      </t>
      <t>
        The value represented by (b,2^m-1) is (2^m+2^m)2^b-2^m.
        The value represented by (b+1,0) is (2^m+1)(2^(b+1))-2^m.
        The difference between these two values is 2^(b+1),
        as expected.
      </t>
    </list>
  </t>
  <t>
    The maximum represented value has b = 2^e-1 and a = 2^m-1
    and is (2^m+2^m)(2^(2^e-1))-2^m = 2^(2^e+m)-2^m. This is
    slightly less than 2^(2^e+m). The required 24-bit limit can
    be achieved if 2^e+m = 24. Of the possible (e,m) pairs that
    satisfy this equation, the pair e = 4, m = 8 was selected
    as most appropriate and is that used by OLSRv2. It uses the
    previously indicated e+m = 12 bits. An algorithm for converting
    from a 24-bit value v to a 12-bit pair (b,a) is given in
    Section 6.2 of <xref target="RFCYYYY"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
    As noted above, the 12-bit representation then shares two octets
    with 4 flag bits. Putting the flag bits first, it is then natural to
    put the exponent bits in the last four bits of the first octet
    and to put the mantissa bits in the second octet. The 12 consecutive
    bits, using network byte order (most significant octet first), then
    represent 256b+a. Note that the ordering of these 12-bit
    representation values is the same as the ordering of the 24-bit
    metric values. In other words, two 12-bit metrics fields can be
    compared for equality/ordering as if they were unsigned integers.
  </t>
  <t>
    The four flag bits each represent one kind of metric, defined
    by its direction (incoming or outgoing) and whether the metric
    is a link metric or a neighbor metric. As indicated by the flag
    bits set, a metric value may be of any combination of these
    four kinds of metric.

<section anchor="mprs" title="MPRs with Link Metrics">

  <t>
    MPRs are used for two purposes in OLSRv2. In both cases, it is
    MPR selectors that are actually used, MPR selectors being
    determined from MPRs advertised in HELLO messages.

    <list style="symbols">
      <t>
        Optimized Flooding. This uses the MPR selector status of symmetric
        1-hop neighbor routers from which messages are received in order
        to determine if these messages are to be forwarded. MPR
        selector status is recorded in the Neighbor Set (defined in
        <xref target="RFC6130"/> and extended in <xref target="RFCYYYY"/>)
        and determined from received HELLO messages.
      </t>
      <t>
        Routing. Non-local link information is based on information
        recorded in this router's Topology Information Base. That
        information is based on received TC messages. The neighbor
        information in these TC messages consists of addresses of the
        originating router's advertised (1-hop) neighbors, as recorded in that
        router's Neighbor Set (defined in <xref target="RFC6130"/> and extended
        in <xref target="RFCYYYY"/>). These advertised neighbors include all
        of the MPR selectors of the originating router.
      </t>
    </list>

  </t>
  
  <t>
    Metrics interact with these two uses of MPRs differently, as described
    in the following two sections. This leads to the requirement for two
    separate sets of MPRs for these two uses when using metrics. The relationship
    between these two sets of MPRs is considered in <xref target="relation-mprs"/>.
  </t>

  <section anchor="flooding-mprs" title="Flooding MPRs">

    <t>
      The essential detail of the "flooding MPR" selection specification is
      that a router must select a set of MPRs such that a message transmitted
      by a router and retransmitted by all its flooding MPRs will reach all
      of the selecting router's symmetric 2-hop neighbors.
    </t>

    <t>
      Flooding MPR selection can ignore metrics and produce a solution
      that meets the required specification. However, that does not mean that
      metrics cannot be usefully considered in selecting flooding MPRs. Consider
      the network in <xref target="flooding-a"/>, where numbers are metrics of
      links in the direction away from router A, towards router D.
    </t>

    <figure anchor="flooding-a">
      <artwork>
                                    3

      </artwork>
    </figure>

    <t>
      Which is the better flooding MPR selection by router A: B or C? If the metric
      represents probability of message loss, then clearly choosing B maximizes the
      probability of a message sent by A reaching D. This is despite C having a
      lower metric in its connection to A than B does. (Similar arguments about a
      preference for B can be made if, for example, the metric represents data rate
      or delay rather than probability of loss.)
    </t>

    <t>
      However, neither should only the second hop be considered. If this example
      is modified to that in <xref target="flooding-b"/>, where the numbers still
      are metrics of links in the direction away from router A, towards router
D, then it is possible that, when A is selecting flooding MPRs,
      selecting C is preferable to selecting B.
    </t>

    <figure anchor="flooding-b">

      </artwork>
    </figure>

    <t>
   If the metrics represent
      scaled values of delay or the probability of loss, then selecting C
      is clearly better. This indicates that the sum of metrics is an
      appropriate measure to use to choose between B and C.
    </t>


    <t>
      However, this is a particularly simple example. Usually, it is not a
      simple choice between two routers as a flooding MPR, each only adding one
      router coverage. When considering which router
      to next add as a flooding MPR, a more general process should incorporate
      the metric to that router
      and the metric from that router to each symmetric 2-hop neighbor as well
      as the number of newly covered symmetric 2-hop neighbors. Other factors
may also be included.
    </t>

    <t>
      The required specification for flooding MPR selection is in Section 18.4
      (also using Section 18.3) of <xref target="RFCYYYY"/>, which may use the
      example MPR selection algorithm in Appendix B of <xref target="RFCYYYY"/>.
      However, note that (as in <xref target="RFC3626"/>) each router can make
      its own independent choice of flooding MPRs, and flooding MPR selection
      algorithm, and still interoperate.
    </t>

    <t>
      Also note that the references above to the direction of the metrics is
      correct: for flooding, directional metrics outward from a router are
      appropriate, i.e., metrics in the direction of the flooding. This is
      an additional reason for including outward metrics in HELLO messages,
      as otherwise a metric-aware MPR selection for flooding is not possible.
      The second-hop metrics are outgoing neighbor metrics because the OLSRv2
      interface used for a second-hop transmission may not be the same as 
      that used for the first-hop reception.
    </t>

  </section>

  <section anchor="routing-mprs" title="Routing MPRs">

    <t>
      The essential detail of the "routing MPR" selection specification is
      that a router must, per OLSRv2 interface, select a set of MPRs such that
      there is a 2-hop route from each symmetric 2-hop neighbor of the
      selecting router to the selecting router, with the intermediate router
      on each such route being a routing MPR of the selecting router.
    </t>

    <t>
      It is sufficient, when using an additive link metric rather than a
      hop count, to require that these routing MPRs provide not just a 2-hop 
      route but a minimum distance 2-hop route. In addition, a
      router is a symmetric 2-hop neighbor even if it is a symmetric
      1-hop neighbor, as long as there is a 2-hop route from it that is
      shorter than the 1-hop link from it. (The property that no routes
      go through routers with willingness WILL_NEVER is retained. Examples
      below assume that all routers are equally willing, with none having
      willingness WILL_NEVER.)
    </t>

    <t>
      For example, consider the network in <xref target="routing-a"/>.
      Numbers are metrics of links in the direction towards router A,
      away from router D.  Router A must pick router B as a routing MPR,
      whereas for minimum hop count routing, it could alternatively pick
      router C. Note that the use of incoming neighbor metrics in this case
      follows the same reasoning as for the directionality of metrics
      in TC messages, as described in <xref target="metrics-reporting"/>.

      of lowest total metric routes, even if all links (advertised or not) are

    <t>
      Using the above definition, A must pick both B and C as routing MPRs, in
      order to cover the symmetric 2-hop neighbors C and D, respectively.
      (C is a symmetric 2-hop neighbor because the route length via B is
      shorter than the 1-hop link.)
    </t>

    <t>
      However, A only needs to pick B as a routing MPR, because the only reason
      to pick C as a routing MPR would be so that C can advertise the link to A
      for routing -- to be used by, for example, E. However, A knows that no other router
      should use the link C to A in a shortest route because routing via B is shorter.
      So, if there is no need to advertise the link from C to A, then there is no reason
      for A to select C as a routing MPR.
    </t>

    <t>
      This process of "thinning out" the routing MPR selection uses only local information
      from HELLO messages. Using any minimum distance algorithm, the router identifies
      shortest routes, whether one, two, or more hops, from all routers in its symmetric
      2-hop neighborhood. It then selects as MPRs all symmetric 1-hop neighbors that are
      the last router (before the selecting router itself) on any such route. Where there
      is more than one shortest distance route from a router, only one such route is required.
      Alternative routes may be selected so as to minimize the number of last routers -- this
      is the equivalent to the selection of a minimal set of MPRs in the non-metric case.
    </t>

    <t>
      Note that this only removes routing MPRs whose selection can be directly seen to be
      unnecessary. Consequently, if (as is shown in <xref target="mpr-proof"/>) the first
      approach creates minimum distance routes, then so does this process.
    </t>

    <t>
      The examples in Figures 5 and 6 show that
      use of link metrics may require a router to select more routing MPRs than when not
      using metrics and even require a router to select routing MPRs when, without metrics,
      it would not need any routing MPRs. This may result in more, and larger, messages
      being generated and forwarded more often. Thus, the use of link metrics is not without
      cost, even excluding the cost of link metric signaling.
    </t>

    <t>
      These examples consider only single OLSRv2 interface routers. However, if routers have
      more than one OLSRv2 interface, then the process is unchanged; other than that, if there
      is more than one known metric between two routers (on different OLSRv2 interfaces), then,
      considering symmetric links only (as only these are used for routing) the smallest link
      metric, i.e., the neighbor metric, is used. There is no need to calculate routing MPRs
      per OLSRv2 interface. That requirement results from the consideration of flooding and the
      need to avoid certain "race" conditions, which are not relevant to routing, only to
      flooding.
    </t>

    <t>
      The required specification for routing MPR selection is in Section 18.5
      (also using Section 18.3) of <xref target="RFCYYYY"/>, which may use the
      example MPR selection algorithm in Appendix B of <xref target="RFCYYYY"/>.
      However, note that (as in <xref target="RFC3626"/>) each router can make
      its own independent choice of routing MPRs, and routing MPR selection
      algorithm, and still interoperate.
    </t>

  <section anchor="relation-mprs" title="Relationship between MPR Sets">

    <t>
      It would be convenient if the two sets of flooding and routing MPRs were
      the same. This can be the case if all metrics are equal, but in general,
      for "good" sets of MPRs, they are not. (A reasonable definition of this is
      that there is no common minimal set of MPRs.) If metrics are asymmetrically
      valued (the two sets of MPRs use opposite direction metrics) or routers
      have multiple OLSRv2 interfaces (where routing MPRs can ignore this but
      flooding MPRs cannot), this is particularly unlikely. However, even using
      a symmetrically valued metric with a single OLSRv2 interface on each router,
      the ideal sets need not be equal, nor is one always a subset of the other.
      To show this, consider these examples, where all lettered routers are assumed
      equally willing to be MPRs, and numbers are bidirectional metrics for links.
    </t>

     <t>
      In <xref target="relation-a"/>, A does not require any flooding MPRs.
      However, A must select B as a routing MPR.

      In <xref target="relation-b"/>, A must select C and D as routing MPRs.
      However, A's minimal set of flooding MPRs is just B. In this example,
      the set of routing MPRs serves as a set of flooding MPRs, but a
      non-minimal one (although one that might be better, depending on the
      relative importance of number of MPRs and flooding link metrics).

<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

  <t>
    An attacker can have an adverse impact on an OLSRv2 network by creating
    apparently valid messages that contain incorrect link metrics. This could
    take the form of influencing the choice of routes or, in some cases,
    producing routing loops. This is a more subtle, and likely to be less
    effective, attack than other forms of invalid message injection. These
    can add and remove other and more basic forms of network information,
    such as the existence of some routers and links.
  </t>

  <t>
    As such, no significantly new security issues arose from the inclusion
    of metrics in OLSRv2. Defenses to the injection of invalid link metrics
    are the same as to other forms of invalid message injection, as discussed
    in the Security Considerations section of <xref target="RFCYYYY"/>.
  </t>

  <t>
    There are possible uses for link metrics in the creation of security
    countermeasures to prefer the use of links that have better security
    properties, including better availability, to those with poorer
    security properties. This, however, is beyond the scope of both this
    document and <xref target="RFCYYYY"/>.

<section anchor="mpr-proof" title="MPR Routing Property">

  <t>
    In order for routers to find and use shortest routes in
    a network while using the minimum reduced topology
    supported by OLSRv2 (that a router only advertises its
    MPR selectors in TC messages), routing MPR selection must
    result in the property that there are shortest routes with
    all intermediate routers being routing MPRs.
  </t>

  <t>
    This appendix uses the following terminology and assumptions:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>
        The network is a graph of nodes connected by arcs, where
        nodes correspond to routers with willingness not equal to
        WILL_NEVER (except possibly at the ends of routes). An arc
        corresponds to the set of symmetric links connecting those
        routers; the OLSRv2 interfaces used by those links are not
        relevant.
      </t>
      <t>
        Each arc has a metric in each direction, being the minimum
        of the corresponding link metrics in that direction, i.e.,
        the corresponding neighbor metric. This metric must be positive.
      </t>
      <t>
        A sequence of arcs joining two nodes is referred to as a
        path.
      </t>
      <t>
        Node A is an MPR of node B if corresponding router A is
        a routing MPR of router B.
      </t>
    </list>
  </t>


  <t>
  The required property (of using shortest routes with reduced
  topology) is equivalent to the following property: for any pair 
  of distinct nodes X and Z, there is a shortest path from X to Z, 
  X - Y1 - Y2 - ... - Ym - Z such that Y1 is an MPR of Y2, ..., 
  Ym is an MPR of Z.
Call such a
    path a routable path, and call this property the routable path
    property.
  </t>


  <t>
    The required definition for a node X selecting MPRs is that for
    each distinct node Z from which there is a two-arc path, there is
    a shorter, or equally short, path that is either Z - Y - X
    where Y is an MPR of X or is the one-arc path Z - X. 
  Note that the existence of
  locally known, shorter paths that have more than two arcs, which can be
  used to reduce the numbers of MPRs, is not considered here.
(Such reductions are only when the remaining
    MPRs can be seen to retain all necessary shortest paths and
    therefore retain the required property.)
  </t>

  <t>
    Although this appendix is concerned with paths with minimum total
    metric, not number of arcs (hop count), it proceeds by induction on
    the number of arcs in a path. Although it considers minimum metric
    routes with a bounded number of arcs, it then allows that number of
    arcs to increase so that overall minimum metric paths, regardless of
    the number of arcs, are considered.
  </t>

  <t>
    Specifically, the routable path property is a corollary of the property
    that for all positive integers n and all distinct nodes X and Z, if
    there is any path from X to Z of n arcs or fewer, then there is a shortest
    path, from among those of n arcs or fewer, that is a routable path.
    This may be called the n-arc routable path property.
  </t>

  <t>
    The n-arc routable path property is trivial for n = 1 and directly
    follows from the definition of the MPRs of Z for n = 2.
  </t>

  <t>
    Proceeding by induction, assuming the n-arc routable path property
    is true for n = k, consider the case that n = k+1.
  </t>

  <t>
    Suppose that X - V1 - V2 - ... - Vk - Z is a shortest k+1 arc path
    from X to Z. We construct a path that has no more than k+1 arcs,
    has the same or shorter length (hence has the same, shortest, length
    considering only paths of up to k+1 arcs, by assumption), and is a
    routable path.
  </t>

  <t>
    First, consider whether Vk is an MPR of Z. If it is not, then consider
    the two-arc path Vk-1 - Vk - Z. This can be replaced either by a
    one-arc path Vk-1 - Z or by a two-arc path Vk-1 - Wk - Z, where Wk
    is an MPR of Z, such that the metric from Vk-1 to Z by the
    replacement path is no longer. In the former case (replacement one-arc
path), this now produces a path of length k, and the previous
    inductive step may be applied. In the latter case, we have replaced
    Vk by Wk, where Wk is an MPR of Z. Thus, we need only consider the
    case that Vk is an MPR of Z.
  </t>

  <t>
    We now apply the previous inductive step to the path X - V1 - ... - Vk-1 - Vk,
    replacing it by an equal length path X - W1 - ... Wm-1 - Vk, where m &lt;= k,
    where this path is a routable path. Then, because Vk is an MPR of Z, the path
    X - W1 - ... - Wm-1 - Vk - Z is a routable path and demonstrates the
    n-arc routable path property for n = k+1.
  </t>

  <t>
    This thus shows that for any distinct nodes X and Z, there is a routable
    path using the MPR-reduced topology from X to Z, i.e., that OLSRv2 finds
    minimum length paths (minimum total metric routes).
