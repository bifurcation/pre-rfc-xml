<abstract>
<t>
   Point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is designed to verify multipoint
   connectivity.  This document specifies the support of P2MP BFD in
   Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL).  Similar to TRILL point-to-point BFD, BFD Control packets in
   TRILL P2MP BFD are transmitted using RBridge Channel messages. This
   document updates RFCs 7175 and RFC 7177.</t>

<t>
   TRILL supports multicast forwarding.  Applications based on TRILL
   multicast may need quick detection of multicast failures using P2MP
   BFD <xref target="RFC8562"/>.  This document specifies TRILL support
   of P2MP BFD.</t>

	<t>
   To use P2MP BFD, the head end needs to periodically transmit BFD
   Control packets to all tails using TRILL multicast.  A new RBridge
   Channel message is allocated for this purpose.</t>

<t>In order to execute the global protection of distribution used for
multicast forwarding <xref target="TRILL-TREES"/>, the head needs
to track the active status of tails
<xref target="RFC8563"/>.  If the tail loses
connectivity as detected by not receiving the new RBridge Channel
message from the head, the tail should notify the head of the lack of
multipoint connectivity with unicast BFD Control packets.  These
unicast BFD Control packets are transmitted using the existing
RBridge Channel message assigned to BFD Control <xref target="RFC7175"/>.

   This document updates <xref target="RFC7177"/> as specified in <xref target="section-3"/> and updates
   <xref target="RFC7175"/> as specified in Sections <xref target="section-4" format="counter"/> and <xref target="section-5" format="counter"/>.</t>

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL

    when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

<t>Familiarity with <xref target="RFC6325"/>, <xref target="RFC7175"/>, and
<xref target="RFC7178"/> is assumed in this document.</t>

	<section title="Bootstrapping" anchor="section-3">
<t>
      The TRILL adjacency mechanism bootstraps the establishment of one-
      hop TRILL BFD sessions <xref target="RFC7177"/>. Multi-hop sessions are expected
      to be configured by the network manager. A slight wording update
      to the second sentence in Section 6 of <xref target="RFC7177"/> is required.</t>

<t>It currently reads:

<list><t>
      If an RBridge supports BFD <xref target="RFC7175"/>, it will have learned whether
      the other RBridge has BFD enabled by whether or not a BFD-Enabled
      TLV <xref target="RFC6213"/> was included in its Hellos.</t>
	</list>
	</t>

	<t>Now it should read:<list>
<t>
	If an RBridge supports BFD (see <xref target="RFC7175"/> and
	[RFC8564]), it will have 
      learned whether the other RBridge has BFD enabled by whether or
      not a BFD-Enabled TLV <xref target="RFC6213"/> was included in its Hellos.
	</t>
	</list>
	</t>

<t>
In addition, a normative reference to this document is added to RFC 7177 as a result of this update. 
</t>

	</section>

	<section title="A New RBridge Channel Message for P2MP BFD" anchor="section-4"><t>

   RBridge Channel protocol number 0x002 is defined for TRILL point-to-point BFD Control packets in <xref target="RFC7175"/>.  
   That RFC states that if
   the M bit of the TRILL Header of the RBridge Channel packet
   containing a BFD Control packet is nonzero, the packet is generally
   dropped.  In P2MP BFD, the head is required to probe tails using
   multicast.  This means the M bit will be set to 1.  For this reason,
   a new RBridge Channel message (P2MP BFD Control), whose protocol code point is 0x007, is
   specified in this document.  An RBridge that supports P2MP BFD MUST
   support the new RBridge Channel message for P2MP BFD. The capability
   to support the RBridge Channel message for P2MP BFD, and therefore
   support performing P2MP BFD, is announced within the RBridge Channel
   Protocols sub-TLV in Link State PDUs (LSPs) <xref target="RFC7176"/>.</t>

	<t>
   As specified in <xref target="RFC7178"/>, when the tail receives TRILL Data packets
   sent as BFD RBridge Channel messages, it will absorb the packets
   itself rather than deliver these packets to its attached end stations.
   </t>

	</section>

	<section title="Discriminators and Packet Demultiplexing" anchor="section-5"><t>
   The processing in Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC7175"/> generally applies except
   that the test on the M bit in the TRILL Header is reversed.  If the M
   bit is zero, the packet MUST be discarded.  If the M bit is one, it
   is processed.</t>

	<t>
   After the processing per Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC7175"/>, the tail demultiplexes
   incoming BFD packets based on a combination of the source address and
   My Discriminator as specified in <xref target="RFC8562"/>.  In
   addition to this combination, TRILL P2MP BFD requires that the tail
   use the Data Label, which is either the inner VLAN or the Fine-Grained
   Label <xref target="RFC7172"/>, for demultiplexing.  If the tail needs to
   notify the head about the failure of a multipath, the tail is
   required to send unicast BFD Control packets using the same Data
   Label as used by the head.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Tracking Active Tails" anchor="section-6"><t>
   According to <xref target="RFC8562"/>, the head has a session of
   type MultipointHead that is bound to a multipoint path.  Multipoint
   BFD Control packets are sent by this session over the multipoint
   path, and no BFD Control packets are received by it.  Each tail
   dynamically creates a MultipointTail per a multipoint path.
   MultipointTail sessions receive BFD Control packets from the head
   over multipoint paths.</t>

	<t>
   An example use is when a multicast tree root needs to keep track of
   all the receivers as in <xref target="TRILL-TREES"/>; this can be
   done by maintaining a session of type MultipointClient per receiver
   that is of interest, as described in <xref target="RFC8563"/>.  See <xref target="RFC8563"/> for detailed
   operations of tracking active tails.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="section-7"><t>
   Multipoint BFD provides its own authentication but does not provide
   encryption (see the Security Considerations in <xref target="RFC8562"/>). As specified in this document, the point-to-multipoint
   BFD payloads are encapsulated in RBridge Channel messages that have
   been extended by <xref target="RFC7978"/> to provide security. <xref target="RFC7978"/> provides
   encryption only for point-to-point extended RBridge Channel messages,
   so its encryption facilities are not applicable to this document.
   However, <xref target="RFC7978"/> provides stronger authentication than that
   currently provided in BFD. Thus, there is little reason to use the
   BFD security mechanisms if authentication per <xref target="RFC7978"/> is in use. It is
   expected that a future TRILL document will provide for group keying;
   when that occurs, the use of RBridge Channel security <xref target="RFC7978"/> will
   be able to provide both encryption and authentication.</t>

	<t>
   For general multipoint BFD security considerations, see
   <xref target="RFC8562"/>.</t>

	<t>
   For general RBridge Channel security considerations, see <xref target="RFC7178"/>.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="section-8"><t>
   IANA has allocated the following from the Standards Action <xref target="RFC8126"/> range
   of the "RBridge Channel Protocols" registry, which is part of the
   "Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Parameters" registry.</t>
