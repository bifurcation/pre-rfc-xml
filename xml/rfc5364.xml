In certain types of multimedia communications, a Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) request is distributed to a group of SIP User Agents
(UAs). The sender sends a single SIP request to a server which further
distributes the request to the group. This SIP request contains a list
of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), which identify the recipients
of the SIP request. This URI list is expressed as a resource list XML
document. This specification defines an XML extension to the XML
resource list format that allows the sender of the request to qualify
a recipient with a copy control level similar to the copy control
level of existing email systems.

<section title="Introduction">

<t>
<xref target="RFC5363">RFC 5363</xref> describes a generic framework for carrying Uniform
Resource Identifier (URI) lists in <xref target="RFC3261">SIP</xref>
messages. Specifically, the document provides a common framework for
specific implementations of URI-list services, such as <xref
target="RFC5366">conferences initiated
with INVITE requests</xref> or <xref
target="RFC5365">Multiple-recipient MESSAGE
requests</xref>.
</t>

<t>
Common to all URI-list services is the presence of a SIP request that
contains a collection of resources, typically expressed as an <xref
target="RFC4826">XML resource list
</xref>. SIP requests carrying resource lists can appear either in
requests received by the URI-list server, indicating the list of
intended recipients, or in each of the requests that the URI-list
server sends to recipients, indicating the list of recipients of the
same SIP request.
</t>
<t>
Although the <xref target="RFC4826">XML
resource list</xref> provides a powerful mechanism for describing
a list of resources, there is a need for a copy control attribute to
determine whether a resource is receiving a SIP request as a primary
recipient, a carbon copy, or a blind carbon copy. This is similar to
common email systems, where the sender can categorize each recipient
as a "to", "cc", or "bcc" recipient.
</t>
<t>
This document addresses this problem by providing an extension to the
<xref target="RFC4826">XML resource list</xref> that enables the
sender to supply a copy control attribute that labels each recipient
as a "to", "cc", or "bcc" recipient. This attribute indicates whether
the recipient is receiving a primary copy of the SIP request, a carbon
copy, or a blind carbon copy. Additionally, we provide the sender with
the capability of indicating in the URI list that one or more
resources should be anonymized, so that some recipients' URIs are not
disclosed to the other recipients. Instead, these URIs are replaced
with anonymous URIs.
</t>
<t>
The remainder of this document is organized as follows: <xref
target="sec-terminology" /> introduces the terminology used throughout
this specification. <xref target="sec-overview" /> gives an overview
of operation. <xref target="sec-uri-list-extension" /> formally
defines an extension to URI lists. The XML schema definition is
provided in <xref target="sec-xml-schema"/>. <xref
target="sec-examples" /> shows examples of the URI lists with the
extensions defined in this document. <xref
target="sec-carrying-uri-lists" /> discusses the implications of
carrying URI lists in SIP messages.

<t>
<xref target="fig-example-flow" /> depicts a general overview of the
operation of a URI-list server. A SIP User Agent Client (UAC) issuer
sends a SIP request (F1) to a URI-list server containing a recipient
list. The URI-list server generates a SIP request to each recipient,
according to the specific SIP method. Each of these SIP requests
contains a recipient-history list that indicates the visible list of
recipients of the SIP request.

<t>
The URI-list mechanism allows a sender to specify multiple targets for
a SIP request by including a recipient <xref target="RFC4826">XML
resource list</xref> in the body of the SIP request. This recipient
list includes the target URIs of the SIP request (the actual
procedures are method specific and outside the scope of this
document). Each target URI may also be marked with a copy control
attribute to indicate the copy level in which the recipient is
receiving the SIP request. This is achieved by the sender qualifying
each URI in the URI list with a 'copyControl' attribute. The available
values of the 'copyControl' attribute include "to", "cc", and "bcc"
(analogous to email).  This is discussed in greater detail in <xref
target="sec-uri-list-extension" />. When the URI-list server expands
the request to each recipient, the URI-list server includes a
recipient-history XML resource list built upon the recipient list
received from the sender. The recipient-history XML resource list
replaces the recipient list in the SIP requests generated by the
URI-list server towards each recipient. The URI-list server copies
from the recipient list those targets that are marked with the "to"
and "cc" copy control level, and pastes them in the recipient-history
list. The URI-list server explicitly excludes from the
recipient-history list those URIs marked with a "bcc" copy control,
although it is able to preserve the address of a "bcc" tagged URI when
it matches the URI of the recipient of the SIP request (this is
described later in <xref target="sec-uri-list-extension" />). When a
recipient receives the SIP request containing the recipient-history
XML resource list, he is able to determine which other visible
recipients are getting a copy of the SIP request, and whether they are
marked with the "to" or "cc" copy control level. Later, if needed, the
recipient can generate a reply to those visible recipients.
</t>
<t>
In addition to the 'copyControl' attribute for a URI in an XML
resource list, we define a second boolean attribute called
'anonymize'. The sender of a SIP request can mark a URI in a recipient
XML resource list with the 'anonymize' attribute to indicate the
URI-list server that the URI marked with that attribute is to be
replaced with an anonymous URI in the recipient-history XML resource
list. This provides knowledge to the recipients of a SIP request of
the number of additional visible recipients whose URIs have not been
disclosed.
</t>
<t>
There are cases when the sender marks several URIs with the
'anonymize' attribute. The URI-list server can group the anonymized
URIs in a single anonymized URI within its copy control level, and
provide a count of the number of anonymized URIs. To support this
scenario, we define a new 'count' attribute to a URI in the
recipient-history XML resource list. It is expected that the 'count'
attribute is only used with anonymous URIs, although syntactically it
is possible to add a 'count' attribute to any URI in any XML resource
list.
</t>
<t>
Initially, it may be thought that the 'anonymize' attribute overlaps
with the "bcc" value of the 'copyControl' attribute. However, there
are differences between them. If the sender qualifies a URI with a
'copyControl' attribute of "bcc" in the recipient XML resource list,
the URI-list server will typically remove that URI from the
recipient-history XML resource list (unless the URI-list server
decides to preserve a "bcc" marked URI when that URI is itself the
recipient of the SIP request). Recipients of the SIP request will not
notice that one or more extra "bcc" URIs also received the
request. However, if the sender qualifies a URI with the 'anonymize'
attribute in the recipient XML resource list, the URI-list server will
replace the URI with an anonymous one in the recipient-history
list. Recipients of the SIP request will notice that there have been
one or more additional recipients of the same request, but their URIs
are not disclosed.
</t>

<section title="Extension to the Resource List Data Format"
	 anchor="sec-uri-list-extension">

<t>
This document defines an extension to the <xref target="RFC4826">XML
resource list data format</xref> that allows the sender to indicate a
copy control attribute that qualifies a recipient with a copy control
level. We define a new 'copyControl' attribute to the &lt;entry&gt;
element of the <xref target="RFC4826">resource list document format
</xref>. The 'copyControl' attribute has similar semantics to the type
of destination address in email systems. It can take the values "to",
"cc", and "bcc". A "to" value of the 'copyControl' attribute indicates
that the resource is considered a primary recipient of the SIP
request. A "cc" value indicates that the resource receives a carbon
copy of the SIP request. A "bcc" value indicates that the resource
receives a blind carbon copy of the SIP request (i.e., this URI is not
disclosed to other recipients of the SIP request). The default
'copyControl' value is "bcc". That is, the absence of a 'copyControl'
attribute MUST be treated as if the 'copyControl' was set to "bcc".
</t>
<t>
When creating a recipient-history list, URI-list servers use "bcc"
'copyControl' attributes to route SIP requests. In addition, URI-list
servers behave similarly to <xref target="RFC2822">email systems
</xref> with respect to the treatment of these URIs marked with a
"bcc" copy control, because they have two ways of treating "bcc"
marked URIs. URI-list servers MUST treat these "bcc" marked URIs in
either of the following two ways:
</t>
<t>
  <list style='symbols'>
    <t>URI-list servers MUST remove all URIs marked with a "bcc" copy
    control in recipient-history lists. This mechanism allows URI-list
    servers to send the same recipient-history list to each recipient
    of the SIP request. However, recipients who are tagged with "bcc"
    values are not explicitly informed about it. </t>

    <t>URI-list servers MUST preserve with a "bcc" copy control in the
    recipient-history list the URI that identifies the recipient (if
    any) and MUST remove the remaining URIs marked with a "bcc" copy
    control. Consequently, each recipient receives a different
    recipient-history list. However, recipients who have been marked
    with a "bcc" copy control are explicitly informed about it.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
Implementations that are able to receive recipient-history lists must
pay attention to the contents of the list. If the recipient's URI is
not included in the recipient-history list or if it is included but tagged
with a "bcc" copy control, then implementations SHOULD prevent the
user from replying to all the recipients of the SIP request. This
would allow the non-blind recipients to notice the existence of blind
recipients of the SIP request.
</t>
<t>
A new 'anonymize' attribute can be included in a &lt;entry&gt; element
of the <xref target="RFC4826">resource list document format
</xref>. If set to a "true" value, it provides an indication to the
URI-list server for not disclosing the URI itself in a URI list sent
to the recipient, but instead to anonymize the URI (i.e., making it
bogus in the recipient-history XML resource list). URI-list servers
can use URIs tagged with the 'anonymize' attribute for routing SIP
requests, but MUST convert them to the SIP URI
"sip:anonymous@anonymous.invalid" in recipient-history lists. The
default value of the 'anonymize' attribute is "false".
</t>
<t>
There are occasions where the URI-list server encounters the same URI
entry duplicated in a resource list, where duplicated URI entries are
tagged with the same or different values of the 'copyControl'
attribute. There are no reasonable usages that justify duplicated URIs
in resource lists; thus, this is considered an error. URI-list servers
should not send duplicated copies of the same SIP request to the same
intended recipient. In case the URI-list server encounters the same
URI entry duplicated in a resource list, it should send at most a single
copy of the request to that intended recipient. For each set of
duplicated URI entries, the URI-list server MUST select the highest
precedence value of the 'copyControl' attribute for the same intended
recipient. The order of precedence of the values of the 'copyControl'
attribute is: "to", "cc", and "bcc". Once the URI-list server has
selected a value for the 'copyControl' attribute of an intended
recipient, the URI-list server can continue processing the request.
</t>
<t>
Processing of URIs tagged with a 'copyControl' attribute set to a
"bcc" value has higher precedence over the 'anonymize'
attribute. Thus, if the 'copyControl' of a URI is set to "bcc", the
URI-list server MUST remove that URI from the recipient-history list,
and the 'anonymize' attribute will be ignored. Therefore, the
'anonymize' attribute is only useful for those URIs tagged with a
'copyControl' of "to" or "cc".
</t>
<t>
A new 'count' attribute can be also included in an &lt;entry&gt;
element of the <xref target="RFC4826">
resource list document format</xref>. It provides the number of equal
URIs. Typically, recipient lists created by UACs will not have equal
(or duplicate) URI entries; thus, it is not expected to contain URIs
tagged with 'count' attributes. However, recipient-history lists can
contain duplicated anonymized URIs; therefore, it is expected that
recipient-history lists will contain 'count' attributes. The default
value of the 'count' attribute is "1".
</t>
<t>
The 'copyControl', 'anonymize', and 'count' attributes SHOULD be included
as modifiers of any of the child elements included in the
&lt;list&gt; element of a resource list (e.g., attribute of the
&lt;entry&gt; or &lt;external&gt; elements).
</t>

<t>
<xref target="sec-xml-schema" /> describes the format of the
'copyControl', 'anonymize', and 'count' attributes. Implementations
according to this specification MUST support this XML schema.
</t>

<t>
Implementations that receive recipient-history lists must
pay attention to the contents of the list. If the recipient's URI is
not included in recipient-history list or if it is included but tagged
with a "bcc" copy control, then they SHOULD prevent the
user from replying to all the recipients of the SIP request. This
would allow the non-blind recipients to notice the existence of blind
recipients in the original SIP request.

This section shows two examples of URI lists that can be included in

shows a recipient list that the UAC sends to the URI-list server. This

resources are also marked with the 'anonymize' attribute. This
provides an indication to the URI-list service for not disclosing

<t>
Upon receipt of the SIP request containing the recipient list of <xref
target="fig-sender-list" />, the URI-list server creates a SIP request
to each of the URIs listed in the recipient list (so, in our example,
it creates 7 SIP requests). The URI-list server processes the
recipient list and creates a recipient-history list that is included
in each of the outgoing SIP requests.  The process is as follows: the
URI-list server creates a new recipient-history list, based on the
recipient list, but with changes. First, it copies all the URIs
(&lt;entry&gt; elements) marked with the "to" or "cc" 'copyControl'
attributes, which do not contain an 'anonymize' attribute (or when the
'anonymize' attribute is set to "false"). Then all the URIs marked
with a 'copyControl' attribute set to "to" and 'anonymize' attribute
set to "true" are replaced with the SIP anonymous URI
"sip:anonymous@anonymous.invalid". In this entry, the URI-list server
also adds the original value of the 'copyControl' attribute ("to" in
our example), and it adds a 'count' attribute containing the number of
anonymous entries in this group ("2" in our example). Then the
URI-list server does the same operation to the URIs tagged with the
'copyControl' attribute set to "cc" and 'anonymize' attribute set to
"true", adding also the 'count' attribute containing the number of
anonymous attributes in this group ("1" in the example). Last, the
URI-list server removes all URIs marked with the
"bcc" 'copyControl' attribute. The resulting recipient-history list is
shown in <xref target="fig-recipients-list" />.

<section title="Carrying URI Lists in SIP"
	 anchor="sec-carrying-uri-lists">

<t>
A SIP UAC (User Agent Client) that composes a SIP request can include
a URI list with the extensions specified in this document to indicate
the list of intended recipients. On doing so, as specified in
<xref target="RFC5363">RFC 5363</xref>, the UAC adds a <xref target="RFC2183">Content-Disposition</xref> header field set to the
value 'recipient-list'. Typically UACs send these 'recipient-list'
bodies to URI-list services (this corresponds to flow F1 in <xref
target="fig-example-flow" />).  A body whose Content-Disposition type
is 'recipient-list' contains a URI list that includes the intended
recipients of the SIP request, something known throughout this
document as a recipient list. The &lt;entry&gt; element in the
URI list MAY also include a 'copyControl' and 'anonymize' attributes,
as specified in <xref target="sec-uri-list-extension" />.
</t>
<t>
To be able to inform intended recipients of who else is receiving a
copy of the SIP request, we define a new mail disposition type to be
included in a <xref target="RFC2183">Content-Disposition</xref>
header field of a SIP request. The value of this new disposition type
is 'recipient-list-history' and its purpose is to indicate a list of
recipients that a SIP request was sent to, something known throughout
this document as a recipient-history list. A body whose
Content-Disposition type is 'recipient-list-history' contains a
URI list with the visible (including anonymized) recipients of the SIP
request. The &lt;entry&gt; element in the URI list MAY also include a
'copyControl' and 'count' attributes, as specified in <xref
target="sec-uri-list-extension" />.
</t>
<t>
On sending a SIP request that contains a recipient-history list, if
the intended recipient does not support this specification, the SIP
request should not fail.  In order to ensure successful receipt of the
SIP requests that include 'recipient-list-history' bodies, User Agents
(such as URI-list servers) that build SIP requests with the
Content-Disposition header field set to 'recipient-list-history'
SHOULD add a <xref target="RFC3204">"handling" parameter</xref> set
to "optional".  Otherwise, the SIP request could fail and never be
received by the intended recipient.
</t>
<t>
Even though <xref target="SIP_BODY">"Message Body
Handling in SIP"</xref> mandates support for multipart bodies, legacy
recipients may not support them. In such a case, if the request sent
by the relay to the recipient needs to contain another body (e.g., a
MESSAGE request carrying a message in its body), the relay will not be
able to use this extension because the recipient would not be able to
process a multipart body with the original body plus the
'recipient-list-history' body.
</t>

<section title="Security Considerations"
anchor="sec-security">
<t>
<xref target="RFC5363">RFC 5363</xref> discusses
issues related to SIP URI-list services. Implementations of this
specification MUST follow the security-related rules in <xref
target="RFC5363">RFC 5363</xref>.
These rules include opt-in lists and
mandatory authentication and authorization of clients.
</t>
<t>
User Agent Clients SHOULD NOT hand SIP requests containing URI-list
services to unauthenticated and untrusted parties. This is to avoid
man-in-the-middle attacks or acquiring URI lists for performing spam
attacks. 
</t>
<t>
URI lists may contain private information, such as SIP URIs. It is
therefore not desirable that these URI lists are known by third
parties. Eavesdroppers are able to watch URI lists contained in SIP
requests unless the SIP message is sent over a secured channel, by
using any of the available SIP mechanisms, such as <xref
target="RFC4346">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</xref>, or unless the
URI-list body itself is encrypted with, e.g., <xref
target="RFC3851">S/MIME</xref>. Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that
URI-list bodies are encrypted with <xref
target="RFC3851">S/MIME</xref> or that the SIP request is encrypted
with <xref target="RFC4346">TLS</xref> or any other suitable
encryption mechanism.
</t>
<t>
Note that this URI list does not indicate the actual participants in the
session. It indicates only the URIs invited and that might accept the
request. It does not assert that these parties actually exist, that
they are reachable at the given URI, or that they have accepted the
invitation. No inferences about billing should be made from this
information. It is subject to spoofing by loading the list with
falsified content.
</t>
<t>
Issuers of SIP request use the "bcc" copy control attribute described
in <xref target="sec-uri-list-extension"/> to facilitate sending SIP
requests to recipients without revealing the URIs of one or more
of the other recipients. Mishandling this use of "bcc"
copy control has implications for confidential information that might
be revealed, which could eventually lead to security problems through
knowledge of even the existence of a particular URI. For example, if
using the first method described in <xref
target="sec-uri-list-extension"/>, where the "bcc" tagged URIs are
removed from the recipient-history list, blind recipients have no
explicit indication that they have been sent a blind copy of the SIP
request, except insofar as their URI does not appear in the
recipient-history list.  Because of this, one of the blind URIs could
potentially send a reply to all of the shown recipients and
accidentally reveal that the message went to the blind recipient.
When the second method from <xref target="sec-uri-list-extension"/> is
used, the blind recipient's address appears in the recipient-history
list of a separate copy of the list. If the "bcc" tagged URI sent
contains all of the "bcc" tagged URIs, all of the "bcc" recipients
will be seen by each "bcc" recipient.  Even if a separate message is
sent to each "bcc" recipient with only the individual's URI,
implementations still need to be careful to process replies to the
message as per <xref target="sec-uri-list-extension"/> so as not to
accidentally reveal the blind recipient to other recipients.
