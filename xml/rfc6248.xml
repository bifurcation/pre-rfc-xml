    <abstract>
      <t>This memo reclassifies RFC 4148, "IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)
      Metrics Registry", as Obsolete, and withdraws the IANA IPPM Metrics
      Registry itself from use because it is obsolete. The current registry
      structure has been found to be insufficiently detailed to uniquely
      identify IPPM metrics. Despite apparent efforts to find current or even
      future users, no one responded to the call for interest in the RFC 4148
      registry during the second half of 2010.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) framework <xref target="RFC2330" />
      describes several ways to record options and metric parameter settings,
      in order to account for sources of measurement variability. For example,
      Section 13 of <xref target="RFC2330" /> describes the notion of "Type P"
      so that metrics can be specified in general, but the specifics (such as
      payload length in octets and protocol type) can replace P to
      disambiguate the results.</t>

      <t>When the IPPM Metrics Registry <xref target="RFC4148" /> was
      designed, the variability of the "Type P" notion, and the variability
      possible with the many metric parameters (see Section 4.2 of <xref
      target="RFC2679" />), were not fully appreciated.
      Further, some of the early metric definitions only
      indicate Poisson streams <xref target="RFC2330" /> (see the metrics in
      <xref target="RFC2679" />, <xref target="RFC2680" />, and <xref
      target="RFC3393" />), but later work standardized the methods for
      Periodic Stream measurements <xref target="RFC3432" />, adding to the
      variability possible when characterizing a metric exactly.</t>

      <t>It is not believed to be feasible or even useful to register every
      possible combination of Type P, metric parameters, and Stream parameters
      using the current structure of the IPPM Metrics Registry.</t>

      <t>The IPPM Metrics Registry is believed to have very few users, if any.
      Evidence of this was provided by the fact that one registry entry was
      syntactically incorrect for months after <xref target="RFC5644" /> was
      published. The text ":=" was used for the metrics in that document
      instead of "::=". It took eight months before someone offered that a
      parser found the error. Even the original registry author agrees that
      the current registry is not efficient, and has submitted a proposal to
      effectively create a new registry.</t>

      <t>Despite apparent efforts to find current or even future users, no one
      responded to the call for interest in the RFC 4148 registry during the
      second half of 2010. Therefore, the IETF now declares the registry
      Obsolete without any further reservations.</t>

      <t>When a registry is designated Obsolete, it simply prevents the IANA
      from registering new objects, in this case new metrics. So, even if a
      registry user was eventually found, they could continue to use the
      current registry, and its contents will continue to be available.</t>

      <t>The most recently published memo that added metrics to the registry
      is <xref target="RFC6049" />. This memo updates all previous memos that
      registered new metrics, including <xref target="RFC4737" /> and <xref
      target="RFC5560" />, so that the registry's Obsolete status will be
      evident.</t>

    <section title="Action to Reclassify RFC 4148 and the Corresponding IANA Registry as Obsolete">
      <t>Due to the ambiguities between the current metrics registrations and
      the metrics used, and the apparent minimal adoption of the registry in
      practice, it is required that:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>the IETF reclassify <xref target="RFC4148" /> as Obsolete.</t>

          <t>the IANA withdraw the current IPPM Metrics Registry from further
          updates and note that it too is Obsolete.</t>
        </list>It is assumed that parties who wish to establish a replacement
      registry function will work to specify such a registry.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This memo and its recommendations have no known impact on the
      security of the Internet (especially if there is a zombie apocalypse on
      the day it is published; humans will have many more security issues to
      worry about stemming from the rise of the un-dead).</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>Metrics defined in the IETF have been typically registered in the
      IANA IPPM Metrics Registry as described in the initial version of the
      registry <xref target="RFC4148" />. However, areas for improvement of
      this registry have been identified, and the registry structure has to be
      revisited when there is working group consensus to do so.</t>

      <t>The current consensus is to designate the IPPM Metrics Registry,
      originally described in <xref target="RFC4148" />, as Obsolete.</t>

      <t>The DESCRIPTION of the registry MIB has been modified as follows, and
      the first two sentences should be included on any IANA-maintained web
      page describing this registry or its contents:</t>

      <t>DESCRIPTION</t>

      <list style="empty">
        <t>"With the approval and publication of RFC 6248, this module is
        designated Obsolete.</t>

        <t>The registry will no longer be updated, and the current contents
        will be maintained as-is on the day that RFC 6248 was published.</t>

        <t>The original Description text follows below:</t>

        <t>This module defines a registry for IP Performance Metrics.</t>

        <t>...&nbsp;"</t>
      </list>
