      <t>This document defines the procedures that the Internet Assigned
      Numbers Authority (IANA) uses when handling assignment and other
      requests related to the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number
      registry. It also discusses the rationale and principles behind these
      procedures and how they facilitate the long-term sustainability of the
      registry.</t>

      <t>This document updates IANA's procedures by obsoleting the 
      previous UDP and TCP port assignment procedures defined in 
      Sections 8 and 9.1 of the IANA Allocation Guidelines, 
      and it updates the IANA service name and port assignment 
      procedures for UDP-Lite, the Datagram Congestion Control
      Protocol (DCCP), and the Stream Control
      Transmission Protocol (SCTP). It also updates the DNS SRV specification to 
      clarify what a service name is and how it is registered.</t>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>For many years, the assignment of new service names and port number
      values for use with the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) <xref
      target="RFC0793"></xref> and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) <xref
      target="RFC0768"></xref> has had less than clear guidelines. New
      transport protocols have been added -- the Stream Control Transmission
      Protocol (SCTP) <xref target="RFC4960"></xref> and the Datagram
      Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) <xref target="RFC4342"></xref> -- and
      new mechanisms like DNS SRV records <xref target="RFC2782"></xref> have
      been developed, each with separate registries and separate guidelines.
      The community also recognized the need for additional procedures beyond
      just assignment; notably modification, revocation, and release.</t>

      <t>A key element of the procedural streamlining specified in this
      document is to establish identical assignment procedures for all IETF
      transport protocols. This document brings the IANA procedures for TCP
      and UDP in line with those for SCTP and DCCP, resulting in a single
      process that requesters and IANA follow for all requests for all
      transport protocols, including future protocols not yet defined.</t>

      <t>In addition to detailing the IANA procedures for the initial
      assignment of service names and port numbers, this document also
      specifies post-assignment procedures that until now have been handled in
      an ad hoc manner. These include procedures to de-assign a port number
      that is no longer in use, to take a port number assigned for one
      service that is no longer in use and reuse it for another service, and the
      procedure by which IANA can unilaterally revoke a prior port number
      assignment. <xref target="iana-procedures"></xref> discusses the
      specifics of these procedures and processes that requesters and IANA
      follow for all requests for all current and future transport
      protocols.</t>

      <t>IANA is the authority for assigning service names and port numbers.
      The registries that are created to store these assignments are
      maintained by IANA. For protocols developed by IETF working groups, IANA
      now also offers a method for the "early assignment" <xref
      target="RFC4020"></xref> of service names and port numbers, as described
      in <xref target="assignment"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document updates IANA's procedures for UDP and TCP port numbers
      by obsoleting Sections 8 and 9.1 of the IANA Allocation Guidelines <xref
      target="RFC2780"></xref>. (Note that other sections of the IANA Allocation Guidelines, relating to the protocol field values in IPv4
      headers, were also updated in February 2008 <xref
      target="RFC5237"></xref>.) This document also updates the IANA
      assignment procedures for DCCP <xref target="RFC4340"></xref> 
	  <xref target="RFC5595"></xref> and SCTP
      <xref target="RFC4960"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The Lightweight User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite) shares the port space
      with UDP. The UDP-Lite specification <xref target="RFC3828"></xref> says:
      "UDP-Lite uses the same set of port number values
      assigned by the IANA for use by UDP". An update of the UDP procedures
      therefore also results in a corresponding update of the UDP-Lite procedures.</t>

      <t>This document also clarifies what a service name is and how it is
      assigned. This will impact the DNS SRV specification <xref
      target="RFC2782"></xref>, because that specification merely makes a
      brief mention that the symbolic names of services are defined in
      "Assigned Numbers" <xref target="RFC1700"></xref>, without stating to
      which section it refers within that 230-page document. The DNS SRV
      specification may have been referring to the list of Port Assignments
      (known as /etc/services on Unix), or to the "Protocol And Service Names"
      section, or to both, or to some other section. Furthermore, "Assigned
      Numbers" <xref target="RFC1700"/> has been obsoleted <xref target="RFC3232"></xref> and has been
      replaced by on-line registries <xref target="PORTREG"></xref> <xref
      target="PROTSERVREG"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The development of new transport protocols is a major effort that the
      IETF does not undertake very often. If a new transport protocol is
      standardized in the future, it is expected to follow these guidelines and practices around using service names
      and port numbers as
      much as possible, for consistency.</t>

<t>
  At the time of writing of this document, the internal procedures of "Expert Review"
  teams, including that of IANA's port review team, are not documented in
  any RFC and this document doesn't change that.
</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="motivation" title="Motivation">
      <t>Information about the assignment procedures for the port registry
      has existed in three locations: the forms for requesting port number
      assignments on the IANA web site <xref target="SYSFORM"></xref> <xref
      target="USRFORM"></xref>, an introductory text section in the file
      listing the port number assignments themselves (known as the port numbers registry) <xref
      target="PORTREG"></xref>, and two brief sections of the IANA Allocation
      Guidelines <xref target="RFC2780"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Similarly, the procedures surrounding service names have been
      historically unclear. Service names were originally created as mnemonic
      identifiers for port numbers without a well-defined syntax, apart from the
      14-character limit mentioned on the IANA website <xref
      target="SYSFORM"></xref> <xref target="USRFORM"></xref>. Even that
      length limit has not been consistently applied, and some assigned
      service names are 15 characters long. When service identification via
      DNS SRV Resource Records (RRs) was introduced <xref target="RFC2782"></xref>,
      it became useful to start assigning service names alone, and because IANA
      had no procedure for assigning a service name without an
      associated port number, this led to the creation of an informal temporary service name registry outside of the
      control of IANA, which now
      contains roughly 500 service names <xref target="SRVREG"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document aggregates all this scattered information into a single
      reference that aligns and clearly defines the management procedures for
      both service names and port numbers. It gives more detailed guidance to
      prospective requesters of service names and ports than the existing
      documentation, and it streamlines the IANA procedures for the management
      of the registry, so that requests can be completed in a timely manner.</t>

      <t>This document defines rules for assignment of service names without
      associated port numbers, for such usages as DNS SRV records <xref
      target="RFC2782"></xref>, which was not possible under the previous IANA
      procedures. The document also merges service name assignments from the
      non-IANA ad hoc registry <xref target="SRVREG"></xref> and from the IANA
      Protocol and Service Names registry <xref target="PROTSERVREG"></xref>
      into the IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number registry
      <xref target="PORTREG"></xref>, which from here on is the single
      authoritative registry for service names and port numbers.</t>

      <t>An additional purpose of this document is to describe the principles
      that guide the IETF and IANA in their role as the long-term joint
      stewards of the service name and port number registry. TCP and UDP have
      had remarkable success over the last decades. Thousands of applications
      and application-level protocols have service names and port numbers assigned
      for their use, and there is every reason to believe that this trend will
      continue into the future. It is hence extremely important that
      management of the registry follow principles that ensure its long-term
      usefulness as a shared resource. <xref target="principles"></xref>
      discusses these principles in detail.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="background" title="Background">
      <t>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) <xref
      target="RFC0793"></xref> and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) <xref
      target="RFC0768"></xref> have enjoyed a remarkable success over the
      decades as the two most widely used transport protocols on the Internet.
      They have relied on the concept of "ports" as logical entities for
      Internet communication. Ports serve two purposes: first, they provide a
      demultiplexing identifier to differentiate transport sessions between
      the same pair of endpoints, and second, they may also identify the
      application protocol and associated service to which processes connect.
      Newer transport protocols, such as the Stream Control Transmission
      Protocol (SCTP) <xref target="RFC4960"></xref> and the Datagram
      Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) <xref target="RFC4342"></xref>, have
      also adopted the concept of ports for their communication sessions and
      use 16-bit port numbers in the same way as TCP and UDP (and
      UDP-Lite <xref target="RFC3828"></xref>, a variant of UDP).</t>

      <t>Port numbers are the original and most widely used means for
      application and service identification on the Internet. Ports are
      16-bit numbers, and the combination of source and destination port
      numbers together with the IP addresses of the communicating end systems
      uniquely identifies a session of a given transport protocol. Port
      numbers are also known by their associated service names such as
      "telnet" for port number 23 and "http" (as well as "www" and "www&nbhy;http")
      for port number 80.</t>

      <t>All involved parties -- hosts running services, hosts accessing services on other hosts, and
      intermediate devices (such as firewalls and NATs) that restrict services --
      need to agree on which service corresponds to a particular destination
      port. Although this is ultimately a local decision with meaning only
      between the endpoints of a connection, it is common for many services to
      have a default port upon which those servers usually listen, when
      possible, and these ports are recorded by the Internet Assigned Numbers
      Authority (IANA) through the service name and port number registry <xref
      target="PORTREG"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Over time, the assumption that a particular port number necessarily
      implies a particular service may become less true. For example, multiple
      instances of the same service on the same host cannot generally listen
      on the same port, and multiple hosts behind the same NAT gateway cannot
      all have a mapping for the same port on the external side of the NAT
      gateway, whether using static port mappings configured by hand by the
      user, or dynamic port mappings configured automatically using a port
      mapping protocol like the <xref target="NAT-PMP">NAT Port
      Mapping Protocol</xref> or <xref target="IGD">Internet
      Gateway Device</xref>.</t>

      <t>Applications may use port numbers directly, look up port
      numbers based on service names via system calls such as getservbyname()
      on UNIX, look up port numbers by performing queries for DNS SRV records
      <xref target="RFC2782"></xref> <xref
      target="DNS-SD"></xref>, or determine port numbers
      in a variety of other ways like the TCP Port Service Multiplexer
      (TCPMUX) <xref target="RFC1078"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Designers of applications and application-level protocols may apply
      to IANA for an assigned service name and port number for a specific
      application, and may -- after assignment -- assume that no
      other application will use that service name or port number for its
      communication sessions. Application designers also have the option of
      requesting only an assigned service name without a corresponding fixed port number if their application does not
      require one, such as applications that use DNS     
SRV records to
      look up port numbers dynamically at run-time. Because the
port number space is finite (and therefore conservation
is an important goal), the alternative of using service names instead of port numbers is RECOMMENDED whenever possible.

    <section anchor="term" title="Conventions Used in This Document">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in "Key words for use in
      RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>

	<t>This document uses the term "assignment" to refer to the procedure
	by which IANA provides service names and/or port numbers to requesting
	parties; other RFCs refer to this as "allocation" or "registration".
	This document assumes that all these terms have the same meaning, and
will use terms other than "assignment" only when quoting from or referring to text in these other documents.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="srvname" title="Service Names">
      <t>Service names are the unique key in the Service Name and Transport
      Protocol Port Number registry. This unique symbolic name for a service
      may also be used for other purposes, such as in <xref
      target="RFC2782">DNS SRV records</xref>. Within the registry, this
      unique key ensures that different services can be unambiguously
      distinguished, thus preventing name collisions and avoiding confusion
      about who is the Assignee for a particular entry.</t>

      <t>There may be more than one service name associated with a particular
      transport protocol and port. There are three ways that such port number
      overloading can occur: <list style="symbols">
          <t>Overloading occurs when one service is an extension of another
          service, and an in-band mechanism exists for determining if the
          extension is present or not. One example is port 3478, which has the
          service name aliases "stun" and "turn". Traversal Using
          Relays around NAT (TURN) <xref
          target="RFC5766"></xref> is an extension to the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) <xref
          target="RFC5389"></xref> service. TURN-enabled clients wishing to
          locate TURN servers could attempt to discover "stun" services and
          then check in-band if the server also supports TURN, but this would be
          inefficient. Enabling them to directly query for "turn" servers by
          name is a better approach. (Note that TURN servers in this case
          should also be locatable via a "stun" discovery, because every TURN
          server is also a STUN server.)</t>

          <t>By historical accident, the service name "http" has two synonyms
          "www" and "www-http". When used in SRV records <xref
          target="RFC2782"></xref> and similar service discovery mechanisms,
          only the service name "http" should be used, not these additional
          names. If a
          server were to advertise "www", it would not be discovered by
          clients browsing for "http". Advertising or browsing for the aliases
          as well as the primary service name is inefficient, and
          achieves nothing that is not already achieved by using the service
          name "http" exclusively.</t>

          <t>As indicated in this document in 
          <xref target="consistency"></xref>, overloading has been used to
          create replacement	
          names that are consistent with the	
          syntax this document prescribes for legacy names that do not conform 
          to this syntax already. For such cases, only the	
          new name should be used in SRV records, to avoid	
          the same issues as with historical cases of multiple names,	
          and also because the legacy names are incompatible with	
          SRV record use.</t>

        </list>
        
Assignment requests for new names for existing registered services will be rejected, as a result.
      Implementers are requested to inform IANA if they discover other cases
      where a single service has multiple names, so that one name may be
      recorded as the primary name for service discovery purposes.</t>

      <t>Service names are assigned on a "first come, first served" basis, as
      described in <xref target="assignment"></xref>. Names should be brief
      and informative, avoiding words or abbreviations that are redundant in
      the context of the registry (e.g., "port", "service", "protocol", etc.)
      Names referring to discovery services, e.g., using multicast or
      broadcast to identify endpoints capable of a given service, SHOULD use
      an easily identifiable suffix (e.g., "-disc").</t>

      <section anchor="sec-syntax" title="Service Name Syntax">
        <t>Valid service names are hereby normatively defined as follows: 
        <list style="symbols">
            <t>MUST be at least 1 character and no more than 15 characters
            long</t>

            <t>MUST contain only US-ASCII <xref
            target="ANSI.X3.4-1986"></xref> letters 'A' - 'Z' and 'a' - 'z',
            digits '0' - '9', and hyphens ('-', ASCII 0x2D or decimal 45)</t>

            <t>MUST contain at least one letter ('A' - 'Z' or 'a' - 'z')</t>

            <t>MUST NOT begin or end with a hyphen</t>
            
            <t>hyphens MUST NOT be adjacent to other hyphens</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The reason for requiring at least one letter is to avoid service
        names like "23" (could be confused with a numeric port) or
        "6000-6063" (could be confused with a numeric port range).
        Although service names may contain both upper-case and lower-case
        letters, case is ignored for comparison purposes, so both "http" and
        "HTTP" denote the same service.</t>

        <t>Service names are purely opaque identifiers, and no semantics are
        implied by any superficial structure that a given service name may
        appear to have. For example, a company called "Example" may choose to
        register service names "Example-Foo" and "Example-Bar" for its "Foo"
        and "Bar" products, but the "Example" company cannot claim to "own" all
        service names beginning with "Example-"; they cannot prevent someone
        else from registering "Example-Baz" for a different service, and they cannot
        prevent other developers from using the "Example-Foo" and
        "Example-Bar" service types in order to interoperate with the "Foo"
        and "Bar" products. Technically speaking, in service discovery
        protocols, service names are merely a series of byte values on the
        wire; for the mnemonic convenience of human developers, it can be
        convenient to interpret those byte values as human-readable ASCII
        characters, but software should treat them as purely opaque
        identifiers and not attempt to parse them for any additional embedded
        meaning.</t>

<t>
   As of August 5, 2009, approximately 98% of the so-called "Short
   Names" <xref target="SYSFORM" /> <xref target="USRFORM" /> for existing port number assignments
   <xref target="PORTREG"/> already met the rules for legal service names stated in
   <xref target="assignment"/>, and hence for these services their service name is
   exactly the same as their historical "Short Name".  In approximately
   2% of cases, the new "service name" is derived based on the old

        <t>The DNS SRV specification <xref target="RFC2782"></xref> states
        that the Service Label part of the owner name of a DNS SRV record
        includes a "Service" element, described as "the symbolic name of the

    <section anchor="types" title="Port Number Ranges">
      <t>TCP, UDP, UDP-Lite, SCTP, and DCCP use 16-bit namespaces for
      their port number registries. The port registries for all of these
      transport protocols are subdivided into three ranges of numbers <xref target="RFC1340"/>, and
      <xref target="variances"></xref> describes the IANA procedures for each
      range in detail: <list style="symbols">
          <t>the System Ports, also known as the Well Known Ports, from 0-1023
          (assigned by IANA)</t>

          <t>the User Ports, also known as the Registered Ports, from
          1024-49151 (assigned by IANA)</t>

          <t>the Dynamic Ports, also known as the Private or Ephemeral Ports, from
          49152-65535 (never assigned)</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Of the assignable port ranges (System Ports and User Ports, i.e.,
      port numbers 0-49151), individual port numbers are in one of three
      states at any given time:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Assigned: Assigned port numbers are currently assigned to the
          service indicated in the registry.</t>

          <t>Unassigned: Unassigned port numbers are currently available for
          assignment upon request, as per the procedures outlined in this
          document.</t>

          <t>Reserved: Reserved port numbers are not available for regular
          assignment; they are "assigned to IANA" for special purposes.
          Reserved port numbers include values at the edges of each range,
          e.g., 0, 1023, 1024, etc., which may be used to extend these ranges
          or the overall port number space in the future.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In order to keep the size of the registry manageable, IANA typically
      only records the Assigned and Reserved service names and port numbers in
      the registry. Unassigned values are typically not explicitly listed.
      (There are very many Unassigned service names and
      enumerating them all would not be practical.)</t>

      <t>As a data point, when this document was written, approximately 76% of
      the TCP and UDP System Ports were assigned, and approximately 9% of the
      User Ports were assigned. (As noted, Dynamic Ports are never
      assigned.)</t>

      <section anchor="udptcpexp"
               title="Service Names and Port Numbers for Experimentation">
        <t>Of the System Ports, two TCP and UDP port numbers (1021 and 1022),
        together with their respective service names ("exp1" and "exp2"), have
        been assigned for experimentation with new applications and
        application-layer protocols that require a port number in the assigned
        ports range <xref target="RFC4727"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Please refer to Sections 1 and 1.1 of "Assigning Experimental and
        Testing Numbers Considered Useful" <xref target="RFC3692"></xref> for
        how these experimental port numbers are to be used.</t>

        <t>This document assigns the same two service names and port numbers
        for experimentation with new application-layer protocols over SCTP and
        DCCP in <xref target="sctpdccpexp"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Unfortunately, it can be difficult to limit access to these ports.
        Users SHOULD take measures to ensure that experimental ports are
        connecting to the intended process. For example, users of these
        experimental ports might include a 64-bit nonce, once on each segment
        of a message-oriented channel (e.g., UDP), or once at the beginning of
        a byte-stream (e.g., TCP), which is used to confirm that the port is
        being used as intended. Such confirmation of intended use is
        especially important when these ports are associated with privileged
        (e.g., system or administrator) processes.</t>

    <section anchor="principles"
             title="Principles for Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry Management">
      <t>Management procedures for the Service Name and Transport Protocol
      Port Number registry include assignment of service names and port
      numbers upon request, as well as management of information about
      existing assignments. The latter includes maintaining contact and
      description information about assignments, revoking abandoned
      assignments, and redefining assignments when needed. Of these
      procedures, careful port number assignment is most critical, in order to
      continue to conserve the remaining port numbers.</t>

      <t>As noted earlier, only about 9% of the User Port space is currently
      assigned. The current rate of assignment is approximately 400 ports per
      year, and has remained steady for the past 8 years. At that rate, if
      similar conservation continues, this resource will sustain another 85
      years of assignment - without the need to resort to reassignment of
      released values or revocation. The namespace available for service names
      is much larger, which allows for simpler management procedures.</t>

      <section title="Past Principles">
        <t>The principles for service
        name and port number management are based on the recommendations
		of the IANA "Expert Review" team. Until recently, that team followed a set of informal guidelines
		developed based on the review experience from previous assignment requests. These original guidelines,
		although informal, had never been publicly documented.
		They are recorded here for historical purposes only; the current  guidelines are described in <xref target="upprinc"></xref>.
		These guidelines previously were:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>TCP and UDP ports were simultaneously assigned when either was
            requested</t>

            <t>Port numbers were the primary assignment; service names were
            informative only, and did not have a well-defined syntax</t>

            <t>Port numbers were conserved informally, and sometimes
            inconsistently (e.g., some services were assigned ranges of many
            port numbers even where not strictly necessary)</t>

            <t>SCTP and DCCP service name and port number registries were
            managed separately from the TCP/UDP registries</t>

            <t>Service names could not be assigned in the old ports registry
            without assigning an associated port number at the same time</t>
          </list> 
</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="upprinc" title="Updated Principles">
        <t>This section summarizes the current principles by which IANA both handles
        the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number registry and
        attempts to conserve the port number space. This description is
        intended to inform applicants requesting service names and port
        numbers. 
        IANA has flexibility beyond these principles 
        when handling assignment requests; other factors may come into play, 
        and exceptions may be made to best serve the needs of the Internet.
        Applicants should be aware that IANA decisions are not required to be bound to these principles. These principles and general advice to users on port use are expected to change over time.</t>

        <t>IANA strives to assign service names that do not request an
        associated port number assignment under a simple "First Come First
        Served" policy <xref target="RFC5226"></xref>. IANA MAY, at its
        discretion, refer service name requests to "Expert Review" in cases of
        mass assignment requests or other situations where IANA believes "Expert
        Review" is advisable <xref target="RFC5226"/>; use of the "Expert Review"
		helps advise IANA informally in cases where "IETF Review" or
"IESG Approval"
		is used, as with most IETF protocols.</t>

        <t>The basic principle of service name and port number registry
        management is to conserve use of the port space where possible.
        Extensions to support larger port number spaces would require changing
        many core protocols of the current Internet in a way that would not be
        backward compatible and interfere with both current and legacy
        applications.</t>

        <t>Conservation of the port number space is required because this
        space is a limited resource, so applications are expected to
        participate in the traffic demultiplexing process where feasible. The
        port numbers are expected to encode as little information as possible that will
        <?rfc needLines="18" ?>
        still enable an application to perform further
        demultiplexing by itself. In particular, the principles form a goal that IANA strives to achieve 
		for new applications (with exceptions as deemed appropriate, especially as for
		extensions to legacy services) as follows:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>IANA strives to assign only one assigned port number per service or
            application.

<vspace blankLines="1"/>
Note: At the time of writing of this document, there is no IETF consensus
on when it is appropriate to use a second port for an insecure version of
a protocol.
</t>

            <t>IANA strives to assign only one assigned port number for all
            variants of a service (e.g., for updated versions of a service).</t>
			
	    <t>IANA strives to encourage the deployment of secure protocols.</t>			

            <t>IANA strives to assign only one assigned port number for all
            different types of devices using or participating in the same
            service.</t>

            <t>IANA strives to assign port numbers only for the transport
            protocol(s) explicitly named in an assignment request.</t>

            <t>IANA may recover unused port numbers, via the new procedures of
            de-assignment, revocation, and transfer.</t>
          </list> 

	Where possible, a given service is expected to demultiplex
        messages if necessary. For example, applications and protocols are
        expected to include in-band version information, so that future
        versions of the application or protocol can share the same assigned
        port. Applications and protocols are also expected to be able to
        efficiently use a single assigned port for multiple sessions, either
        by demultiplexing multiple streams within one port or by using the
        assigned port to coordinate using dynamic ports for subsequent
        exchanges (e.g., in the spirit of FTP <xref target="RFC0959"></xref>).</t>

        <t>Ports are used in various ways, notably:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>as endpoint process identifiers</t>

            <t>as application protocol identifiers</t>

            <t>for firewall-filtering purposes</t>

          </list> Both the process-identifier and the protocol-identifier uses
        suggest that anything a single process can demultiplex, or that can be
        encoded into a single protocol, should be. The firewall-filtering use
        suggests that some uses that could be multiplexed or encoded could
        instead be separated to allow for easier firewall management. Note
        that this latter use is much less sound, because port numbers have
        meaning only for the two endpoints involved in a connection, and
        drawing conclusions about the service that generated a given flow
        based on observed port numbers is not always reliable. </t>

        <t>Effective with the publication of this document, IANA will begin assigning port numbers for only those transport
        protocols explicitly included in an assignment request. This ends the
        long-standing practice of automatically assigning a port number to an
        application for both TCP and UDP, even if the request is for only
        one of these transport protocols. The new assignment procedure
        conserves resources by assigning a port number to an application for
        only those transport protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP, and/or DCCP) it
        actually uses. The port number will be marked as Reserved -- instead of
        Assigned -- in the port number registries of the other transport
        protocols. When applications start supporting the use of some of those
        additional transport protocols, the Assignee for the
        assignment MUST request that IANA convert these reserved ports into
        assignments. An application MUST NOT assume that it can use a
        port number assigned to it for use with one transport protocol with
        another transport protocol without IANA converting the
        reservation into an assignment.</t>

        <t>When the available pool of unassigned numbers has run out in a
        port range, it will be necessary for IANA to consider the Reserved
        ports for assignment. This is part of the motivation for not
        automatically assigning ports for transport protocols other than the
        requested one(s). This will allow more ports to be available for
        assignment at that point. To help conserve ports, application
        developers SHOULD request assignment of only those transport protocols that their
        application currently uses.</t>

        <t>Conservation of port numbers is improved by procedures that allow
        previously assigned port numbers to become Unassigned, either through
        de-assignment or through revocation, and by a procedure that lets
        application designers transfer an assigned but unused port number to
        a new application. <xref target="iana-procedures"></xref> describes
        these procedures, which until now were undocumented. Port number
        conservation is also improved by recommending that applications that
        do not require an assigned port should register only a service name
        without an associated port number.</t>

            other assignment process issue. This is OPTIONAL. This list may be updated by IANA

            de-assignment, owner/name changes, etc.</t>
          </list></t>

<t>
  If the assignment request is for the addition of a new transport
  protocol to a previously assigned service name and the requester is not
  the Assignee or Contact for the previously assigned service name, IANA
  needs to confirm with the Assignee for the existing assignment
  whether this addition is appropriate.
</t>
<t>
  If the assignment request is for a new service name sharing the same
  port as a previously assigned service name (see port number overloading
  in <xref target="srvname"/>), IANA needs to confirm with the Assignee for the
  existing service name and other appropriate experts whether the
  overloading is appropriate.
</t>

        <t>When IANA receives an assignment request -- containing the 
        above information -- that is requesting a port number, IANA SHALL 
        initiate an "Expert Review" <xref target="RFC5226"></xref> in 
        order to determine whether an assignment should be made. For 
        requests that are not seeking a port number, IANA SHOULD 
        assign the service name under a simple "First Come First Served" 
        policy <xref target="RFC5226"></xref>.</t>

        <section anchor="variances"
               title="Variances for Specific Port Number Ranges">
            <t><xref target="types"></xref> describes the different port number
            ranges. It is important to note that IANA applies slightly different
            procedures when managing the different port ranges of the service name
            and port number registry: <list style="symbols">
                <t>Ports in the Dynamic Ports range (49152-65535) have been
                specifically set aside for local and dynamic use and cannot be
                assigned through IANA. Application software may simply use
                any dynamic port that is available on the local host,
                without any sort of assignment. On the other
                hand, application software MUST NOT assume that a specific port
                number in the Dynamic Ports range will always be available for
                communication at all times, and a port number in that range hence
                MUST NOT be used as a service identifier.</t>
     
                <t>Ports in the User Ports range (1024-49151) are available for
                assignment through IANA, and MAY be used as service identifiers
                upon successful assignment. Because assigning a port number
                for a specific application consumes a fraction of the shared
                resource that is the port number registry, IANA will require the
                requester to document the intended use of the port number. For  
				most IETF protocols, ports in the User Ports range will be 
				assigned under the "IETF Review" or "IESG Approval" procedures 
				<xref target="RFC5226"></xref> and no further documentation 
				is required. Where these procedures do not apply, then the 
				requester must input the documentation to the "Expert Review" 
                procedure <xref target="RFC5226"></xref>, by which IANA will have
                a technical expert review the request to determine whether to
                grant the assignment. Regardless of the path ("IETF Review",
				"IESG Approval", or "Expert Review"), the submitted documentation
				is expected to be the same, as described in this section, 
				and MUST explain
                why using a port number in the Dynamic Ports range is unsuitable
                for the given application. Further, IANA MAY utilize the
				"Expert Review" process informally to inform their position 
				in participating in "IETF Review" and "IESG Approval".</t>

     
                <t>Ports in the System Ports range (0-1023) are also available for
                assignment through IANA. Because the System Ports range is both
                the smallest and the most densely assigned, the requirements for
                new assignments are more strict than those for the User Ports
                range, and will only be granted under the "IETF Review" or "IESG
                Approval" procedures <xref target="RFC5226"></xref>. A
                request for a System Port number MUST document *both* why using a
                port number from the Dynamic Ports range is unsuitable *and* why using a
                port number from the User Ports range is unsuitable for that application.</t>

      <section anchor="deassignment"
               title="Service Name and Port Number De-Assignment">
        <t>The Assignee of a granted port number assignment can
        return the port number to IANA at any time if they no longer have a
        need for it. The port number will be de-assigned and will be marked
        as Reserved. IANA should not reassign port numbers that have been
        de-assigned until all unassigned port numbers in the specific range
        have been assigned.</t>

        <t>Before proceeding with a port number de-assignment, IANA needs to
        reasonably establish that the value is actually no longer in use.</t>

        <t>Because there is much less danger of exhausting the service name
        space compared to the port number space, it is RECOMMENDED that a
        given service name remain assigned even after all associated port
        number assignments have become de-assigned. Under this policy, it
        will appear in the registry as if it had been created through a
        service name assignment request that did not include any port
        numbers.</t>

        <t>On rare occasions, it may still be useful to de-assign a service
        name. In such cases, IANA will mark the service name as Reserved. IANA
        will involve their IESG-appointed expert in such cases.</t>
        
        <t>IANA will include a comment in the registry when de-assignment
        happens to indicate its historic usage.</t>

      <section anchor="reuse" title="Service Name and Port Number Reuse">
        <t>If the Assignee of a granted port number assignment
        no longer has a need for the assigned number, but would like to
        reuse it for a different application, they can submit a request to
        IANA to do so.</t>

        <t>Logically, port number reuse is to be thought of as a
        de-assignment (<xref target="deassignment"></xref>) followed by an
        immediate (re-)assignment (<xref target="assignment"></xref>) of the
        same port number for a new application. Consequently, the information
        that needs to be provided about the proposed new use of the port
        number is identical to what would need to be provided for a new port
        number assignment for the specific ports range.</t>

        <t>Because there is much less danger of exhausting the service name
        space compared to the port number space, it is RECOMMENDED that the
        original service name associated with the prior use of the port number
        remains assigned, and a new service name be created and associated with the
        port number. This is again consistent with viewing a reuse request as
        a de-assignment followed by an immediate (re-)assignment. Reusing
        an assigned service name for a different application is NOT
        RECOMMENDED.</t>

        <t>IANA needs to carefully review such requests before approving them.
        In some instances, the Expert Reviewer will determine that the
        application the port number was assigned to has found usage
        beyond the original Assignee, or that there is a concern that it may
        have such users. This determination MUST be made quickly. A community
        call concerning revocation of a port number (see below) MAY be
        considered, if a broader use of the port number is suspected.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="revocation"
               title="Service Name and Port Number Revocation">
        <t>A port number revocation can be thought of as an IANA-initiated
        de-assignment (<xref target="deassignment"></xref>), and has
        exactly the same effect on the registry.</t>

        <t>Sometimes, it will be clear that a specific port number is no
        longer in use and that IANA can revoke it and mark it as Reserved. At
        other times, it may be unclear whether a given assigned port number is
        still in use somewhere in the Internet. In those cases, IANA must
        carefully consider the consequences of revoking the port number, and
        SHOULD only do so if there is an overwhelming need.</t>

        <t>With the help of their IESG-appointed Expert Reviewer, IANA SHALL
        formulate a request to the IESG to issue a four-week community call
        concerning the pending port number revocation. The IESG and IANA, with
        the Expert Reviewer's support, SHALL determine promptly after the end
        of the community call whether revocation should proceed, and then
        communicate their decision to the community. This procedure typically
        involves similar steps to de-assignment except that it is initiated
        by IANA.</t>

        <t>Because there is much less danger of exhausting the service name
        space compared to the port number space, revoking service names is NOT

        assignments to be transferred between parties, even when they are

      of a service name or port number does not in any way imply an

      <t>This document obsoletes Sections 8 and 9.1 of the March 2000 IANA
      Allocation Guidelines <xref target="RFC2780"></xref>.</t>

      <!-- This is trivia that belongs in an email message, not in a
      public document that exists in perpetuity. A year from now what
      people will care about is how to register their service, not a
      tedious exhaustive history of how it came to be that way.
      
      Lars says: No, it needs to be here, because all IANA actions need
      to be described in the document.
      -->

      <t>Upon approval of this document for publication as an RFC, IANA worked with Stuart
      Cheshire, maintainer of the independent service name registry <xref
      target="SRVREG"></xref>, to merge the contents of that private
      registry into the official IANA registry. The
      independent registry web page has been updated with pointers to the IANA
      registry and to this RFC.</t>

      <t>IANA created a new service name entry in the service
      name and port number registry <xref target="PORTREG"></xref> for all
      entries in the Protocol and Service Names registry <xref
      target="PROTSERVREG"></xref> that did not already have one
      assigned.</t>

      <t>IANA also indicates in the Assignment Notes for "www"
      and "www-http" that they are duplicate terms that refer to the "http" service,
      and should not be used for
      discovery purposes. For this conceptual service (human-readable web
      pages served over HTTP), the correct service name to use for
      service discovery purposes is "http" (see <xref
      target="srvname"></xref>).</t>

      <section anchor="consistency" title="Service Name Consistency">
        <t><xref target="assignment"></xref> defines which character strings
        are well-formed service names, which until now had not been clearly
        defined. The definition in <xref target="assignment"></xref> was
        chosen to allow maximum compatibility of service names with current
        and future service discovery mechanisms.</t>

        <t>As of August 5, 2009, approximately 98% of the so-called "Short
        Names" from existing port number assignments <xref
        target="PORTREG"></xref> met the rules for legal service names stated
        in <xref target="assignment"></xref>, and hence for these services
        their service name is exactly the same as their "Short Name".</t>

        <t>The remaining approximately 2% of the existing "Short Names" are not
        suitable to be used directly as well-formed service names because they
        contain illegal characters such as asterisks, dots, pluses, slashes,
        or underscores. All existing "Short Names" conform to the length
        requirement of 15 characters or fewer. For these 96 unsuitable "Short
        Names", listed in the table below, the service name is the Short
        Name with any illegal characters replaced by hyphens. IANA added
        an entry to the registry that uses the new well-formed primary service
        name for the existing service and that otherwise duplicates the original
        assignment information. In the description field of this new entry
        giving the primary service name, IANA recorded that it has assigned a
        well-formed service name for the previous service and references the
        original assignment. In the Assignment Notes field of the original
        assignment, IANA added a note that this entry is an alias to the
        new well-formed service name, and that the old service name is
        historic, not usable for use with many common service discovery
        mechanisms.</t>

  There were four names recorded in IANA's Port Number Registry
  [PORTREG] that conflicted with names previously recorded in the ad
  hoc SRV name registry [SRVREG]: esp, hydra, recipe, and xmp.
</t>
<t>

  The name conflicts were resolved amicably:
</t>
<t>
  The IANA Port Number Registry Short Name "esp" had been registered
  by Andrew Chernow, and he informed the authors that the port was no
  longer in use and the registration was no longer required. The SRV
  registry entry for "esp" remains in effect.
</t>
<t>
  The SRV name "hydra" for SubEthaEdit had already been retired in
  favor of the new SRV name "see". The IANA Port Number Registry
  entry for "hydra" remains in effect.
</t>
<t>
  The SRV name "recipe" was in use in an open source project that had
  not yet been packaged for distribution, and the registrant Daniel
  Taylor was willing to change to a different service name. Thanks to
  Daniel Taylor for accommodating this change. The IANA Port Number
  Registry entry for "recipe" remains in effect.
</t>
<t>
  The IANA Port Number Registry Short Name "xmp" had been registered
  by Bobby Krupczak, but since his registration included an assigned

  to Bobby Krupczak for accommodating this change. The SRV
  registry entry for "xmp" remains in effect.

               title="Port Numbers for SCTP and DCCP Experimentation">
        <t>Two System UDP and TCP ports, 1021 and 1022, have been reserved for
        experimental use <xref target="RFC4727"></xref>. This document assigns
        the same port numbers for SCTP and DCCP, updates the TCP and UDP
        assignments, and also instructs IANA to automatically assign these
        two port numbers for any future transport protocol with a similar
        16-bit port number namespace.</t>

        <t>Note that these port numbers are meant for temporary
        experimentation and development in controlled environments. Before
        using these port numbers, carefully consider the advice in <xref
        target="udptcpexp"></xref> in this document, as well as in Sections 1
        and 1.1 of "Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers Considered
        Useful" <xref target="RFC3692"></xref>. Most importantly, application
        developers must request a permanent port number assignment from IANA
        as described in <xref target="assignment"></xref> before any kind of
        non-experimental deployment.</t>

      <section anchor="dccp" title="Updates to DCCP Registries">
        <t>This document updates the IANA assignment procedures for the DCCP
        Port Number and DCCP Service Codes Registries <xref
        target="RFC4340"></xref>.</t>

        <section title="DCCP Service Code Registry">
          <t>Service codes are assigned on a "first come, first
          served" basis according to
          Section 19.8 of the DCCP specification <xref
          target="RFC4340"></xref>. This document updates that section by
          extending the guidelines given there in the following ways:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>IANA MAY assign new service codes without seeking "Expert
              Review" using their discretion, but SHOULD seek "Expert Review" if
              a request asks for more than five service codes.</t>

              <t>IANA should feel free to contact the DCCP Expert Reviewer
              with any questions related to requests for DCCP-related codepoints.</t>
            </list></t>
        </section>

        <section title="DCCP Port Numbers Registry">
          <t>The DCCP ports registry is defined by Section 19.9 of the DCCP
          specification <xref target="RFC4340"></xref>. Assignments in this
          registry require prior assignment of a service code. Not all service
          codes require IANA-assigned ports. This document updates that
          section by extending the guidelines given there in the following
          way:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>IANA should normally assign a value in the range 1024-49151
              to a DCCP server port. IANA requests to assign port
              numbers in the System Ports range (0 through 1023) require an
              "IETF Review" <xref target="RFC5226"></xref> prior to assignment
              by IANA <xref target="RFC4340"></xref>.</t>

              <t>IANA MUST NOT assign more than one DCCP server port to a
              single service code value.</t>

              <t>The assignment of multiple service codes to the same DCCP
              port is allowed, but subject to "Expert Review".</t>

              <t>The set of service code values associated with a DCCP server
              port should be recorded in the service name and port number
              registry.</t>

              <t>A request for additional service codes to be associated with
              an already assigned port number requires "Expert Review". These
              requests will normally be accepted when they originate from the
              contact associated with the port assignment. In other cases,
              these applications will be expected to use an unassigned port,
              when this is available.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The DCCP specification <xref target="RFC4340"></xref> notes that
          a short port name MUST be associated with each DCCP server port that
          has been assigned. This document clarifies that this short port name
          is the service name as defined here, and this name MUST be
          unique.</t>

<abstract><t>This document describes a protocol for automating the process of creating Network Address Translation (NAT) port mappings. Included in the protocol is a method for retrieving the external IP address of a NAT gateway, thus allowing a client to make this external IP address and port number known to peers that may wish to communicate with it. This protocol is implemented in current Apple products including Mac OS X, Bonjour for Windows, and AirPort wireless base stations.</t></abstract>
