      <t>
        In the past, Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems have
        used very rigid policies that were implemented in particular
        protocols and platforms.  As MAC systems become more widely
        deployed, additional flexibility in mechanism and policy
        will be required.  While traditional trusted systems
        implemented Multi-Level Security (MLS) and integrity models,
        modern systems have expanded to include such technologies
        as type enforcement.  Due to the wide range of policies and
        mechanisms that need to be accommodated, it is unlikely
        that the use of a single security label format and model will
        be viable.
      </t>

      <t>
        To allow multiple MAC mechanisms and label formats to
        co-exist in a network, this document creates a registry
        of label format specifications.  This registry contains
        label format identifiers and provides for the association
        of each such identifier with a corresponding extensive
        document outlining the exact syntax and use of the
        particular label format.

<section anchor="sec:intro" title="Introduction">
  <t>
    With the acceptance of security labels in several mainstream
    operating systems, the need to communicate labels between these
    systems becomes more important. In a typical client-and-server
    scenario, the client request to the server acts as a subject
    trying to access an object on the server <xref target='RFC7204' />.
    Unfortunately, these systems are diverse enough that attempts
    at establishing one common label format have been unsuccessful.
    This is because systems implement different Mandatory Access Control
    (MAC) models, which typically do not share any common ground.
  </t>

  <t>
    One solution might be to define a single label format that
    consists of the union of the requirements of all MAC
    models/implementations, known at a given time. This approach is
    not desirable, because it introduces an environment where either
    (1) many MAC models would have blank fields for many of the
    label's components or (2) many implementations would ignore
    altogether many of the values that are present. The resulting
    complexity would be likely to result in a confusing situation
    in which the interaction of fields that are derived from different
    MAC models is never clearly specified and the addition of new
    models or extensions of existing models is unduly difficult.
  </t>

  <t>
    An additional consideration is that if a policy authority or
    identifier field is specified in the label format, it would
    require a robust description that would encompass multiple MAC
    models where an implementation would lock policy administration
    into the described model.
  </t>

  <t>
    Ideally, a mechanism to address this problem should allow the
    most flexibility possible in terms of policy administration
    while providing a specification that is sufficient to allow for
    implementation of the label format and understanding of the
    semantics of the label.  This means that the label format
    specification  would ideally contain a syntactic description
    of the label format and a description of the semantics for each
    component in the label.  This allows protocols to specify the
    type of label and label semantics that it requires while leaving
    policy and policy administration to the individual organizations
    using the protocol in their environment.
  </t>

  <t>
    Policy administration within an organization is a difficult
    problem.  This should not be made even more difficult by having
    to request permission from external entities when crafting new
    policy or just making department specific modifications to
    existing policies.  The policy authority field would allow
    a label format specification to specify a scheme for policy
    administration without forcing it on all users of security
    labels.  However, by agreeing to implement a particular label
    format specification, the protocol agrees to that policy
    administration mechanism when processing labels of that type.
  </t>

  <t>
    This document creates a registry of label format specifications
    to allow multiple MAC mechanisms and label formats to co-exist
    in a network. While the initial use of this registry is for the
    Network File System (NFS) protocol, it might also be referenced
    and used by other IETF protocols in the future.

    <t>
      The "IP Security Option (IPSO)" label format is
      defined in <xref target='RFC1108' />.  IANA has assigned
      IPv4 Option 130 to the IPSO Basic Security Option (BSO).
      IPSO is the only IPv4 sensitivity label option implemented
      in commercial IP routers.  IPSO BSO continues to have
      widespread implementation in hosts, and widespread
      deployment.  For the purposes of this document, only the
      BSO labels in Table 1 on Page 3 of <xref target='RFC1108' />
      are used.
    </t>

    <t>
      In some locales, the BSO value "(Reserved 2)" is used for
      marking information that is considered "Restricted" by local
      policy, where "Restricted" is less sensitive than "Confidential"
      but more sensitive than "Unclassified".

      The "Commercial IP Security Option (CIPSO)" label format is
      documented in <xref target='CIPSO' /> and in <xref target='FIPS-188' />.
      While <xref target='CIPSO' /> is
      long expired, it is widely supported in deployed MLS systems that
      support IPv4.  IANA has assigned IPv4 option number 134 to CIPSO.
      CIPSO is defined ONLY as an IPv4 option.  IANA has never assigned
      any IPv6 option value to CIPSO.

      is defined for IPv6.  As noted in Section 10 of
      <xref target='RFC5570' />, CALIPSO is a direct derivative of
      the IPv4 "Son of IPSO" (SIPSO); therefore, CALIPSO is NOT
      derived from CIPSO in any way.

    This document defines a mechanism to associate the Label Format Specifier
    identifier with a document outlining the syntax and format of

<section anchor="sec:iana" title="IANA Considerations">
  <t>
    This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
    Authority (IANA) regarding the creation of a new registry in
    accordance with <xref target='RFC5226' />.
  </t>

  <t>
    Per this document, IANA has created a new registry called 
    "Security Label Format Selection Registry".  The new registry
    has the following fields:

    <list style='hanging'>
      <t hangText='Label Format Specifier:'>
        An integer that maps to a particular label format,
        e.g., the CALIPSO label format defined by
        <xref target='RFC5570' />.  The namespace of this
        identifier has the range of 0..65535.
      </t>

      <t hangText='Label Description:'>
        A human-readable ASCII <xref target='RFC20' /> text string
        that describes the label format, e.g.,
        "Common Architecture Label IPv6 Security Option (CALIPSO)".
        The length of this field is limited to 128 bytes.
      </t>

      <t hangText='Status:'>
        A short ASCII text string indicating the status of an entry
        in the registry.  The status field for most entries should
        have the value "active".  In the case where a label format
        selection entry is obsolete, the status field of the obsoleted
        entry should be "obsoleted by entry NNN".
      </t>

      <t hangText='Label Format Specification:'>
        A reference to a stable, public document that specifies the

  <section anchor="sec:iana:new" title="Adding a New Entry to the Registry">
    <t>
      A label format specification document is required to add a new
      entry to the "Security Label Format Selection Registry".
      If the label format document is inside the RFC path, then the
      IANA Considerations section of the label format document should
      clearly reference the "Security Label Format Selection Registry"
      and request allocation of a new entry.  The well-known IANA policy
      Specification Required, as defined in
      Section 4.1 of <xref target='RFC5226' />, will be used to handle
      such requests.  Note that the "Specification Required" policy implies
      that this process requires a Designated Expert, i.e., adding
      a new entry to this registry requires both a published label
      format specification and a Designated Expert review.
    </t>

    <t>
      In reviewing the published label format specification, the
      Designated Expert should consider whether or not the specification
      provides sufficient semantics for the object and subject labels to
      enforce the MAC model and policy administration when deployed within
      an organization. Another consideration is if the label format allows
      a correct and complete implementation of the protocol to process
      and enforce labels as a policy administration mechanism. Finally,
      to reduce interoperability issues, the reviewer must determine if
      the new label format specification has clearly defined syntax and
      semantics for the proposed new labels.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="sec:iana:obs" title="Obsoleting a Label Format Specifier">
    <t>
      In the case where a label format selector number is assigned to
      a label format and the label format specification is changed
      later, a new selector assignment should be requested.  The same
      Specification Required IANA policy applies to such requests.
      The IANA Considerations section of the updated label format
      specification should be explicit regarding which old label selector
      assignment it obsoletes.  Below is an example of an obsoleted entry
