    <abstract>
      <t>This memo updates the IANA IPv4 and IPv6 Special-Purpose Address
      Registries to address issues 
      raised by the definition of a "global" prefix. It also corrects several errors in registry
      entries to ensure the integrity of the IANA Special-Purpose Address Registries.</t>

      <t>This memo updates RFC 6890.</t>
    </abstract>

<section title="Introduction">
<t>In order to support new protocols and practices, the IETF
occasionally reserves an address block for a special purpose.  For
example, <xref target="RFC1122" /> reserves an IPv4 address block (0.0.0.0/8) to
represent the local (i.e., "this") network. Likewise, <xref target="RFC4291" />
reserves an IPv6 address block (fe80::/10) for link-local unicast addresses.</t>

<t>Several issues have been raised with the documentation of some of the special-purpose
address blocks in <xref target="RFC6890" />. Specifically, the definition of
"global" provided in <xref target="RFC6890" /> was misleading as it slightly differed from
the generally accepted definition of "global scope" (i.e., the ability to forward beyond
the boundaries of an administrative domain, described as
"global unicast" in the IPv6 addressing architecture <xref target="RFC4291" />).</t>

<t>This memo updates the definition of "global" from <xref target="RFC6890" />
for the IPv4 and IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registries, augments the fields contained
within the registries in order to address the confusion raised by the
definition of "global", and corrects some errors in some of the entries in the Special-Purpose
Address Registries.</t>

<t>This memo updates <xref target="RFC6890" />.</t>

<section title="IANA Considerations">

<section title="Definition of Globally Reachable">

<t><xref target="RFC6890" /> defined the term "global" without taking into
consideration the multiple uses of the term. Specifically, IP addresses can be
global in terms of allocation scope as well as global in terms of
routing/reachability. To address this ambiguity, the use of the term "global"
defined in <xref target="RFC6890" /> is replaced with "globally
reachable". The following definition replaces the definition of "global" in
the IANA Special-Purpose Address Registries: 

<list style="symbols">
  <t>Globally Reachable - A boolean value indicating whether an IP datagram whose
     destination address is drawn from the allocated special-purpose
     address block is forwardable beyond a specified administrative
     domain.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The same relationship between the value of "Destination" and the values of "Forwardable" and
"Global" described in <xref target="RFC6890" /> holds for "Globally Reachable". If the value of
"Destination" is FALSE, the values of "Forwardable" and "Globally Reachable" must also be FALSE.</t>

<t>The "Global" columns in the IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry
(https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry) and the
IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry)
have been renamed to "Globally Reachable".</t>

</section>

<section title="Updates to the IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry">

<t><list style="symbols">
   <t>Limited Broadcast prefix (255.255.255.255/32) - The Reserved-by-Protocol
   value has changed from False to True. This change was made to align the
   registry with reservation of the limited broadcast 
      address with Section 7 of <xref target="RFC0919" />.</t>
</list></t>

</section>

<section title="Updates to the IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry">

<t>The following changes to the "IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry" involved
the insertion of two new footnotes. These additions required that 
   the footnotes be renumbered</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
   <t>TEREDO prefix (2001::/32) - The Globally Reachable value has changed from
   False to "N/A [2]". The [2] footnote now states:
      <list style="symbols">
         <t>See Section 5 of <xref target="RFC4380" /> for details.</t>
      </list></t>
   <t>EID Space for LISP (2001:5::/32) - All footnotes have been incremented by 1.</t>
   <t>6to4 (2002::/16) - All footnotes have been incremented by 1.</t>
   <t>Unique-Local (fc00::/7) - The Globally Reachable value has changed from
   False to "False [7]". The [7] footnote now states:
      <list style="symbols">
         <t>See <xref target="RFC4193" /> for more details on the routability
	 of Unique-Local addresses. The Unique-Local prefix is drawn from the
	 IPv6 Global Unicast Address range but is specified 
         as not globally routed.</t>
      </list></t>
</list></t>
