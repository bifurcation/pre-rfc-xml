            This paper documents the needs in various
            industries to establish multi-hop paths 
            for characterized flows with deterministic properties.

        <section anchor='introduction' title="Introduction">
   
   <t>"Deterministic Networking Use Cases" <xref target="RFC8578"/>
      illustrates that beyond the classical case
      of Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACSs) there are in fact
      multiple industries with strong, and relatively similar, needs for
      deterministic network services with latency guarantees and ultra&nbhy;low
      packet loss. 
   </t><t>
   The generalization of the needs for more deterministic networks has led
   to the IEEE 802.1 Audio Video Bridging (AVB) Task Group becoming the
   <xref target="IEEE-802.1TSNTG">Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)</xref>
   Task Group (TG), with a much&nbhy;expanded constituency from the
   industrial and vehicular markets. 
   </t><t>
      Along with this expansion, the networks considered here are becoming 
      larger and structured, requiring deterministic forwarding beyond the LAN
      boundaries. For instance, an IACS segregates the network along the broad 
      lines of the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA) 
      <xref target="ISA95"/>, typically using deterministic LANs
      for Purdue level&nbsp;2 control systems, whereas public infrastructures such as
      electricity automation require deterministic properties over the wide
      area.  Implementers have come to realize that the convergence of IT and Operation
      Technology (OT) networks requires Layer&nbsp;3, as well as Layer&nbsp;2, capabilities.
          </t><t>
                While the initial user base has focused almost entirely on Ethernet physical
                media and Ethernet-based bridging protocols from several Standards Development
                Organizations (SDOs), the need for Layer&nbsp;3, as expressed above, must not be confined
                to Ethernet and Ethernet-like media. While such media must be encompassed
                by any useful Deterministic Networking (DetNet) architecture,
        cooperation between the IETF and other
                SDOs must not be limited to the IEEE or the IEEE&nbsp;802 organizations.
 Furthermore, while both completed and ongoing work in other SDOs, and in IEEE 802 in particular, provides
                an obvious starting point for a DetNet architecture, we must not assume that
                these other SDOs' work confines the space in which the DetNet architecture
                progresses.
   </t><t> 

      The properties of deterministic networks will have specific requirements
      for the use of routed networks to support these applications, and a new
      model must be proposed to integrate this determinism in IT
      implementations. The proposed model should enable a fully scheduled
      operation orchestrated by a central controller and may support a more
      distributed operation with (probably lesser) capabilities. At any rate,
      the model should not compromise the ability of a network to keep
      carrying the sorts of traffic that is already carried today in
      conjunction with new, more deterministic flows. 
      Note: "Deterministic Networking
      Architecture" <xref target='DetNet-Arch'/> was produced by the DetNet Working Group to describe that model.
</t><t>
      At the time of this writing, it is expected that</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
      <t>once the abstract model is agreed upon, the IETF will specify
      (1)&nbsp;the signaling elements to be used to establish a path and
      (2)&nbsp;the tagging elements to be used to identify the flows that are
      to be forwarded along that path</t>
      <t>the IETF will specify the necessary protocols or protocol additions,
      based on relevant IETF technologies, to implement the selected model</t>
    </list></t>

      <t>A desirable outcome of the work is the ability to establish a
      multi&nbhy;hop path over the IP or MPLS network for a particular flow
      with given timing and precise throughput requirements and to carry this
      particular flow along the multi&nbhy;hop path with such characteristics
      as low latency and ultra&nbhy;low jitter, reordering and/or replication
      and elimination of packets over non&nbhy;congruent paths for a higher
      delivery ratio, and/or zero congestion loss, regardless of the amount of
      other flows in the network.</t>
      <t>
      Depending on the network capabilities and the current state, requests to
      establish a path by an end node or a network management entity may be
      granted or rejected, an existing path may be moved or removed, and DetNet
      flows exceeding their contract may face packet declassification and drop.</t>

    <section title="On Deterministic Networking">

<t>    
The Internet is not the only digital network that has grown dramatically over 
the last 30-40 years.  Video and audio entertainment, as well as control
systems for machinery, manufacturing processes, and vehicles, are also
ubiquitous and are now based almost entirely on digital technologies.  Over
the past 10&nbsp;years, engineers in these fields have come to realize that
significant advantages in both cost and the ability to accelerate growth can
be obtained by basing all of these disparate digital technologies on packet
networks.</t>
<t>The goals of Deterministic Networking are to (1)&nbsp;enable the migration
 of applications with critical timing and reliability issues that
 currently use special-purpose fieldbus technologies (High-Definition
 Multimedia Interface (HDMI), Controller Area Network (CAN bus),
 PROFIBUS <xref target="PROFIBUS"/>, etc. ... even RS-232!) to packet
 technologies in general and to IP in particular and (2)&nbsp;support both
 these new applications and existing packet network applications over the same
 physical network. In other words, a deterministic network is backwards
 compatible with (capable of transporting) statistically multiplexed traffic
 while preserving the properties of the accepted deterministic flows.
</t>

<t><xref target='RFC8578'/> indicates that applications in multiple fields need some or all of a suite of features that includes:
 <list style="numbers">
 <t>Time synchronization of all host and network nodes (routers and&wj;/or
 bridges), accurate to something between 10&nbsp;nanoseconds and
 10&nbsp;microseconds, depending on the application.</t>

 <t>Support for deterministic packet flows that:
   <list style="symbols">
   <t>Can be unicast or multicast.</t>
   <t>Need absolute guarantees of minimum and maximum latency end&nbsp;to&nbsp;end across
      the network; sometimes a tight jitter is required as well.</t>
   <t>Need a packet loss ratio beyond the classical range for a particular
      medium, in the range of 10^-9 to 10^-12 or better on Ethernet and on the
      order of 10^-5 in wireless sensor mesh networks.</t>
   <t>Can, in total, absorb more than half of the network's available
      bandwidth (that is, massive over-provisioning is ruled out as a
      solution).</t>
   <t>Cannot suffer throttling, congestion feedback, or any other
      network-imposed transmission delay, although the flows can be
      meaningfully characterized by either (1)&nbsp;a fixed, repeating
      transmission schedule or (2)&nbsp;a maximum bandwidth and packet
      size.</t>
 </list></t>

     <t>Multiple methods for scheduling, shaping, limiting, and otherwise
     controlling the transmission of critical packets at each hop through the
     network data plane.</t>
     <t>Robust defenses against misbehaving hosts, routers, or bridges, in both the 
     data plane and the control plane, with guarantees that a critical flow within its 
     guaranteed resources cannot be affected by other flows, whatever the
     pressures on the network.  For more on the specific threats against
     DetNet, see "Deterministic Networking
     (DetNet) Security Considerations" <xref target='DetNet-Security'/>.</t>
     <t>One or more methods for reserving resources in bridges and routers to
     carry these flows.</t>
 </list></t>

<t> 
Time-synchronization techniques need not be addressed by an IETF working
group; there are a number of standards available for this purpose, including
IEEE 1588 <xref target="IEEE-1588"/>,
IEEE 802.1AS <xref target="IEEE-8021AS"/>, and more.
</t>
 <t>The needs related to multicast, latency, loss ratio,
  and throttling avoidance exist because the algorithms employed
  by the applications demand it.
They are not simply the transliteration of fieldbus needs to a packet-based 
fieldbus simulation; they also reflect fundamental mathematics of the
control of a physical system.</t>
 <t>With classical forwarding of latency-sensitive and loss-sensitive packets
 across a network, interactions among different critical flows introduce
 fundamental uncertainties in delivery schedules.  The details of the queuing, shaping,
 and scheduling algorithms employed by each bridge or router to control the
 output sequence on a given port affect the detailed makeup of the output
 stream, e.g., how finely a given flow's packets are mixed among those of other
 flows.</t>
 <t>This, in turn, has a strong effect on the buffer requirements, and hence the 
latency guarantees deliverable, by the next bridge or router along the path.  
For this reason, the IEEE 802.1 TSN TG has defined
a new set of queuing, shaping, and scheduling algorithms that enable each bridge
or router to compute the exact number of buffers to be allocated for each flow
or class of flows.  
 </t>
 <t>Networking protocols commonly need robustness.  Note that robustness plays
a particularly important part in real&nbhy;time control networks, where
expensive equipment, and even lives, can be lost due to misbehaving
equipment.</t>

 <t>Reserving resources before packet transmission is the one fundamental shift in 
the behavior of network applications that is impossible to avoid.  
In the first place, a network cannot deliver finite latency and practically zero 
packet loss to an arbitrarily high offered load.  Secondly, achieving 
practically zero packet loss for unthrottled (though bandwidth-limited) flows 
means that bridges and routers have to dedicate buffer resources to specific 
flows or classes of flows.  The requirements of each reservation have to be 
translated into the parameters that control each host's, bridge's, and router's 
queuing, shaping, and scheduling functions and delivered to the hosts, bridges, 
and routers.</t>

    <section anchor="ps" title="Problem Statement">
        <section anchor="arch" title="Supported Topologies">
   <t>In some use cases, the end point that runs the application is involved
   in the Deterministic Networking operation -- for instance, by controlling certain
   aspects of its throughput, such as rate or precise time of emission. In
   such a case, the deterministic path is end&nbsp;to&nbsp;end from
   application host to application host.
   </t>
   <t>On the other end, the deterministic portion of a path may be a tunnel between
   an ingress point and an egress router. In any case, routers and switches in between
   should not need to be aware of whether the path is end&nbsp;to&nbsp;end or a tunnel.</t>
   <t>While it is clear that DetNet does not aim to set up deterministic 
   paths over the global Internet, there is still a lack of clarity regarding
   the limits of a domain where a deterministic path can be set up. These
   limits may depend on the technology that is used to set the path up,
   whether it is centralized or distributed.
   </t>
   </section>

    <section anchor="flow" title="Flow Characterization">
    <t>
    Deterministic forwarding can only apply to flows with such well&nbhy;defined
    characteristics as periodicity and burstiness. Before a path can be
    established to serve them, the expression of those characteristics, and how
    the network can serve them (for instance, in shaping and forwarding 
    operations), must be specified.
    </t>
    </section>

  <section anchor="pcep" title="Centralized Path Computation and Installation">
    <t>A centralized routing model, such as that provided with a Path
    Computation Element (PCE) (see <xref target="RFC4655"/>), enables global
    and per&nbhy;flow optimizations. This type of model is attractive, but a
    number of issues remain to be solved -- in particular:</t>

    <t><list style="symbols">
    <t>whether and how the path computation can be installed by
      <list style="symbols">
      <t>an end device or</t>
      <t>a network management entity</t>
      </list>
    </t></list></t>

    <t><list>
      <t>and</t>
    </list></t>

    <t><list style="symbols">
    <t>how the path is set up -- either
      <list style="symbols">
      <t>by installing state at each hop with a direct interaction between
      the forwarding device and the PCE or</t>
      <t>along a path by injecting a source-routed request at one end of
      the path, following classical Traffic Engineering (TE) models</t>
      </list>
    </t></list></t>

    <t>To enable a centralized model, DetNet should produce a description
      of the high&nbhy;level interaction and data models to:
      <list style="symbols">
      <t>report the topology and device capabilities to the central
         controller</t>
      <t>establish a direct interface between the centralized PCE and each 
         device under its control in order to enable vertical signaling</t>
      <t>request a path setup for a new flow with particular characteristics
         over the service interface and control it through its life cycle</t>
      <t>provide support for life-cycle management for a path
         (instantiate/modify/update/delete)</t>
      <t>provide support for adaptability to cope with such various events
         as loss of a link</t>
      <t>expose the status of the path to the end devices (User-Network
         Interfaces (UNIs))</t>
      <t>provide additional reliability through redundancy, particularly
    with Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering Functions
    (PREOF), where redundant paths may deliver packets out of order
    and PREOF may need to correct the ordering</t>
      <t>indicate the flows and packet sequences in-band with the flows.
    This is needed for flows that require PREOF in order to isolate
    duplicates and reorder packets at the end of the sequence</t>
    </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="dc" title="Distributed Path Setup">
    <t>Whether a distributed alternative without a PCE can be valuable could
    be studied as well. Such an alternative could, for instance, build upon
    Resource Reservation Protocol - TE (RSVP-TE) flows <xref
    target="RFC3209"/>. But the focus of the work should be to deliver the
    centralized approach first.
    </t><t>
    To enable functionality similar to that of RSVP-TE, the following steps
    would take place:
    <list style="numbers">
    <t>
    Neighbors and their capabilities would be discovered and exposed to
    compute a path that would fit the DetNet constraints -- typically those
    of latency, time precision, and resource availability.
    </t><t>
    A constrained path would be calculated with an improved version of
    Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) that is aware of DetNet.
    </t><t>
    The path may be installed using a control protocol such as RSVP&nbhy;TE,
    extended to enable flow identification and install new per&nbhy;hop
    behavior such as Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering, and to
    reserve physical resources for the flow.  In that case, traffic flows
    could be transported through an MPLS-TE tunnel, using the reserved
    resources for this flow at each hop.
    </t>
</list>
    </t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="DupFormat" title="Duplicated Data Format">
          <t>
          In some cases, the duplication and elimination of packets over
          non&nbhy;congruent paths are required to achieve a sufficiently
          high delivery ratio to meet application needs.  In these cases, a
          small number of packet formats and supporting protocols are
          required (preferably just one of each) to serialize the packets of
          a DetNet stream at one point in the network,
          replicate them at one or more points in the network, and
          discard duplicates at one or more other points in the network,
          including perhaps the destination host.  Using an existing
          solution would be preferable to inventing a new one.

    <section title="Security Considerations">

        <t>
                Security in the context of Deterministic Networking has an added
                dimension; the time of delivery of a packet can be just as important
                as the contents of the packet itself.  A man-in-the-middle attack,
                for example, can impose and then systematically adjust additional
                delays into a link, and thus disrupt or subvert a real&nbhy;time
                application without having to crack any encryption methods employed.
                See <xref target="RFC7384"/> for an
                exploration of this issue in a related context.
        </t>
   <t>Typical control networks today rely on complete physical isolation to
   prevent rogue access to network resources. DetNet enables the virtualization
   of those networks over a converged IT/OT infrastructure. Doing so, DetNet
   introduces an additional risk of flows interacting and interfering with one
   another as they share physical resources such as Ethernet trunks and the
   radio spectrum. The requirement is that there is no possible data leak from
   and into a deterministic flow.  Stated more generally, there is no possible
   influence whatsoever from the outside on a deterministic flow. The expectation
   is that physical resources are effectively associated with a given flow at a
   given point in time. In that
 model, the time&nbhy;sharing of physical resources becomes transparent to
 the individual flows, as these flows have no clue regarding whether
 or not the resources are used by other flows at other times.
   </t>
        <t>The overall security of a deterministic system must cover:
<list style="symbols"> <t> 
       the protection of the signaling protocol
</t><t>
       the authentication and authorization of the controlling nodes, including
       plug-and-play participating end systems
</t><t>
       the identification and shaping of the flows
</t><t>
       the isolation of flows from leakage and other influences from any 
       activity sharing physical resources
