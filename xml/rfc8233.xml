    <abstract>
      <t>In certain networks, such as, but not limited to,
      financial information networks (e.g., stock market data providers), network
   performance criteria (e.g., latency) are becoming as critical to data
   path selection as other metrics and constraints. These metrics are associated with the
      Service Level Agreement (SLA) between customers and service
      providers. The link bandwidth utilization (the total bandwidth of
      a link in actual use for the forwarding) is another important
      factor to consider during path computation.</t>

      <t>IGP Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric Extensions describe mechanisms with
      which network performance information is distributed via
      OSPF and IS-IS, respectively. The Path Computation Element
      Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for
      Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations
      in response to Path Computation Client (PCC) requests. This
      document describes the extension to PCEP to carry latency,
      delay variation, packet loss, and link bandwidth utilization
      as constraints for end-to-end path computation.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>Real-time network performance information is becoming critical in the
      path computation in some networks. Mechanisms to measure latency,
      delay variation, and packet loss in an MPLS network are
      described in <xref target="RFC6374"/>.
      It is important that latency, delay variation, and packet
      loss are considered during the path selection process, even before
      the Label Switched Path (LSP) is set up.</t>

      <t>Link bandwidth utilization based on real-time traffic along
      the path is also becoming critical during path
      computation in some networks. Thus, it is important that the link
      bandwidth utilization is factored in during the path computation.</t>

      <t>The Traffic Engineering Database (TED) is populated with network
      performance information like link latency, delay variation,
      packet loss, as well as parameters related
      to bandwidth (residual bandwidth, available bandwidth, and utilized
      bandwidth) via TE Metric Extensions in OSPF <xref target="RFC7471"/> or
      IS-IS <xref target="RFC7810"/> or via a management system. <xref target="RFC7823"/>
      describes how a Path Computation Element (PCE) <xref target="RFC4655"/>
      can use that information for path selection for explicitly routed
      LSPs.</t>

      <t>A Path Computation Client (PCC)
      can request a PCE to provide a path
      meeting end-to-end network performance criteria. This document
      extends the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
      <xref target="RFC5440"/> to handle network performance constraints
      that include any combination of latency, delay variation,
      packet loss, and bandwidth utilization constraints.</t>
      
      <t><xref target="RFC7471"/> and <xref target="RFC7810"/> 
      describe various considerations regarding: 
      <list style="symbols">
      <t>Announcement thresholds and filters</t>
      <t>Announcement suppression</t>
      <t>Announcement periodicity and network stability</t>
      </list></t>
      <t>The first two provide configurable mechanisms to bound the number
   of re-advertisements in IGP. The third provides a way to throttle 
   announcements. Section 1.2 of <xref target="RFC7823"/> also
   describes the oscillation and stability considerations while 
   advertising and considering service-aware information.</t>

      <section title="Path Delay Metric" toc="default" anchor="sec_pd">

        <t>The Link Delay metric is defined in <xref target="RFC7471"/> and

        The Path Delay metric type of the METRIC object
        in PCEP represents the sum of the Link Delay metric of all links along a P2P
        path. Specifically, extending on the above-mentioned terminology:

    <t>A Path Delay metric for the P2P path P = Sum {D(Lpi), (i=1...K)}. </t>

        <t>A PCC MAY use the Path Delay metric in a Path Computation Request (PCReq) message to request a path
        meeting the end-to-end latency requirement. In this case, the B bit MUST be
        set to suggest a bound (a maximum) for the Path Delay metric that must
        not be exceeded for the PCC to consider the computed path as acceptable.
        The Path Delay metric must be less than or equal to the value specified in the

        <t>A PCC can also use this metric to ask PCE to optimize the path delay during
        path computation.  In this case, the B bit MUST be cleared. </t>

        The Path Delay Variation metric type of the
        METRIC object in PCEP encodes the sum of the Link Delay Variation metric
        of all links along the path. Specifically, extending on the above-mentioned

    <xref target="RFC6049"/> states when this composition function may fail.</t>
  
    <t>Note that the IGP advertisement for link attributes includes the average delay
    variation over a period of time. An implementation, therefore, MAY use the sum of
   the average delay variation of links along a path to derive the 
   delay variation of the path. An end&nbhy;to&nbhy;end bound on delay variation
   is typically used as constraint in the path computation.
    An implementation MAY also use some enhanced
    composition function for computing the delay variation of a path with better accuracy.</t>

        metric that must not be exceeded for the PCC to consider the computed path
        as acceptable.  The path delay variation must be less than or equal to the value
        specified in the metric-value field. </t>

        <t>A PCC can also use this metric to ask the PCE to optimize the path delay variation
        during path computation. In this case, the B flag MUST be cleared. </t>

        <t>A PCE MAY use the Path Delay Variation metric in a PCRep message along with a

          <t> A PCC that wants the PCE to factor in the bandwidth utilization
          during path computation includes a BU object in the PCReq message.
          A PCE that supports this object MUST ensure that no
          link on the computed path has the LBU or LRBU percentage
          exceeding the given value.</t>

          <t>A PCReq or PCRep message MAY contain multiple BU objects so long as
    each is for a different bandwidth utilization type.  If a message
    contains more than one BU object with the same bandwidth utilization
    type, the first MUST be processed by the receiver and subsequent
    instances MUST be ignored.</t>
          
          <t>If the BU object is unknown/unsupported, the PCE is expected to follow
          procedures defined in <xref target="RFC5440"></xref>. That is, if the P bit is set, the
     PCE sends a PCErr message with error type 3 or 4 (Unknown / Not
     supported object) and error value 1 or 2 (unknown / unsupported
     object class / object type), and the related path computation
     request will be discarded.  If the P bit is cleared, the PCE is
     free to ignore the object.</t>

          <t>If the PCE understands but does not support path computation requests using the BU object, and the P bit is set in the BU object header,
          then the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with a PCEP-ERROR
          Object Error-Type = 4 (Not supported object) with Error-value = 5
          (Unsupported network performance constraint), and the related path
     computation request MUST be discarded.</t>

          <t>If the PCE understands the BU object but the local policy has been configured on the PCE to not
          allow network performance constraint, and the P bit is set in the BU object header,
          then the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with a PCEP-ERROR
          Object Error-Type = 5 (Policy violation) with Error-value = 8
          (Not allowed network performance constraint). The path computation request MUST then be
          canceled.</t>

          <t>If path computation is unsuccessful, then a PCE MAY insert a BU object (along with a NO-PATH object) into a PCRep

      <t>Two additional objective functions -- namely,

        These two new objective function codes are defined below.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">

            <t>The bandwidth utilization on link L is denoted u(L).</t>

   an active and a passive stateful PCE.  A passive stateful PCE uses LSP state
   information learned from PCCs to optimize path computations but does

      <section title="Inter-domain Path Computation" toc="default">
        <t><xref target="RFC5441"/> describes the Backward Recursive
        PCE-Based Computation (BRPC) procedure to compute an end-to-end
        optimized inter-domain path by cooperating PCEs. The new metric
        types
        defined in this document can be applied to end-to-end path
        computation, in a similar manner to the existing IGP or TE metrics.
        The new BU object
        defined in this document can be applied to end-to-end path
        computation, in a similar manner to a METRIC object with its B bit set to 1.</t>

        <t>All domains should have the same understanding of the METRIC
        (path delay variation, etc.) and the BU object for end-to-end inter-domain path computation
        to make sense. Otherwise, some form of metric normalization as
        described in <xref target="RFC5441"/> MUST be applied.</t>

        <section title="Inter-AS Links" toc="default">
          <t>The IGP in each neighbor domain can advertise its inter-domain
          TE link capabilities. This has been described in <xref target="RFC5316"/>

          as TE links into the higher-layer network form a Virtual Network Topology
          (VNT). The advertisement into the higher-layer network should include network performance
          link properties based on the end&nbhy;to&nbhy;end metric of the lower-layer LSP. Note that
          the new metrics defined in this document are applied to end-to-end path computation,

      <section title="Reoptimizing Paths" toc="default">
      <t><xref target="RFC6374"/> defines the measurement of loss, delay,
      and related metrics over LSPs. A PCC can
      utilize these measurement techniques. In case it detects a degradation
      of network performance parameters relative to the value of the constraint it gave when the
      path was set up, or relative to an implementation-specific
      threshold, it MAY ask the PCE to reoptimize the path by sending a PCReq with the R bit set in the RP
      object, as per <xref target="RFC5440"/>.</t>

      <t>A PCC may also detect the degradation of an LSP without making any direct measurements,
        by monitoring the TED (as populated by the IGP) for changes in the network performance
        parameters of the links that carry its LSPs.  The PCC can issue a reoptimization request
        for any impacted LSPs.
        For example, a PCC can monitor the link bandwidth utilization along the
        path by monitoring changes in the bandwidth utilization parameters of
        one or more links on the path in the TED. If the bandwidth utilization
        percentage of any of the links in the path changes to a value less
        than that required when the path was set up, or otherwise less
        than an implementation-specific threshold, then the PCC can issue a reoptimization
        request to a PCE.</t>

        <t>A stateful PCE can also determine which LSPs should be reoptimized
        based on network events or triggers from external monitoring systems.
        For example, when a particular link deteriorates and its loss
        increases, this can trigger the stateful PCE to automatically determine
        which LSPs are impacted and should be reoptimized.</t>

<t>
The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. The extensions for stateful PCE provide stateful control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSP) via PCEP, for a model where the PCC delegates control over one or more locally configured LSPs to the PCE. This document describes the creation and deletion of PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model.

The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) defines the mechanisms for the communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or among PCEs. This document describe the usage of Transport Layer Security (TLS) to enhance PCEP security, hence the PCEPS acronym proposed for it. The additional security mechanisms are provided by the transport protocol supporting PCEP, and therefore they do not affect the flexibility and extensibility of PCEP.

    <section title="PCEP Requirements" toc="default" anchor="SEC_R">
      <t>End-to-end service optimization based on latency, delay variation,
      packet loss, and link bandwidth utilization are key requirements
      for service providers. The following associated key requirements are
      identified for PCEP: </t>
      <t>
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>A PCE supporting this specification MUST have the capability to compute
          end-to-end paths with latency, delay variation, packet loss,
          and bandwidth utilization
          constraints. It MUST also support the combination of network
          performance constraints (latency, delay variation, loss,...)
          with existing constraints (cost, hop-limit,...).</t>

          <t>A PCC MUST be able to specify any network performance constraint
          in a PCReq message to be applied during the path computation.</t>

         <t>A PCC MUST be able to request that a PCE optimizes a path using any network performance criteria.</t>

          <t> A PCE that supports this specification is not required to provide
       service-aware path computation to any PCC at any time.
       Therefore, it MUST be possible for a PCE to reject a PCReq
       message with a reason code that indicates service-aware path
       computation is not supported.  Furthermore, a PCE that does not
       support this specification will either ignore or reject such
       requests using pre-existing mechanisms; therefore, the requests
       MUST be identifiable to legacy PCEs, and rejections by legacy
       PCEs MUST be acceptable within this specification.</t>

          <t>A PCE SHOULD be able to return end-to-end network performance
          information of the computed path in a PCRep message.</t>
          <t>A PCE SHOULD be able to compute multi-domain (e.g., Inter-AS,
          Inter-Area, or Multi-Layer) service-aware paths. </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Such constraints are only meaningful if used
      consistently: for instance, if the delay of a computed path segment is
      exchanged between two PCEs residing in different domains, a consistent
      way of defining the delay must be used.</t>
