      <!-- [rfced] Please note that we have made some minor updates to the text in 
the table 1.  Some of these updates were to match the IANA registry, as IANA 
passed us the following note: 

   Note: Please check the text for the registrations carefully.  We revised some 
   of the text that appears in the IANA Note in the announcement. Also, there were 
   a few grammatical corrections made in the descriptions for the status codes.

We made a few additional updates and we will ask IANA to update their registry 
to match the text below if there are no objections and/or other changes.

      <t>IANA has created the "MEDIACTRL Interactive Voice Response Control
      Package Status Codes" registry per this document. New status codes are
      assigned using the Standards Action process defined in <xref
