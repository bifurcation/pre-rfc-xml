  <section title="Introduction">

<t>As indicated in <xref target="OVERVIEW" />, it has been anticipated 
that WebRTC will not remain an isolated island and that some WebRTC endpoints 
will need to communicate with devices used in other existing networks 
with the help of a gateway. Therefore, in order to maximize the possibility of establishing the session without the need for audio transcoding, it is 
recommended in <xref target="RFC7874" /> to include in the offer other suitable audio codecs beyond those that are mandatory to implement.
This document provides some guidelines on the suitable codecs to be considered for WebRTC 
endpoints to address the use cases most relevant to interoperability. 
</t>
<t>The codecs considered in this document are recommended to be supported and included 
in the offer, only for WebRTC endpoints for which interoperability with other non-WebRTC endpoints 
and non-WebRTC-based services is relevant as described in Sections <xref
target="amrwb-use-cases" format="counter"/>, <xref target="amr-use-cases"
format="counter"/>, and <xref target="g722-use-cases" format="counter"/>. 
Other use cases may justify offering other additional codecs to avoid transcoding.

	<section anchor="rationale" title="Rationale for Additional WebRTC Codecs">

	<t>
	The mandatory implementation of Opus <xref target="RFC6716" /> in WebRTC endpoints can guarantee codec interoperability
	(without transcoding) at state-of-the-art voice quality (better than narrow-band "PSTN" 
	quality) between WebRTC endpoints. The WebRTC technology is also expected to be used to communicate with other types of endpoints using other technologies. It can be used for instance 
	as an access technology to VoLTE services (Voice over LTE as specified in <xref target="IR.92" />) or to interoperate with fixed or mobile Circuit-Switched or VoIP services like mobile Circuit-Switched voice over 3GPP 2G/3G mobile networks <xref target="TS23.002"/> or DECT-based VoIP telephony <xref target="EN300175-1"/>. Consequently, a significant number of calls are likely to occur between terminals 
	supporting WebRTC endpoints and other terminals like mobile handsets, fixed VoIP terminals, and 
	DECT terminals that do not support WebRTC endpoints nor implement Opus. As a consequence, these 
	calls are likely to be either of low narrow-band PSTN quality using G.711 <xref target="G.711"/> at both ends or affected 
	by transcoding operations. The drawback of such transcoding operations are listed below:

<list style="symbols">
<t>Degraded user experience with respect to voice quality: voice quality is
significantly degraded by transcoding. For instance, the degradation is around
0.2 to 0.3 MOS for most of the transcoding use cases with AMR-WB codec (<xref target="amrwb"/>) at 12.65 kbit/s and in the same range for other wideband transcoding cases.  It should be stressed that if G.711 is used as a fallback codec for interoperation, wideband voice quality will be lost.  
Such bandwidth reduction effect down to narrow band clearly degrades the user-perceived quality of service leading to shorter and less frequent calls. Such a switch to G.711 
is a choice for customers.  If transcoding is performed between Opus and any
other wideband codec, wideband communication could be maintained but with
degraded quality (MOSs of transcoding between AMR-WB at 12.65 kbit/s and Opus
at 16 kbit/s in both directions are significantly lower than those of AMR-WB
at 12.65 kbit/s or Opus at 16 kbit/s).  Furthermore, in degraded conditions,
the addition of defects, like (a) audio artifacts due to packet losses and (b)
audio effects due to the cascading of different packet loss recovery algorithms, may result in a quality below the acceptable limit for the customers.</t>
<t>Degraded user experience with respect to conversational interactivity: the degradation of conversational interactivity is due to the increase of end-to-end latency for both directions that is introduced by the transcoding operations. Transcoding requires full de-packetization for decoding of the media stream (including mechanisms of de-jitter buffering and packet loss recovery) then re-encoding, re-packetization, and resending.  The delays produced by all these operations are additive and may increase the end-to-end delay up to 1 second, much beyond the acceptable limit.</t>
<t>Additional cost in networks: transcoding places important additional cost on network gateways mainly related to codec implementation, codecs licenses, deployment, testing and validation cost. It must be noted that transcoding of wideband to wideband would require more CPU processing and be more costly than transcoding between narrowband codecs.</t>

<section title="Additional Suitable Codecs for WebRTC">

	<t>
	The following are considered relevant codecs with respect to the general 
	purpose described in <xref target="rationale"/>. This list reflects the current status of foreseen 
	use cases for WebRTC. It is not limitative; it is open to inclusion of other codecs for which 
	relevant use cases can be identified. It's recommended to include codecs (in addition to Opus and G.711) according to the foreseen interoperability cases to be addressed.

			The Adaptive Multi-Rate WideBand (AMR-WB) is a 3GPP-defined speech codec that

			and new multimedia telephony services over IP/IMS. It is specially used for voice over LTE as specified by GSMA in <xref target="IR.92" />. More detailed information on

			<t>
			The market of personal voice communication is driven by mobile terminals. 
			AMR-WB is now very widely implemented in devices and

	<section title="G.722">
		<section title="G.722 General Description">
			<t>
			G.722 <xref target="G.722" /> is an ITU-T-defined wideband speech codec. G.722 was approved 
			by the ITU-T in 1988.  It is a royalty-free codec that is common in a 
			wide range of terminals and endpoints supporting wideband speech 
			and requiring low complexity.  The complexity of G.722 is estimated 
			to 10 MIPS <xref target="EN300175-8" />, which is 2.5 to 3 times lower than AMR-WB. 
			In particular, G.722 has been chosen by ETSI DECT as the mandatory 
			wideband codec for New Generation DECT in order to greatly 
			increase the voice quality by extending the bandwidth from narrow 
			band to wideband. G.722 is the wideband codec required
			for terminals that are certified as CAT-iq 
			DECT, and version 2.0 of the CAT-iq specifications have 
			been approved by GSMA as the minimum requirements for the "HD voice" logo 
			usage on "fixed" devices, i.e., broadband connections using the 
			G.722 codec. 
			</t>
		</section>
		<section anchor="g722-use-cases" title="WebRTC-Relevant Use Case for G.722">
			<t>
			G.722 is the wideband codec required for DECT CAT-iq terminals. 
			DECT cordless phones are still widely used to offer short-range wireless connection to PSTN or VoIP services. G.722 has also been specified by ETSI in 
			<xref target="TS181005" /> as the mandatory wideband codec for IMS multimedia telephony 
			communication service and supplementary services using fixed 
			broadband access. The support of G.722 would consequently allow 
			transcoding-free IP interoperation between WebRTC endpoints and fixed 
			VoIP terminals including DECT CAT-iq terminals supporting G.722. 
			Besides, WebRTC endpoints running on fixed terminals
			that implement G.722 
			may reuse the G.722 codec already implemented on these devices.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Guidelines for G.722 Usage and Implementation with WebRTC">
			<t>
			The payload format to be used for G.722 is defined in
			<xref target="RFC3551"/> with each octet of the stream
			of octets produced by the codec to be octet-aligned in
			an RTP packet. The sampling frequency for the G.722
			codec is 16 kHz, but the RTP clock rate is set to 8000
			Hz in SDP to stay backward compatible with an erroneous definition in the original version of the RTP audio/video profile. Further guidelines for implementing and using G.722 to ensure 
			interoperability with multimedia telephony services over IMS can 
			be found in Section 7 of <xref target="TS26.114"
