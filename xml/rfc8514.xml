<abstract>
<t>This document adds a new capability called "SAVEDATE" to the Internet Message
Access Protocol (IMAP). It defines a new IMAP message attribute called 
'save date' that, unlike the existing 'internal date' attribute, always
indicates the moment at which the message was saved in its current mailbox.
The SAVEDATE capability extends the FETCH command with the means to retrieve the
save date attribute and extends the SEARCH command to allow using the save date
attribute in searching criteria.</t>

<section title="Introduction">
<t>This document extends the Internet Message Access Protocol
(IMAP) <xref target="IMAP4rev1"/> with a new capability called "SAVEDATE".
This capability adds a new IMAP message attribute called 'save date'. The save
date is the date and time at which a message was saved in the mailbox in which
it currently resides. The save date is similar to the existing internal date
attribute in that it is set at the time of delivery. However, the internal date
attribute can be set to an arbitrary value for messages delivered to the mailbox
using the APPEND command and is usually copied from the source message for
messages delivered using the COPY command. In contrast, the save date attribute
is always set to the current date and time at the moment the message is saved in
the mailbox, irrespective of how the message is delivered and from where it
originates.
</t>
<t>The save date message attribute is useful for implementing automated removal
of messages from a mailbox after a configured amount of time. For that
application, it is necessary to know when the message was saved in the mailbox,
which cannot be reliably determined using the internal date attribute.
</t>
<t>For example, a common client usage pattern is to move deleted messages to
a Trash mailbox. These messages are considered "deleted"
at the time they are moved to the Trash mailbox. In an effort to limit the size
of the Trash mailbox, a client may subsequently desire to permanently remove
(expunge) all messages in that Trash mailbox deleted before a certain time
(e.g., a configurable expiration interval). In that case, the internal date
attribute cannot be used since it likely refers to the time at which the
message was originally received. 


<!-- [rfced]  Should "Archiving" here be lowercase? 

Original
   Similar usage patterns can be observed for Archiving
   solutions.

Perhaps
   Similar usage patterns can be observed for archiving
   solutions.
-->

The proper time comparison attribute should
instead be the time at which the message was saved to the Trash mailbox. Similar
usage patterns can be observed for Archiving solutions.
</t>
<t>The SAVEDATE capability extends the FETCH command and response to allow
retrieving the date and time at which a message was saved. Also, the SAVEDATE
capability extends the SEARCH command to allow searching messages with criteria
based on when they were saved in the mailbox.
</t>

<section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
<t>In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected
to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.
</t>

        <t>
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
    described in BCP&nbsp;14 <xref target="KEYWORDS"/> <xref target="KEYWORDS-UPD"/> 
    when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
        </t>


</section>

<section anchor="savedate" title="Save Date Message Attribute">
<t>The save date message attribute is the date and time at which the message was
saved in the mailbox it is now located in. Unlike the internal date
attribute defined by <xref target="IMAP4rev1"/>, this date and time value cannot
be set arbitrarily when a message is delivered by the IMAP APPEND command.
Also, when a message is delivered to the mailbox by the
<xref target="IMAP4rev1">IMAP COPY command</xref> or the
<xref target="IMAP-MOVE">IMAP MOVE command</xref>, the save date
attribute is not copied from the source message. Instead, the current date and
time at which the message is delivered to a mailbox MUST be used to set the
save date attribute. Once calculated, the save date attribute MUST NOT change
as long as the message is contained within the same mailbox.</t>

<t>This means that when the message is copied to another mailbox, the save date
of the message in the source mailbox remains unaffected; only the new copy of the
message gets a new save date. Consequently, when the message is moved to
another mailbox, either using the MOVE command or a command sequence involving
the COPY command <xref target="IMAP-MOVE"/>, the message always gets a new
save date in the destination mailbox.
</t>
<t>For some specific mailboxes, the underlying storage may not support the save
date message attribute. The handling of this situation is described in detail in
the next section for each involved IMAP command.

<section anchor="changes-capability" title="CAPABILITY Identification">
<t>IMAP servers that support this extension MUST include "SAVEDATE" in the
response list to the CAPABILITY command.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="changes-fetch" title="FETCH Command and Response Extensions">
<t>This extension defines one new data item for the FETCH command:
<list style="hanging">
  <t hangText="SAVEDATE"><vspace blankLines="0"/>
  The save date of the message.
  </t>
</list>
</t>
<t>This extension defines one new data item for the FETCH response:
<list style="hanging">
  <t hangText="SAVEDATE"><vspace blankLines="0"/>
  A string representing the save date of the message. However, if the underlying
  mailbox storage does not support the save date message attribute, the value
  returned for the SAVEDATE item is always NIL, rather than a string.
  </t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Example:</t>
<?rfc needLines="4" ?>
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      C: A101 FETCH 998 (SAVEDATE)
      S: * 998 FETCH (SAVEDATE "01-Jan-2015 18:50:53 +0100")
      S: A101 OK Fetch completed.
]]></artwork></figure>
</section>

<section anchor="changes-search" title="SEARCH Command Extension">
<t> This extension defines four new search keys for the SEARCH command:
<list style="hanging">
  <t hangText="SAVEDBEFORE &lt;date&gt;"><vspace blankLines="0"/>
	Messages whose save date (disregarding time and timezone) is earlier than
	the specified date.
	</t>
  <t hangText="SAVEDON &lt;date&gt;"><vspace blankLines="0"/>
	Messages whose save date (disregarding time and timezone) is within the
	specified date.
	</t>
  <t hangText="SAVEDSINCE &lt;date&gt;"><vspace blankLines="0"/>
	Messages whose save date (disregarding time and timezone) is within or
	later than the specified date.
	</t>
  <t hangText="SAVEDATESUPPORTED"><vspace blankLines="0"/>
	Matches all messages in the mailbox when the underlying storage of that
	mailbox supports the save date attribute. Conversely, it matches no
	messages in the mailbox when the save date attribute is not supported.
	</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>When the underlying storage of a mailbox does not support the save date
attribute, the SAVEDBEFORE, SAVEDON, and SAVEDSINCE search keys MUST use the
internal date attribute instead. In the context of the
<xref target="MULTISEARCH">IMAP Multimailbox SEARCH Extension</xref>,
this fallback behavior MUST apply to each mailbox individually, meaning that
only the mailboxes that lack support for the save date attribute use the
internal date attribute instead.</t>
<t>Example:</t>
<?rfc needLines="7" ?>
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      C: A102 SEARCH SAVEDON 28-Dec-2014
      S: * SEARCH 993 994
      S: A102 OK Search completed.
      C: A103 SEARCH SAVEDSINCE 28-Dec-2014
      S: * SEARCH 993 994 995 996 997 998 999 1000 1001
