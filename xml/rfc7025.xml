        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>The initial effort of the PCE (Path Computation Element) WG
focused mainly on solving the path computation problem within a domain or over
different domains in MPLS networks. As with MPLS, service providers (SPs) have
also come up with requirements for path computation in GMPLS-controlled
networks <xref target="RFC3945"/>, such as those 
based on Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), Time Division Multiplexing 
(TDM), or Ethernet.</t>
	    <t><xref target="RFC4655"/> and <xref target="RFC4657"/> discuss the framework and requirements for PCE on both packet MPLS networks and GMPLS-controlled networks. This document complements those RFCs by providing considerations of GMPLS applications in the intradomain and interdomain networking environments and indicating a set of requirements for the extended definition of PCE-related protocols.</t>
       	    <t>Note that the requirements for interlayer and inter-area traffic
engineering (TE) described in <xref target="RFC6457"/> and <xref target="RFC4927"/> are outside of the scope of this document.</t>

	    <t>Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) computation within a
domain or over domains for signaling GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) is
usually more stringent than that of MPLS TE LSPs <xref target="RFC4216"/>,
because the additional constraints, e.g., interface switching capability, link
encoding, link protection capability, Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) <xref
target="RFC4202"/>, and so forth, need to be considered to establish GMPLS
LSPs. The GMPLS signaling protocol <xref target="RFC3473"/> is designed taking into account bidirectionality, switching type, encoding type, and protection attributes of the TE links spanned by the path, as well as LSP encoding and switching type of the endpoints, appropriately.</t>
	    <t>This document provides requirements for GMPLS applications of PCE in support of GMPLS path computation, included are requirements for both intradomain and interdomain environments. </t>
        </section>

	<section title="GMPLS Applications of PCE" anchor="GMPLS_App">
	<section title="Path Computation in GMPLS Networks">
	    <t><xref target="fig_pathcomp"/> depicts a model GMPLS network, consisting of an ingress link, a transit link, as well as an egress link. We will use this model to investigate consistent guidelines for GMPLS path computation. Each link at each interface has its own switching capability, encoding type, and bandwidth.</t>

	<figure title="Path Computation in GMPLS Networks" anchor="fig_pathcomp">

	<t>For the simplicity in consideration, the following basic assumptions
are made when the LSP is created.

<list style="format (%d)">
	<t>Switching capabilities of outgoing links from the ingress and egress
nodes (link1-2 and link4-3 in <xref target="fig_pathcomp"/>) are consistent with each other.</t>
	<t>Switching capabilities of all transit links, including incoming links to the ingress and egress nodes (link2-1 and link3-4) are consistent with switching type of an LSP to be created.</t>
	<t>Encoding types of all transit links are consistent with the encoding
type of an LSP to be created.</t>
</list></t>

	<t>GMPLS-controlled networks (e.g., GMPLS-based TDM networks) are usually responsible for transmitting data for
the client layer. These GMPLS-controlled networks can provide different types
of connections for customer services based on different service bandwidth
requests.</t>

<t>
The applications and the corresponding additional requirements for applying PCE
to GMPLS-based TDM networks are described in this section.  In order to
simplify the description, this document only discusses the scenario in
Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) networks as an example (see <xref target="fig_simpletdm"/>). The scenarios in
Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) or Optical Transport Network (OTN) are similar.</t>

    <t><xref target="fig_simpletdm"/> 
 shows a simple TDM (SDH) network topology, where N1, N2, N3, N4, and
N5 are all SDH switches; A1 and A2 are client devices (e.g.,
Ethernet switches).
 Assume that one Ethernet service with 100 Mbit/s bandwidth is required from A1
to A2 over this network. 
The client Ethernet service could be provided by a Virtual Container 4 (VC-4)
container from N1 to N4; it could also be provided by three concatenated VC-3s
(contiguous or virtual concatenation) from N1 to N4.
</t>

    <t> 
In this scenario, when the ingress node (e.g., N1) receives a client service
transmitting request, the type of containers (one VC-4 or three concatenated VC-3s) could be determined by the PCC (Path Computation Client), e.g., N1
or Network Management System (NMS).  However, it could also be determined
automatically by the PCE based on policy <xref target="RFC5394"/>.

If it is determined by the PCC, then the PCC
should be capable of specifying the ingress node and egress node, signal type,
the type of the concatenation, and the number of the concatenation in a PCReq
(Path Computation Request) message. The PCE should consider those parameters
during path computation. 

The route information (co-routing or diverse routing) should be specified in a PCRep (Path Computation Reply) message if path computation is performed successfully.</t> 
    <t>As described above, the PCC should be capable of specifying TE
attributes defined in the next section, and the PCE should compute a path accordingly.</t>
    <t>Where a GMPLS network consists of interdomain (e.g., inter-AS or inter-area) GMPLS-controlled networks, requirements on the path computation follow <xref target="RFC5376"/> and <xref target="RFC4726"/>.</t>
	</section>

        <section title="Unnumbered Interface">
	<t>GMPLS supports unnumbered interface IDs as defined in <xref
target="RFC3477"/>; this means that the endpoints of the path may be unnumbered. It should also be possible to request a path consisting of the mixture of numbered links and unnumbered links, or a P2MP (Point-to-Multipoint) path with different types of endpoints. Therefore, the PCC should be capable of indicating the unnumbered interface ID of the endpoints in the PCReq message.</t>
	</section>

	<section title="Asymmetric Bandwidth Path Computation">
	  <t>Per <xref target="RFC6387"/>, GMPLS signaling can be used for
setting up an asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSP. If a PCE is responsible
for path computation, it should be capable of computing a path for the bidirectional LSP with asymmetric bandwidth. This means that the PCC should be able to indicate the asymmetric bandwidth requirements in forward and reverse directions in the PCReq message.</t>
	</section>
	</section>

	<section title="Requirements for GMPLS Applications of PCE">
        <section title="Requirements on Path Computation Request" anchor="Req_Path">
	    <t>As for path computation in GMPLS-controlled networks as
discussed in <xref target="GMPLS_App" />, the PCE should appropriately
consider the GMPLS TE attributes listed below once a PCC or another PCE
requests a path computation. The path calculation request message from the PCC
or the PCE must contain the information specifying appropriate
attributes. According to <xref target="RFC5440"/>, <xref
target="PCE-WSON-REQ"/>, and RSVP procedures such as explicit label control
(ELC), the additional attributes introduced are as follows:

<list style="format (%d)">
	<t>Switching capability/type: as defined in <xref target="RFC3471"/>, <xref target="RFC4203"/>, and all current and future values.</t>
	<t>Encoding type: as defined in <xref target="RFC3471"/>, <xref target="RFC4203"/>, and all current and future values.</t>
	<t>Signal type: as defined in <xref target="RFC4606"/> and all current and future values.</t>


<t> Concatenation type: In SDH/SONET and OTN, two kinds of concatenation modes
are defined: contiguous concatenation, which requires co-routing for each
member signal and that all the interfaces along the path support this
capability, and virtual concatenation, which allows diverse routing for member
signals and requires that only the ingress and egress interfaces support this
capability.

Note that for the virtual concatenation, it may also specify
co-routing or diverse routing. See <xref target="RFC4606"/> and <xref target="RFC4328"/> about concatenation information.</t>
	<t>Concatenation number: Indicates the number of signals that are 
       requested to be contiguously or virtually concatenated. Also see <xref target="RFC4606"/> and <xref target="RFC4328"/>.</t>
	<t>Technology-specific label(s): as defined in <xref target="RFC4606"/>, <xref target="RFC6060"/>, <xref target="RFC6002"/>, or <xref target="RFC6205"/>.</t>
	<t>End-to-End (E2E) path protection type: as defined in <xref target="RFC4872"/>, e.g., 1+1 
       protection, 1:1 protection, (pre-planned) rerouting, etc.</t>
	<t>Administrative group: as defined in <xref target="RFC3630"/>.</t>
	<t>Link protection type: as defined in <xref target="RFC4203"/>.</t>
	<t>Support for unnumbered interfaces: as defined in <xref target="RFC3477"/>.</t>
	<t>Support for asymmetric bandwidth requests: as defined in <xref target="RFC6387"/>.</t>
        <t>Support for explicit label control during the path computation.</t>
        <t>Support of label restrictions in the requests/responses, similar to RSVP-TE ERO (Explicit Route Object) and XRO (Exclude Route Object), as
defined in <xref target="RFC3473"/> and <xref target="RFC4874"/>.</t>
</list></t>
	</section>

        <section title="Requirements on Path Computation Reply">
	    <t>As described above, a PCE should compute the path that satisfies
the constraints specified in the PCReq message. Then, the PCE should send a
PCRep message, including the computation result, to the PCC. For a Path
Computation Reply message (PCRep) in GMPLS networks, there are some additional
requirements. The PCEP (PCE communication protocol) PCRep message must be
extended to meet the following requirements.

<list style="format (%d)">
       <t>Path computation with concatenation
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
       In the case of path computation involving concatenation, when a PCE
receives the PCReq message specifying the concatenation constraints described
in <xref target="Req_Path" />, the PCE should compute a path accordingly.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
	For path computation involving contiguous concatenation, a single route is required, and all the interfaces along the route should support contiguous concatenation capability. Therefore, the PCE should compute a path based on the contiguous concatenation capability of each interface and only one ERO that should carry the route information for the response.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
       For path computation involving virtual concatenation, only the
ingress/egress interfaces need to support virtual concatenation capability, and
there may be diverse routes for the different member signals. Therefore,
multiple EROs may be needed for the response. 

 Each ERO may represent the route of one or multiple
 member signals.  When one ERO represents multiple
 member signals, the number must be specified.
</t>

       <t>Label constraint
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
       In the case that a PCC does not specify the exact label(s) when
requesting a label-restricted path and the PCE is capable of performing the
route computation and label assignment computation procedure, the PCE needs to
be able to specify the label of the path in a PCRep message.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
       Wavelength restriction is a typical case of label restriction. More
generally, label switching and selection constraints may apply in
GMPLS-controlled networks, and a PCC may request a PCE to take label constraint into account and return an ERO containing the label or set of labels that fulfill the PCC request.</t>

       <t>Roles of the routes
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
       When a PCC specifies the protection type of an LSP, the PCE should
compute the working route and the corresponding protection route(s). Therefore,
the PCRep should allow to distinguish the working (nominal) and the protection
routes. According to these routes, the RSVP-TE procedure appropriately creates
both the working and the protection LSPs, for example, with the ASSOCIATION object
<xref target="RFC6689"/>.</t>

</list></t>

        <section title="GMPLS PCE Management">

            <t>This document does not change any of the management or
operational details for networks that utilize PCE. (Please refer to <xref target="RFC4655"/> for manageability considerations
for a PCE-based architecture.) However, this document proposes the introduction of several PCEP
objects and data for the better integration of PCE with GMPLS networks. Those
protocol elements will need to be visible in any management tools that apply to
the PCE, PCC, and PCEP. That includes, but is not limited to, adding appropriate
objects to existing PCE MIB modules that are used for modeling and monitoring
PCEP deployments <xref target="PCEP-MIB"/>.  Ideas for what objects are needed may
be guided by the relevant GMPLS extensions in GMPLS-TE-STD-MIB <xref target="RFC4802"/>.
</t>
        </section>
	</section>

        <section title="Security Considerations">
        <t>PCEP extensions to support GMPLS should be considered under the same security as current PCE work, and this extension will not change the underlying security issues. Section 10 of <xref target="RFC5440"/> describes the list of security considerations in PCEP. At the time <xref target="RFC5440"/> was published, TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) had not been fully specified for securing the TCP connections that underlie PCEP sessions. TCP-AO <xref target="RFC5925"/> has now been published, and PCEP implementations should fully support TCP-AO according to <xref target="RFC6952"/>.</t>

memo provides application-specific requirements for the Path Computation
Element communication Protocol (PCEP) for the support of Wavelength Switched
Optical Networks (WSON). Lightpath provisioning in WSONs requires a routing and
wavelength assignment (RWA) process. From a path computation perspective,
wavelength assignment is the process of determining which wavelength can be
used on each hop of a path and forms an additional routing constraint to
optical light path computation. Requirements for Optical impairments will be
addressed in a separate document.</t></abstract></front><seriesInfo
