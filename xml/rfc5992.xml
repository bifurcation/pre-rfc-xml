   <section title="Introduction" anchor="Intro">
      <t>Cyrillic is one of a fairly small number of scripts that are
         used, with different subsets of characters, to write a large
         number of languages, some of which are not closely related to
         the others.  When those languages might be used together in a
         zone (typical of generic TLDs (gTLDs) but likely in other
         zones both at and below the root), special considerations for
         intermixing characters may apply.  Cyrillic also has the
         property that, while it is usually considered a separate
         script from the Latin (Roman) and Greek ones, it shares many
         characters with them, creating opportunities for visual
         confusion. Those difficulties are especially pronounced when
		 "all of Cyrillic" is used rather than only the characters
		 associated with a particular language.</t>
      <t>This specification provides guidelines for the use of
         Cyrillic, as encoded in
         <xref target="Unicode52">Unicode</xref> with
		 internationalized domain name (IDN) labels derived
         from most "European" languages 
         that use the script (use of the term "European" is a
         convenience, since there is disagreement about the relevant
         boundaries for different purposes and, of course, much of
         Russia lies within geological Asia).  

Specifically, it covers
         (in alphabetic 
         order) Bosnian, Bulgarian, Byelorussian, the Kildin member of
		 the Sami (often written "Saami") language family, Macedonian,
         Montenegrin, Russian, Serbian, and
         Ukrainian.  Supplemental tables, based on information in the
         Unicode Standard <!-- the Omniglot discussion of
         Moldovan <xref target="OmniglotMoldovan"/>,--> and a
		 recently completed Montenegrin government standard
		 <xref target="MontenegrinChars"/>
	 <!-- and Sami languages <xref target="OmniglotSaami"/> -->
		 are provided for use with Montenegrin.  Moldovan is no longer in
         official use with Cyrillic script: no registrations are
         considered likely in Cyrillic, at least within the
         relevant ccTLD, and it is not further discussed in this
		 document.  <!-- [JcK] Moldovan text changed 20100914 -->
		 Languages of Asia that use Cyrillic are not
         considered here and should be the subject of separate
         specifications.</t>
      <t>While Cyrillic script is the primary one used for many of the
         relevant languages and countries, Latin script is often used
         instead of, or in combination with, it.  Standard keyboards
         used in most of the countries have both Cyrillic and Latin
         characters. Therefore, some registries could use Latin
         scripts for domain name registration in their zones.  From
		 time to time, some registries and users have claimed that
		 there is a requirement for mixing Cyrillic and Latin
		 characters in the same label.  We strongly recommend against
		 such mixing as user confusion is almost certain to result.  In addition,
         registries that support many scripts will probably encounter
         the need to support labels in Greek or Latin scripts as well
         as Cyrillic, and a large number of character forms are shared
         among those three scripts. </t>
      <t>Because the DNS has no way for the end user to distinguish
         among the languages that might have been used to inspire a
         particular label, it seems useful to treat the characters of
         a large number of languages that use Cyrillic in their
         writing systems together, rather than trying to differentiate
         them.  The discussion and tables in this specification should
         provide a foundation for developing more restrictive rules
         for zones in which only a single language is likely to be
         used, but it does not specify those language-specific
         rules.</t>
	  <t>Readers of this document should be aware that its
		 recommendations are about use in DNS labels.  The orthography
		 for some of the languages involved, especially Kildin Sami, is not completely
		 standardized and local usage sometimes permits substitution
		 of Latin-based characters for their Cyrillic equivalents.
		 Unless they are required by official orthographies, those
		 substitutions should generally be avoided in DNS labels 
		 because of the risk of additional user confusion with the
		  Latin characters that are visually similar.</t>

        <section title="Similar Characters and Variants">
          <t>For some human languages, there are characters and/or
             strings that have 
             equivalent or near-equivalent meanings. If someone is allowed to
             register a name with such a character or string, the registry might want
             to automatically register all the names that have the same meaning in
             that language. Further, some registries might want to restrict the set
             of characters to be registered for language-based
             reasons. </t>

          <t>So-called "variant techniques", introduced in the JET
 specification for the CJK script <xref target="RFC3743"/> and its
 generalization <xref target="RFC4290"/>, describe ways of registering
 IDNs to decrease the risk of misunderstandings, cybersquatting, and
 other forms of confusion.</t>

          <t>The tables below (<xref target="CharTables"/>) identify
             confusable characters in Latin and Greek scripts that
             might be easily confused with Cyrillic ones.</t>
		  <t>As with variant approaches for other scripts
			 (e.g., see <xref target="RFC4713">RFC 4713</xref> for the Chinese
			 language or 
			 <xref target="RFC5564">RFC 5564</xref> for the Arabic
				language), this document identifies sets of
			 characters that need special consideration and provides
			 information about them.  A registry that handles names
			 using these characters can then make a policy decision
			 about how to actually handle them.   The options for
			 those policy decisions would include automatically
			 registering all look-alike strings to the same registrant,
			 registering one such string and blocking the others,
			 and so on.</t>
<!--
    <t>In a view of 16 Cyrillic characters (U+0430,U+432,U+433,U+0435,U+438,U+043A,
    U+043C,U+043D,U+043E,U+043F,U+0440,U+0441,U+442,U+0443,U+0445,U+0456) are similar 
    to latin characters U+0061,U+0062,U+0072,U+0065,U+0075,U+006B,

    a technology described in [FRAMEWORK] is useful for IDN domains registration
    in Cyrillic zones.</t> -->

   <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The terminology that follows is derived from the JET
 specification for the CJK script
         <xref target="RFC3743"/> and its generalization
         <xref target="RFC4290"/>, but this specification does not
         depend on them.   All characters listed here have been
		 verified to be "PVALID" under the IDNA2008
		 specification <xref target="RFC5890"/> <xref target="RFC5892"/>.</t>


      <t>A "string" is a sequence of one or more characters.</t>
	      <!-- See note from Bob Braden 20100201 -->

      <t>This document discusses characters that have equivalent or
        near-equivalent characters or strings. The "base character" is the
        character that has one or more equivalents; the "variant(s)" are the
        character(s) and/or string(s) that are equivalent to the base
        character.</t>

        <t>A "registration bundle" is the set of all labels that comes from
        expanding all base characters for a single name into their
        variants.</t>

        <t>A registry is the administrative authority for a DNS zone. That is, the
        registry is the body that makes and enforces policies that are used in a
        particular zone in the DNS.  The term "registry" applies to all zones
        in the DNS, not only those that exist at the top level.</t>

      <section title="Languages and Characters">
         <t>In the interest of clarity and balance, this document
            describes a "Base Cyrillic" set of 23
            characters for use in comparing the character usage for
            Russian and Central European languages that use Cyrillic.
            The balance of this section compares the character usage
            of the individual languages in that group.</t>
         <t>"Base Cyrillic" consists of the following Unicode code
            points (names associated with these code points and those
            below appear in <xref target="CharTables"/>):
            U+0430, U+0431, U+0432, U+0433, U+0434, U+0435, U+0436,
            U+0437, U+043A, U+043B, U+043C, U+043D, U+043E, U+043F,
            U+0440, U+0441, U+0442, U+0443, U+0444, U+0445, U+0446,
            U+0447, U+0448.</t>
		 <t>In addition, modern writing systems that use Cyrillic do
			not have digits separate from the "European" ones used
			with Latin characters.   For registries that permit digits
			to appear in domain name labels, the "Base Cyrillic" code
			point listed above should be considered to include
			U+0030, U+0031, U+0032, U+0033, U+0034, U+0035,
			U+0036, U+0037, U+0038, and U+0039 (Digit Zero, and Digit One
			through Digit Nine).
			<!-- [JcK] I question the comma after "Zero" above after
			   your rewrite of this sentence, but suit yourselves --> 
			The Hyphen-Minus character (U+002D)
			may also be used.</t>
		 <t>It is worth noting that the EU top-level domain registry
			allows Cyrillic registrations using 32 code points
			<xref target="EU-registry"/>.  That list is sufficient for
			some of the languages listed here but not for others.</t>
         <t>The individual languages that are the focus of this
			specification are discussed below (in English
			alphabetical order).</t>

		   <section title="Kildin Sami">
			  <t>The phonetics of the Kildin Sami are quite complex
				 and not easily represented in Cyrillic
				 (see, e.g., Kertom's work <xref target="Kert"/>).  The orthography is
				 not standardized and the writing system may best be
				 thought of as an attempt to transcribe the language
				 phonetically (primary in Latin script in the 1930s
				 but in Cyrillic more recently). Different scholars have reported
				 different numbers of phonemes, further complicating
				 the transcription process.   Kertom
				 identifies 53 consonants with long-short distinctions
				 and, in many cases, hard-soft ones.  He also
				 identifies ascending and descending diphthongs and

  There are no known keyboards designed specifically for
  Kildin Sami.  If an extended Latin-based keyboard and
  associated software are used, these characters might appear
  with the code point based on
  Latin (e.g., U+0113 for the second case).  By contrast,
  keyboards and input software that are designed to be more
  Cyrillic-friendly are more likely to produce code points for
  the Cyrillic base characters.  The use of a Latin character
  base for that second case occurs in some Western European
  sources including Riessler's work  <xref target="Riessl07"/>.  While we have
  not found explicit substitutions for A with Macron, we
  believe they might be found in practice. These alternatives
  are not mapped together by Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC) (or
Normalization Form KC (NFKC)), so registries, and possibly applications
  software, should exercise some care about these coding
  variations.

				 However, U+0101 and U+0113 are Latin Script
				 characters so, if either
				 is used, any tests on homogeneity of the script
				 within a label need to be made with care.

		      <t>The key references in Russian
				 (<xref target="Anto90"/>,
				 <xref target="Kert86"/>,
				 <xref target="Kuru85"/>) all propose slightly
				 different character tables relative to each other
				 and to Riessler's list.  Because the latter list
				 appears to be more comprehensive and to represent
				 more recent scholarship, we have based the tables in
				 this document on it.  We recommend, however, that
				 registries review these recommendations and the
				 relevant papers should registration requests for
				 Kildin Sami actually appear.</t>

             <t>The character list for modern Ukrainian has apparently

<section title="Language-Based Tables">
   <t>The registration strategy described in this document uses a table that
    lists all characters allowed for input and any variants of those
    characters. Note that the table lists all characters allowed, not only
    the ones that have variants.</t>

<!-- <t>The tables are language-specific, although it is possible to create a
    single table that covers multiple languages.   The following three
    sub-sections describe the use of tables. </t> -->

 <!--
<section title="Tables for zones that use names from single language
     (Annexes I,III,V,VII)">
       <t>These tables constructed without variants. Its have the base characters
    of the language used in the zone, digits 0-9 and hyphen.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Table for common zones that use names from four cyrillic languages
     (Annexes IX)">
       <t>This table constructed without variants and has the base characters of
    four languages used in the zone, digits 0-9 and hiphen.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Tables for zones that use names from cyrillic languages and using
    base latin set. (Annexes II,IV,VI,VIII,X)">
       <t>This tables constructed with variants for overlapped latin characters
    and has the base characters of cyrillic languages, base latin set,
    digits 0-9 and hiphen.</t>
    </section>  -->
</section>

<section title="Table Processing Rules">
   <t>The input to the process is called the "input label". The output of the
	process is either failure (the input label cannot be registered at all),
	or a registration bundle that contains one or more labels in A-label
	form.</t>
</section>

<section title="Table Format">
   <t>The table in <xref target="CharTables"/> consists of four
      columns.  The first and second identify the Cyrillic character,
      and the third and fourth identify Latin or Greek characters that
      might be easily confused with them visually.   If both a Latin
      and Greek character are present, the Greek one appears in the
      third and fourth columns on the subsequent line (with "..." in
      the first column to indicate more information about the
      character specified on the previous line).  Variants needed only
	  because of case folding are shown with "+++" in the first
	  column, as noted in the table.</t> 
   <t>Each character in the table is given in the "U+" notation for Unicode
        characters followed, in the next column, by its name as shown in
        the Unicode Standard. For easy reference, the characters are
        listed in the order in which they appear in the Unicode
        Standard.</t>
   <t>The table does not, and any future revision MUST NOT, have more
	  than one entry for a particular base character.</t>
</section>

<section title="Steps after Registering an Input Label">

   <t>A registry has at least three policy options for handling the
      cases where the registration bundle has more than one label.
      These options, and their key implications, are:
   <list style="symbols">
      <t>Allocate all labels to the same registrant, making the zone
         information identical to that of the input label.
         <vspace blankLines="1"/>
         This option will cause end users to be able to find names
         with variants more easily, but will result in larger zone
         files. In principle, the zone file could become so large that it
         could negatively affect the ability of the registry to perform name
         resolution. </t>
     <t>Block all labels so they cannot be registered in the
        future.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        This option does not increase the size of the zone file, but
        it may cause end users to not be able to find names with
        variants that they would expect.</t> 
     <t>Allocate some labels and block some other labels.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        This option is likely to cause the most confusion with users
        because including some variants will cause a name to be
        found, but using other variants will cause the name to be
        not found.</t>
     </list></t>
     <t>With any of these three options, the registry MUST keep a database that
        links each label in the registration bundle to the input label. This link
        needs to be maintained so that changes in the non-DNS registration
        information (such as the label's owner name and address) are reflected in
        every member of the registration bundle as well.</t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">
   <t>The information provided in this document may assist DNS zone administrators
      and registrants in selecting names that are less likely to be confused with
      others and in adopting policies that help avoid confusion.  It may also assist
      user-interface designers in identifying possible areas of confusion so that they
      can better protect users.  The document otherwise has no consequences for the
      security of the Internet.</t>

             title="European Cyrillic Character Tables">

      <t>
	These tables are constructed on the basis of the
	characters that can actually occur in the DNS, i.e.,
	those that are valid in U-labels as defined in RFC 5890.

         If the characters that can be mapped 
         into those characters are to be considered instead, then the
         number of variants would increase considerably.  For example,
         while CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER A (U+0430) and GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA (U+03B1)
         are readily distinguished visually, their capital letter
         equivalents are not, so, if case mappings such as those discussed in
         the IDNA2008 Mapping document <xref target="RFC5895"/> are considered,
         the two small letters must be considered variants of each other. 
         Some of the variants have been selected on the
	 assumption that unusual fonts may be used and that users will see what
         they expect to see; others, involving subtle decorations but
	 considered more far-fetched out of context, have not been listed.</t>
	  <t>These additional, possibly required, variants are shown below
		 with "+++" in the first column of the table.</t>

<t>
"..." in the first column is used to indicate more information
about the character specified on the previous line.
