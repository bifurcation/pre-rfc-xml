   This document updates the Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic
   Engineering (RSVP-TE) Fast Reroute (FRR) procedures defined in RFC&nbsp;4090 to support Packet Switch Capable (PSC) Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  These
   updates allow the coordination of a bidirectional bypass tunnel
   assignment protecting a common facility in both forward and reverse
   directions of a co-routed bidirectional LSP.  In addition, these
   updates enable the redirection of bidirectional traffic onto bypass
   tunnels that ensure the co-routing of data paths in the forward and
   reverse directions after FRR and avoid RSVP soft-state timeout in
   the control plane.</t>

	<section title="Introduction" anchor="section-1"><t>
   Packet Switch Capable (PSC) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs) can be set up using Generalized Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (GMPLS) signaling procedures specified in <xref target="RFC3473"/> for
   both unidirectional and bidirectional tunnels.  The GMPLS signaling
   allows sending and receiving the RSVP messages in-band with the data
   traffic or out-of-band over a separate control channel.  Fast Reroute
   (FRR) <xref target="RFC4090"/> has been widely deployed in the packet TE networks
   today and is desirable for TE GMPLS LSPs.  Using FRR methods also
   allows the leveraging of existing mechanisms for failure
   detection and restoration in deployed networks.</t>

	<t>
   The FRR procedures defined in <xref target="RFC4090"/> describe the behavior of the
   Point of Local Repair (PLR) to reroute traffic and signaling onto the
   bypass tunnel in the event of a failure for protected LSPs.  Those
   procedures are applicable to the unidirectional protected LSPs
   signaled using either RSVP-TE <xref target="RFC3209"/> or GMPLS procedures
   <xref target="RFC3473"/>.  When using the FRR procedures defined in <xref target="RFC4090"/> with
   co-routed bidirectional GMPLS LSPs, it is desired that same PLR and
   Merge Point (MP) pairs are selected in each direction and that both PLR
   and MP assign the same bidirectional bypass tunnel.  This document
   updates the FRR procedures defined in <xref target="RFC4090"/> to coordinate the
   bidirectional bypass tunnel assignment and to exchange MP labels
   between upstream and downstream PLRs of the protected co-routed
   bidirectional LSP.</t>

	<t>
   When using FRR procedures with co-routed bidirectional GMPLS LSPs, it
   is possible in some cases for the RSVP signaling refreshes to stop
   reaching certain nodes along the protected LSP path after the PLRs
   finish rerouting of the signaling messages.  This can occur after a
   failure event when using node protection bypass tunnels.  As shown in
   <xref target="fig2"/>, this is possible even with selecting the same bidirectional
   bypass tunnels in both directions and the same PLR and MP pairs.
   This is caused by the asymmetry of paths that may be taken by the
   bidirectional LSP's signaling in the forward and reverse directions
   due to upstream and downstream PLRs independently triggering FRR.  In
   such cases, after FRR, the RSVP soft-state timeout causes the
   protected bidirectional LSP to be torn down, with subsequent traffic
   loss.</t>

	<t>
   Protection State Coordination Protocol <xref target="RFC6378"/> is applicable to FRR
   <xref target="RFC4090"/> for local protection of co-routed bidirectional LSPs in
   order to minimize traffic disruptions in both directions.  However,
   this does not address the above-mentioned problem of RSVP soft-state
   timeout that can occur in the control plane.</t>

	<t>This document defines a solution to the RSVP soft-state timeout issue
   by providing mechanisms in the control plane to complement the FRR
   procedures of <xref target="RFC4090"/>. This solution allows the RSVP soft state for co-routed, 
       protected bidirectional GMPLS LSPs to be maintained in the 
       control plane and enables co-routing of the traffic paths
       in the forward and reverse directions after FRR.</t>

	<t>The procedures defined in this document apply to PSC TE co-routed,
	protected bidirectional LSPs and co-routed bidirectional FRR bypass
	tunnels both signaled by GMPLS. Unless otherwise specified in this
	document, the FRR procedures defined in <xref target="RFC4090"/> are
	not modified by this document.  The FRR mechanism for associated
	bidirectional GMPLS LSPs where two unidirectional GMPLS LSPs are bound
        together by using association signaling <xref target="RFC7551"/> is 
        outside the scope of this document.</t>

   The FRR procedures defined in <xref target="RFC4090"/> for RSVP-TE signaling
   <xref target="RFC3209"/> are equally applicable to the unidirectional protected LSPs
   signaled using GMPLS <xref target="RFC3473"/> and are not modified by the updates

	<t>
   When using the GMPLS out-of-band signaling <xref target="RFC3473"/>, after a link

	<section title="Bypass Tunnel Assignment for Bidirectional GMPLS LSPs" anchor="section-4"><t>
   This section describes signaling procedures for FRR bidirectional
   bypass tunnel assignment for GMPLS signaled PSC co-routed
   bidirectional TE LSPs for both in-band and out-of-band signaling.</t>

	<section title="Bidirectional GMPLS Bypass Tunnel Direction" anchor="section-4.1"><t>
   This document defines procedures where bidirectional GMPLS bypass
   tunnels are signaled in the same direction as the protected GMPLS
   LSPs.  In other words, the bidirectional GMPLS bypass tunnels
   originate on the downstream PLRs and terminate on the corresponding
   downstream MPs.  As the originating downstream PLR has the policy
   information about the locally provisioned bypass tunnels, it always
   initiates the bypass tunnel assignment.  The bidirectional GMPLS
   bypass tunnels originating from the upstream PLRs and terminating on
   the corresponding upstream MPs are outside the scope of this
   document.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Merge Point Labels" anchor="section-4.2"><t>
   To correctly reroute data traffic over a node protection bypass
   tunnel, the downstream and upstream PLRs have to know, in advance,
   the downstream and upstream MP labels of the protected LSP so that
   data in the forward and reverse directions can be redirected through
   the bypass tunnel after FRR, respectively.</t>

	<t>
   <xref target="RFC4090"/> defines procedures for the downstream PLR to obtain the
   protected LSP's downstream MP label from recorded labels in the
   RECORD_ROUTE Object (RRO) of the RSVP Resv message received at the
   downstream PLR.</t>

	<t>
   To obtain the upstream MP label, the procedures specified in
   <xref target="RFC4090"/> are used to record the upstream MP label in the RRO of the
   RSVP Path message of the protected LSP.  The upstream PLR obtains the
   upstream MP label from the recorded labels in the RRO of the received
   RSVP Path message.</t>

	<t>
   To obtain the upstream MP address, the procedures specified in
   <xref target="RFC4561"/> are used to record upstream MP Node-ID in the RRO of the
   RSVP Path message of the protected LSP.  The upstream PLR obtains the
   upstream MP address from the recorded Node-IDs in the RRO of the
   received RSVP Path message.</t>

	<section title="RRO IPv4/IPv6 Subobject Flags" anchor="section-4.4"><t>
   RRO IPv4/IPv6 subobject flags are defined in <xref target="RFC4090"/>, <xref target="section-4.4"/>
   and are equally applicable to the FRR procedure for the protected
   bidirectional GMPLS LSPs.</t>

	<t>
   The procedures defined in <xref target="RFC4090"/> are used by the downstream PLR to
   signal the IPv4/IPv6 subobject flags upstream in the RRO of the RSVP
   Resv message of the protected LSP.  Similarly, those procedures are
   used by the downstream PLR to signal the IPv4/IPv6 subobject flags
   downstream in the RRO of the RSVP Path message of the protected LSP.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Bidirectional Bypass Tunnel Assignment Coordination" anchor="section-4.5"><t>
   This document defines signaling procedures and a new
   BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject in the RSVP RECORD_ROUTE Object (RRO)
   used to coordinate the bidirectional bypass tunnel assignment
   between the downstream and upstream PLRs.</t>

	<section title="Bidirectional Bypass Tunnel Assignment Signaling Procedure" anchor="section-4.5.1"><t>
   It is desirable to coordinate the bidirectional bypass tunnel
   selected at the downstream and upstream PLRs so that the rerouted
   traffic flows on co-routed paths after FRR.  To achieve this, a new
   RSVP subobject is defined for RRO that identifies a bidirectional
   bypass tunnel that is assigned at a downstream PLR to protect a
   bidirectional LSP.</t>

	<t>
   When the procedures defined in this document are in use, the
   BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject MUST be added by each downstream PLR in
   the RSVP Path RRO message of the GMPLS signaled bidirectional protected LSP to record the downstream bidirectional bypass tunnel
   assignment.  This subobject is sent in the RSVP Path RRO message
   every time the downstream PLR assigns or updates the bypass tunnel
   assignment.  The downstream PLR can assign a bypass tunnel when
   processing the first Path message of the protected LSP as long as it
   has a topological view of the downstream MP and the traversed path
   information in the Explicit Route Object (ERO).  For the protected LSP where the downstream MP
   cannot be determined from the first Path message (e.g., when using
   loose hops in the ERO), the downstream PLR needs to wait for the Resv message
   with RRO in order to assign a bypass tunnel.  However, in both cases,
   the downstream PLR cannot update the data plane until it receives
   Resv messages containing the MP labels.</t>

	<t>
   The upstream PLR (downstream MP) simply reflects the bypass tunnel
   assignment in the reverse direction.  The absence of the
   BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject in Path RRO means that the relevant node
   or interface is not protected by a bidirectional bypass tunnel.</t>

	<t>
   Hence, the upstream PLR need not assign a bypass tunnel in the
   reverse direction.</t>

	<t>
   When the BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject is added in the Path RRO:</t>

	<t><list style="symbols"><t>The IPv4 or IPv6 subobject containing the Node-ID address MUST also be
      added <xref target="RFC4561"/>.  The Node-ID address MUST match the source
      address of the bypass tunnel selected for this protected LSP.</t>

	<t>The BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject MUST be added immediately after
      the Node-ID address.</t>

	<t>The Label subobject MUST also be added <xref target="RFC3209"/>.</t>

	</list>
	</t>

	<t>
   The rules for adding an IPv4 or IPv6 Interface address subobject and
   Unnumbered Interface ID subobject as specified in <xref target="RFC3209"/> and
   <xref target="RFC4090"/> are not modified by the above procedure.  The options
   specified in Section 6.1.3 in <xref target="RFC4990"/> are also applicable as long
   as the above-mentioned rules are followed when using the FRR procedures
   defined in this document.</t>

	<t>
   An upstream PLR (downstream MP) SHOULD check all BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT
   subobjects in the Path RRO to see if the destination address in the
   BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT matches the address of the upstream PLR.  For each
   BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject that matches, the upstream PLR looks for
   a tunnel that has a source address matching the downstream PLR that
   inserted the BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT, as indicated by the Node-ID address
   and the same Tunnel ID as indicated in the BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT.  The
   RRO can contain multiple addresses to identify a node. However, the
   upstream PLR relies on the Node-ID address preceding the
   BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject for identifying the bypass tunnel.  If
   the bypass tunnel is not found, the upstream PLR SHOULD send a Notify
   message <xref target="RFC3473"/> with Error Code "FRR Bypass Assignment Error"
   (value 44) and Sub-code "Bypass Tunnel Not Found" (value 1) to
   the downstream PLR.  Upon receiving this error, the downstream PLR
   SHOULD remove the bypass tunnel assignment and select an alternate
   bypass tunnel if one available.  The RRO containing BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT
   subobject(s) is then simply forwarded downstream in the RSVP Path
   message.</t>

	<t>
   A downstream PLR may add, remove, or change the bypass tunnel assignment
   for a protected LSP resulting in the addition, removal, or modification of
   the BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject in the Path RRO, respectively.  In this
   case, the downstream PLR SHOULD generate a modified Path message and
   forward it downstream.  The downstream MP SHOULD check the RRO in the
   received Path message and update the bypass tunnel assignment in the
   reverse direction accordingly.</t>

	</section>


	<section title="One-to-One Bidirectional Bypass Tunnel Assignment" anchor="section-4.5.2"><t>
   The bidirectional bypass tunnel assignment coordination procedure
   defined in this document can be used for both the facility backup
   described in Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC4090"/> and the one-to-one backup described
   in Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC4090"/>.  As specified in Section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC4090"/>,
   the DETOUR object can be used in the one-to-one backup method to identify
   the detour LSPs.  In the one-to-one backup method, if the bypass tunnel
   is already in use at the upstream PLR, it SHOULD send a Notify
   message <xref target="RFC3473"/> with Error Code "FRR Bypass Assignment Error"
   (value 44) and Sub-code "One-to-One Bypass Already in Use" (value
   2) to the downstream PLR.  Upon receiving this error, the
   downstream PLR SHOULD remove the bypass tunnel assignment and select
   an alternate bypass tunnel if one is available.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Multiple Bidirectional Bypass Tunnel Assignments" anchor="section-4.5.3"><t>
   The upstream PLR may receive multiple bypass tunnel assignments for a
   protected LSP from different downstream PLRs, leading to an asymmetric
   bypass tunnel assignment as shown in the following two examples.</t>

	<t>
   As shown in Examples 1 and 2, for the protected bidirectional
   GMPLS LSP R4-R5-R6, the upstream PLR R6 receives multiple bypass
   tunnel assignments, one from downstream PLR R4 for node protection
   and one from downstream PLR R5 for link protection.  In Example 1, R6
   prefers the link protection bypass tunnel from downstream PLR R5,
   whereas, in Example 2, R6 prefers the node protection bypass tunnel
   from downstream PLR R4.</t>

      Example 2: Node Protection Is Preferred on Downstream MP
]]></artwork>
	</figure>
	<t>

   The asymmetry of bypass tunnel assignments can be avoided by using
   the flags in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object defined in Section 4.3 of
   <xref target="RFC4090"/>.  In particular, the "node protection desired" flag is
   signaled by the head-end node to request node protection bypass
   tunnels.  When this flag is set, both downstream PLR and upstream PLR
   nodes assign node protection bypass tunnels as shown in Example 2.
   When the "node protection desired" flag is not set, the downstream
   PLR nodes may only signal the link protection bypass tunnels avoiding
   the asymmetry of bypass tunnel assignments shown in Example 1.</t>

	<t>
   When multiple bypass tunnel assignments are received, the upstream
   PLR SHOULD send a Notify message <xref target="RFC3473"/> with Error Code "FRR
   Bypass Assignment Error" (value 44) and Sub-code "Bypass
   Assignment Cannot Be Used" (value 0) to the downstream PLR to
   indicate that it cannot use the bypass tunnel assignment in the
   reverse direction.  Upon receiving this error, the downstream PLR MAY
   remove the bypass tunnel assignment and select an alternate bypass
   tunnel if one is available.</t>
	<t>
   If multiple bypass tunnel assignments are present on the upstream PLR
   R6 at the time of a failure, any resulted asymmetry gets corrected
   using the procedure for restoring co-routing after FRR as specified in <xref
   target="section-5.2.2"/>.</t>

	<section title="Fast Reroute for Bidirectional GMPLS LSPs with In-Band Signaling" anchor="section-5"><t>
   When a bidirectional bypass tunnel is used after a link failure,
   the following procedure is followed when using the in-band signaling:</t>

	<t><list style="symbols"><t>The downstream PLR reroutes protected LSP traffic and RSVP Path
      signaling over the bidirectional bypass tunnel using the
      procedures defined in <xref target="RFC4090"/>.  The RSVP Path messages are
      modified as described in Section 6.4.3 of <xref target="RFC4090"/>.</t>

	<t>The upstream PLR reroutes protected LSP traffic upon detecting the
      link failure or upon receiving an RSVP Path message over the
      bidirectional bypass tunnel.</t>

	<t>The upstream PLR also reroutes protected LSP RSVP Resv signaling
      after receiving the modified RSVP Path message over the
      bidirectional bypass tunnel.  The upstream PLR uses the procedure
      defined in Section 7 of <xref target="RFC4090"/> to detect that RSVP Path
      messages have been rerouted over the bypass tunnel by the
      downstream PLR.  The upstream PLR does not modify the RSVP Resv
      message before sending it over the bypass tunnel.</t>

	</list>
	</t>

	<t>
   The above procedure allows both traffic and RSVP signaling to flow on
   symmetric paths in the forward and reverse directions of a protected
   bidirectional GMPLS LSP.  The following sections describe the
   handling for link protection and node protection bypass tunnels.</t>

   The solution introduces two phases for invoking FRR procedures by the

   Consider a link R3-R4 (in <xref target="fig2"/>) on the protected LSP path failing.
   The downstream PLR R3 and upstream PLR R4 independently trigger fast
   reroute procedures to redirect the protected LSP traffic onto
   respective bypass tunnels T2 and T1 in the forward and reverse
   directions.  The downstream PLR R3 also reroutes RSVP Path messages
   over the bypass tunnel T2 using the procedures described in

   refreshes for the protected bidirectional LSP while protected traffic
   continues to flow over bypass tunnels.  As node R4 does not receive
   Path messages over bypass tunnel T1, it does not reroute RSVP Resv
   messages over the reverse bypass tunnel T1.</t>

   The downstream MP R5 that receives the rerouted protected LSP RSVP Path
   message through the bypass tunnel, in addition to the regular MP
   processing defined in <xref target="RFC4090"/>, gets promoted to a Point of Remote
   Repair (PRR) role and performs the following actions to restore co-routing
   signaling and data traffic over the same path in the reverse
   direction:</t>

	<t><list style="symbols"><t>Finds the bypass tunnel in the reverse direction that terminates

      SENDER_TEMPLATE Object of the protected LSP (see <xref target="RFC4090"/>,
      Section 6.1.1).</t>

	<t>If the reverse bypass tunnel is found and the protected LSP traffic is
      not already rerouted over the found bypass tunnel T2, the PRR R5
      activates FRR reroute procedures to direct traffic over the found
      bypass tunnel T2 in the reverse direction.  In addition, the PRR
      R5 also reroutes RSVP Resv over the bypass tunnel T2 in the

   Figure 3 describes the path taken by the traffic and signaling after
   restoring co-routing of data and signaling in the forward and
   reverse paths described above.  Node R4 will stop receiving the Path
   and Resv messages and it will timeout the RSVP soft state. However,
   this will not cause the LSP to be torn down.  RSVP signaling at node
   R2 is not affected by the FRR and restoring co-routing.</t>

	<t>
   If downstream MP R5 receives multiple RSVP Path messages through
   multiple bypass tunnels (e.g., as a result of multiple failures), the
   PRR SHOULD identify a bypass tunnel that terminates on the farthest
   downstream PLR along the protected LSP path (closest to the protected
   bidirectional LSP head-end) and activate the reroute procedures
   mentioned above.</t>

   The downstream MP (upstream PLR) MAY optionally support restoring co-routing
   in the data plane as follows.  If the downstream MP has assigned a
   bidirectional bypass tunnel, as soon as the downstream MP receives
   the protected LSP packets on the bypass tunnel, it MAY switch the
   upstream traffic on to the bypass tunnel.  In order to identify the
   protected LSP packets through the bypass tunnel, Penultimate Hop
   Popping (PHP) of the bypass tunnel MUST be disabled.  The downstream
   MP checks whether the protected LSP signaling is rerouted over the

	<section title="Unidirectional Link Failures" anchor="section-5.3"><t>
   Unidirectional link failures can result in the traffic flowing on
   asymmetric paths in the forward and reverse directions.  In addition,
   unidirectional link failures can cause RSVP soft-state timeout in the
   control plane in some cases.  As an example, if the unidirectional
   link failure is in the upstream direction (from R4 to R3 in Figures <xref
   target="fig1" format="counter"/>
   and <xref target="fig2" format="counter"/>), the downstream PLR (node R3) can stop receiving the Resv
   messages of the protected LSP from the upstream PLR (node R4 in
   Figures <xref target="fig1" format="counter"/> and <xref target="fig2" format="counter"/>) and this can cause RSVP soft-state timeout to occur
   on the downstream PLR (node R3).</t>

	<t>
   A unidirectional link failure in the downstream direction (from R3 to
   R4 in Figures <xref target="fig1" format="counter"/> and <xref
   target="fig2" format="counter"/>), does not cause RSVP soft-state timeout when
   using the FRR procedures defined in this document, since the upstream
   PLR (node R4 in <xref target="fig1"/> and node R5 in <xref target="fig2"/>) triggers the
   procedure to restore co-routing (defined in <xref target="section-5.2.2"/>)
   after receiving RSVP Path messages of the protected LSP over the
   bypass tunnel from the downstream PLR (node R3 in Figures <xref
   target="fig1" format="counter"/> and <xref target="fig2" format="counter"/>).</t>

	<section title="Fast Reroute For Bidirectional GMPLS LSPs with Out-of-Band Signaling" anchor="section-6"><t>
   When using the GMPLS out-of-band signaling <xref target="RFC3473"/>, after a link
   failure event, the RSVP messages are not rerouted over the
   bidirectional bypass tunnel by the downstream and upstream PLRs but
   are instead rerouted over the control channels to the downstream and
   upstream MPs, respectively.</t>

	<t>
   The RSVP soft-state timeout after FRR as described in <xref
   target="section5.2"/> is equally applicable to the GMPLS out-of-band
   signaling as the RSVP signaling refreshes can stop reaching certain
   nodes along the protected LSP path after the downstream and upstream
   PLRs finish rerouting of the signaling messages.  However, unlike
   with the in-band signaling, unidirectional link failures as described
   in <xref target="section-5.3"/> do not result in soft-state timeout
   with GMPLS out-of-band signaling.  Apart from this, the FRR procedure
   described in <xref target="section-5"/> is equally applicable to the

	<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="section-9"><t>
   This document introduces a new BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject for the
   RECORD_ROUTE Object that is carried in an RSVP signaling message.
   Thus, in the event of the interception of a signaling message, more
   information about the LSP's fast reroute protection can be deduced than
   was previously the case.  This is judged to be a very minor security
   risk as this information is already available by other means.  If an MP does not find a matching bypass tunnel with given source and
   destination addresses locally, it ignores the BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT
   subobject.  Due to this, security risks introduced by inserting a
   random address in this subobject is minimal.  The Notify message for
   the "FRR Bypass Assignment Error" defined in this document does not result
   in tear-down of the protected LSP and does not affect service.</t>

	<t>
   Security considerations for RSVP-TE and GMPLS signaling extensions
   are covered in <xref target="RFC3209"/> and <xref target="RFC3473"/>.  Further, general
   considerations for securing RSVP-TE in MPLS-TE and GMPLS networks can
   be found in <xref target="RFC5920"/>.  This document updates the mechanisms defined
   in <xref target="RFC4090"/>, which also discusses related security measures that are
   also applicable to this document.  As specified in <xref target="RFC4090"/>, a PLR
   and its selected merge point trust RSVP messages received from each
   other.  The security considerations pertaining to the original RSVP
   protocol <xref target="RFC2205"/> also remain relevant to the updates in this
