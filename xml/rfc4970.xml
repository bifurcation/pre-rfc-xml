  <abstract>
    <t>It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain 
   to know the capabilities of their neighbors and other routers in the 
   routing domain.  This document proposes extensions to OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 for 
   advertising optional router capabilities.  A new Router Information (RI) 
   Link State Advertisement (LSA) is 
   proposed for this purpose.  In OSPFv2, the RI LSA will be implemented with 
   a new opaque LSA type ID.  In OSPFv3, the RI LSA will be implemented
   with a new LSA type function code. In both protocols, the RI LSA can be 
   advertised at any of the defined flooding scopes (link, area, or
   autonomous system (AS)).

<section title="Introduction">
   <t>It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 <xref target="OSPF"/>
   or OSPFv3 <xref target="OSPFV3"/> 
   routing domain to know the capabilities of their neighbors and other routers 
   in the routing domain.  This can be useful for both the advertisement
   and discovery of OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 capabilities.  Throughout this document,
   OSPF will be used when the specification is applicable to
   both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.  Similarly, OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 will be used
   when the text is protocol specific.</t>
   <t>OSPF uses the options field in LSAs and hello packets to advertise 
   optional router capabilities.  In the case of OSPFv2, all the bits in this 
   field have been allocated, and there is no way to advertise new optional
   capabilities.  This document proposes extensions to OSPF
   to advertise these optional capabilities via opaque LSAs in OSPFv2 
   and new LSAs in OSPFv3.  For existing OSPF capabilities, backward-compatibility issues dictate that this advertisement is used primarily for 
   informational purposes. For future OSPF features, this advertisement
   MAY be used as the sole mechanism for advertisement and discovery.</t>

OSPF routers MAY optionally advertise their optional capabilities
   in a link-scoped, area-scoped, or AS-scoped LSA.
   For existing OSPF capabilities, this advertisement will be used 
   primarily for informational purposes.  Future OSPF features 
   could use the RI LSA as the sole mechanism for advertisement 
   and discovery.  The RI LSA will be originated initially when an OSPF 
   router instance is created and whenever one of the advertised 
   capabilities is configured or changed.</t>

    <t>The Length field defines the length of the value portion in octets
    (thus a TLV with no value portion would have a length of 0).  The
    TLV is padded to 4-octet alignment;  padding is not included in
    the length field (so a 3-octet value would have a length of
    3, but the total size of the TLV would be 8 octets).  Nested
    TLVs are also 32-bit aligned.  For example, a 1-byte value
    would have the length field set to 1, and 3 octets of padding
    would be added to the end of the value portion of the TLV.
    Unrecognized types are ignored.</t>

   The Link State ID (LSID) value for this LSA is 0.

<section title="Flooding Scope of the Router Information LSA">
   <t>The flooding scope for a Router Information LSA is determined
   by the LSA type.  For OSPFv2, type 9 (link-scoped), type 10 (area-scoped), 
   or a type 11 (AS-scoped) opaque LSA may be flooded.  For OSPFv3, the
   S1 and S2 bits in the LSA type determine the flooding scope.
   If AS-wide flooding scope is chosen, the originating router should 
   also advertise area-scoped LSA(s) into any attached Not-So-Stubby
   Area (NSSA) area(s).  
   An OSPF router MAY advertise different capabilities when 
   both NSSA area scoped LSA(s) and an AS-scoped LSA are advertised.  
   This allows functional capabilities to be limited in scope.  
   For example, a router may be an area border router but 
   only support traffic engineering (TE) in a subset of its attached 
   areas.</t>
   <t>The choice of flooding scope is made by the advertising 
   router and is a matter of local policy.  The originating router 
   MAY advertise multiple RI LSAs as long as the flooding scopes 
   differ.  TLV flooding scope rules will be specified on a per-TLV 
   basis and MUST be specified in the accompanying specifications for 
   new Router Information LSA TLVs.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Router Information LSA Opaque Usage and Applicability">
<t>The purpose of the Router Information (RI) LSA is to advertise 
information relating to the aggregate OSPF router.  Normally, this 
should be confined to TLVs with a single value or very few values. 
It is not meant to be a generic container to carry any and
all information.  The intent is to both limit the size of the RI LSA 
to the point where an OSPF router will always be able to contain
the TLVs in a single LSA and to keep the task of determining 
what has changed between LSA instances reasonably simple.  Hence, 
discretion and sound engineering judgment will need to be applied
when deciding whether newly proposed TLV(s) in support of a new 
application are advertised in the RI LSA or warrant the creation 
of an application specific LSA.</t> 
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">                        
   <t>This document describes both a generic mechanism for advertising
      router capabilities and a TLV for advertising informational
      capability bits. The latter TLV is less critical than the
      topology information currently advertised by the base OSPF protocol.
      The security considerations for the generic mechanism are dependent
      on the future application and, as such, should be described as
      additional capabilities are proposed for advertisement.
