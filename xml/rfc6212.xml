        <t> This memo updates the registry of properties
            in Authentication-Results: message header fields to
            allow relaying of the results of a Vouch By Reference
            query.</t>

        <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
                <t> <xref target="AUTHRES"/> defined a new header field
          for electronic mail messages that presents the results of
          a message authentication effort in a machine-readable
          format.  In the interim, a proposal for rudimentary
	  domain-level reputation assessment, called Vouch By Reference,
          <xref target="VBR"/> was published and is now beginning
          to see popular use.  </t>

                <t> This memo thus registers an additional reporting property
          allowing a VBR result to be relayed as an annotation in
          a message header. </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="keywords" title="Keywords">
                <t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
          "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
          "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
          interpreted as described in
          <xref target="KEYWORDS"/>. </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="discussion" title="Discussion">
                <t> Vouch By Reference <xref target="VBR"/> introduced
          a mechanism by which a message receiver can query
          a "vouching" service to determine whether or not
          a trusted third party is willing to state that mail
          from a particular source can be considered
          legitimate.  When this assessment is done at an inbound
          border mail gateway, it would be useful to relay the
          result of that assessment to internal mail entities
          such as filters or user agents. </t>

                <t> Reactions to the information contained in an
          Authentication-Results header field that contains VBR
          (or any) results are not specified here, as they are
          entirely a matter of local policy at the receiver. </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="definition" title="Definition">
                <t> This memo adds to the "Email Authentication Methods"
          registry, created by IANA upon publication of
          <xref target="AUTHRES"/>, the following:

          <list style="symbols">
              <t> The method "vbr"; and </t>
              <t> Associated with that method, the properties
                  (reporting items) "header.md" and "header.mv". </t>
          </list> </t>

                <t> If "header.md" is present, its value MUST be the DNS domain
          name about which a VBR query was made.  If "header.mv" is
          present, its value MUST be the DNS domain name that was
          queried as the potential voucher for the "header.md"
          domain. </t>

                <t> If the VBR query was made based on the content of a
          "VBR-Info" header field present on an incoming message,
          "header.md" is typically taken from the "md" tag of the
          "VBR-Info" header field, and "header.mv" is typically one
          of the values of the "mv" tag in the "VBR-Info" header
          field on that message.  However, <xref target="VBR"/>
          permits a different mechanism for selection of the
          subject domain and/or list of vouchers, ignoring those
          present in any "VBR-Info" header field the message might
          have included.  A server could even conduct a VBR query
          when no "VBR-Info" field was present, based on locally
          configured policy options.  Where such mechanisms are
          applied, the verifying server MAY generate an
          Authentication-Results field to relay the results of
          the VBR query. </t>

                <t> This memo also adds to the "Email Authentication Result
          Names" registry the following result codes and definitions:

          <list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="none:"> No valid VBR-Info header was found
                         in the message, or a domain name

                         determined. </t>

              <t hangText="pass:"> A VBR query was completed, and
                         the vouching service queried

                         the vouching service queried
                         did not give a positive
                         response, or the message contained
                         multiple VBR-Info header fields
                         with different "mc" values
                         (see <xref target="VBR"/>). </t>

              <t hangText="temperror:"> A VBR query was attempted but

                              A later attempt may produce a

                      <postamble> Example 1: Header Field
                      Reporting Results from a VBR Query </postamble>
              </figure>

              <t> Here we see an example of a message
                  that was signed using DomainKeys Identified Mail
                  (DKIM) and that also included
                  a VBR-Info header field.  On receipt, it is found
                  that the "md=" field in the latter and the "d="
                  field in the former matched, and also that the
                  DKIM signature verified, so a VBR query was
                  performed.  The vouching service,
                  voucher.example.org, indicated that the sender can be
                  trusted, so a "pass" result is included in the
                  Authentication-Results field
                  affixed prior to delivery. </t>
