    <section title="Introduction">




      <t>This document establishes an IANA registry for Level of Assurance (LoA)
      Profiles.</t>

      <t><xref target="SAML"></xref>
      provides the following definition of the concept of "level of
      assurance":

  <list>
      <t>Many existing (and potential) SAML federation deployments have adopted
a &ldquo;levels of assurance&rdquo; (or LOA) model for categorizing the wide
variety of authentication methods into a small number of levels, typically
based on some notion of the strength of the authentication. Federation members
(service providers or &ldquo;relying parties&rdquo;) then decide which level of
assurance is required to access specific protected resources, based on some
assessment of &ldquo;value&rdquo; or &ldquo;risk&rdquo;.</t>
  </list>
      </t>

      <t>Another definition of an "assurance level" is given in <xref
      target="RFC4949">RFC 4949</xref>, which also identifies the roots of such
      profiles in the NIST special publication series, in particular <xref
      target="SP63">SP 800-63</xref>. Level of Assurance Profiles are used in
      various protocols, including the Security Assertion Markup Language
      (SAML) version 2.0 and OpenID Connect.</t>

      <t>Several so-called trust frameworks and identity federations now
      exist, some of which define one or more LoAs. The
      purpose of this specification is to create an IANA registry where such
      LoA definitions can be discovered. While the quote above references SAML,
      the notion of a level of assurance has gained widespread acceptance
      and should be treated as a protocol-independent concept. The newly created
      IANA registry attempts to reflect this.</t>

      <t>Although the registry will contain URIs that reference SAML
      Authentication Context Profiles, other protocols may use such URIs to
      identify level of assurance definitions without relying on or
      transmitting their SAML XML definitions. Use of the registry by
      protocols other than SAML is encouraged.</t>

      <t>For instance, OpenID Connect defines the standard claim 'acr' as a
      identifier that may reference a SAML Authentication Context Class even
      though OpenID Connect is not itself based on XML or SAML.</t>

      <t>Protocol designers who want to reference the registry should be aware
      that registered LoAs may depend on assumptions that do not carry over to
      all protocols and that such assumptions may vary among the protocols for
      which the LoAs were originally registered.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Name of Registry">
      <t>The name of the registry shall be "Level of Assurance (LoA) Profile", in
      plural "Level of Assurance (LoA) Profiles".</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Registration Template">
      <t>The following information must be provided with each
      registration:</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="URI:">A URI referencing a Level of Assurance Profile.
          This is the registry key.</t>

          <t hangText="Context Class:">A valid XML schema definition for the
          SAML 2.0 LoA Context Class fulfilling the requirements of <xref
          target="SAML"></xref>.
          The registry key (the URI) is the unique identifier for the Context
          Class.</t>

          <t hangText="Name:">A string uniquely and unambiguously identifying
          the LoA for use in protocols where URIs are not appropriate.</t>

          <t hangText="Informational URL:">A URL containing auxiliary
          information. This URL must minimally reference contact information
          for the administrative authority of the level of assurance
          definition and must use either the http or https scheme.</t>
        </list>Note that it is possible for a single SAML Authentication
      Context Class to contain definitions of multiple URIs. In that case, a
      separate registration is to be used for each URI. Both the name and the
      URI are to uniquely and unambiguously identify the LoA. The name is meant
      to be used in protocols where URIs are not appropriate. In addition the
      requester is expected to provide basic contact information and the name
      of the organization on behalf of which the LoA definition is
      registered.</t>


        <t>The name is defined by the following ABNF (as defined in
        <xref target="RFC5234">RFC 5234</xref>):</t>

<figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
label = ( ALPHA / DIGIT )
name = label 1*( label / "-" / "." / "_" )]]></artwork>
</figure>


        <t>The elements defined by the following ABNF productions
        represent a set of reserved values for the name element and are not to
        be registered:</t>

<figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
reserved = loa / al / num
loa = ( "l" / "L" ) ( "o" / "O" ) ( "a" / "A") *DIGIT
al = ( "a" / "A") ( "l" / "L") *DIGIT
num = *DIGIT]]></artwork>
</figure>

        <t>The reason for excluding these productions is a desire to
        avoid a race to register overly generic LoA Profiles under names like
        "AL1" or "LOA2".</t>


      <section title="Example Registration">
        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Name of requester: J. Random User</t>

            <t>Email address of requester: jrandom@example.com</t>

            <t>Organization of requester: Example Trust Frameworks LLP</t>

      <section title="Note on the Example">
        <t>The example is borrowed (slightly modified) from <xref
        target="SAML"></xref>.
        The example should not be registered.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Registration Policy">
      <t>The registry is to be operated under the "Expert Review" policy from
      <xref target="RFC5226">RFC 5226</xref>, employing a pool of experts. IANA
      will be kindly asked to do rough, randomized load-balancing among the experts
      and also to perform an initial review of each submission to ensure that the name
      and URI are unique within the registry. The review criteria are
      outlined below.</t>

      <t>For registrations that reference multiple LoAs in a consistent set of
      policies -- for instance, when a trust framework defines multiple levels
      of assurance -- the registered LoA name and URIs should be consistently
      named so that they can be identified as belonging to the same set of
      registrations. For instance, fruitLoA1, fruitLoA2, and fruitLoA3 are
      preferred over apple, pear, and banana when these names refer to a single
      set of policies defining three LoAs.</t>

      <section title="Reviewer Expectations">
        <t>The expectation of the IANA LoA Registry is that it will contain
        registrations of bona fide Level of Assurance Profiles while not
        presenting a very high bar for entry.</t>

        <t>Expert reviewers are expected to verify that:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>the registration is consistent and that the provided XML
            fulfills the requirements of <xref
            target="SAML"></xref>.</t>

            <t>the name element is clearly associated with the registered LoA
            Profile and is not a reserved value.</t>

            <t>the URI and name elements are not already registered.</t>

            <t>the Informational URL can be expected to be stable and
            permanent.</t>
          </list>Note that multiple registrations may share a common
        Informational URL.</t>

        <t>The reviewers should exclude registrations where the name does not
        unambiguously identify the LoA definition or where the name is a
        simple variation on one of the reserved names.</t>

        <t>Expert reviewers are expected to allow registrations made in good
        faith that fulfill these requirements.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Registry Semantics">
      <t>The intended use for this registry is to serve as a basis for
      discovery of LoA definitions that might, for instance, be used by
      protocol-specific (e.g., SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect) management tools.</t>

      <t>Note that consumers of the registry, being implementations of
      <xref target="SAML"></xref>, are expected to allow configuration of LoA URIs
      at system deployment time. If multiple sources of LoA URIs are permitted in
      addition to the registry (e.g., manual input), then it is important to avoid
      collisions with URIs found in the registry. </t>

      <t>The presence of an entry in the registry does not imply any semantics
      or quality beyond that which results from the review done by the expert
      reviewer as part of the registration process.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document sets up a registry with IANA making the whole document
      a set of considerations for IANA.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The registry is not a federation or trust framework. Consumers of the
      registry are strongly advised to review the information about an LoA
      before relying on it.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Acknowledgements" title="Acknowledgements">
      <t>RL "Bob" Morgan, Scott Cantor, Lucy Lynch, and John Bradley were
      involved in the initial discussions around this idea and contributed to
      the semantics of the registry. The various versions of the document were
      socialized in the Kantara Federation Interoperability WG and in other
      parts of the identity community.</t>
