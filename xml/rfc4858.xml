    <t>
 	This document describes methodologies that have been
	designed to improve and facilitate IETF document flow
	processing.  It specifies a set of procedures under which a working group
	chair or secretary serves as the primary Document Shepherd for a
	document that has been submitted to the IESG for
	publication. Before this, the Area Director responsible for the working group has traditionally filled the shepherding role.
    </t>

<!-- <t><cref anchor="Q" source="RFC Editor">Could the second half of the abstract be

	A Document Shepherd's responsibilities include: 

        <list style='symbols'>
          <t> Providing the Document Shepherd Write-Up accompanying a document that
	      is forwarded to the IESG when publication is requested.

  <section title="Introduction">
    <t>

	Early in 2004, the IESG undertook several experiments
	aimed at evaluating whether any of the proposed changes
	to the IETF document flow process would yield
	qualitative improvements in document throughput and
	quality.  One such experiment, referred to as the "PROTO process" or "PROTO"
	(because it was created by the "PROcess and TOols" or
	<xref target="PROTO">PROTO</xref> team), is a set of methodologies
	designed to involve working group chairs or secretaries more
	directly in their documents' approval life cycle.  In
	particular, the PROTO team focused on improvements to the part of a
	document's life cycle that occurs after the working
	group and document editor have forwarded it to the IESG for publication.
     </t>
    <t>
	By the end of 2004, the IESG had evaluated the utility of
	the PROTO methodologies based on data obtained through
	several pilot projects that had run throughout the year,
	and subsequently decided to adopt the PROTO process for all documents and working groups. This document describes this process.
    </t>
    <t>
	The methodologies developed and piloted by the PROTO team
	focus on the working group chair or secretary as the primary
	Document Shepherd. The primary objective of this document shepherding process is to improve
	document-processing throughput and document quality by enabling a partnership
	between the Responsible Area Director and the Document Shepherd.
	In particular, this partnership has the explicit goal of enfranchising the
	Document Shepherd while at the same time offloading a
	specific part of the follow-up work that has
	traditionally been responsibility of the Responsible Area Director.
	The Responsible Area Director has tens or many tens of documents to	 		
   follow, while the Document Shepherd has only a few at a time.	 		
   Flowing the responsibility to the working group level can ensure more	 		
   attention and more timely response.
	
    </t>
    <t>
	Consequently, the document shepherding process includes follow-up work during all document-processing stages
	after Working Group Last Call, i.e., during AD Evaluation of a document, during
	IESG Evaluation, and during post-approval processing by IANA and the RFC Editor.
	In these stages, it is the responsibility of the Document Shepherd to track and follow
	up on feedback received on a document from all relevant parties.
     </t>
    <t>
	The Document Shepherd is usually a chair of the working group
	that has produced the document. 
	In consultation with the Responsible Area Director, the chairs may instead decide to appoint the working group
	secretary as the responsible Document Shepherd.

      <t>
        The document shepherding process consists of the following tasks:
    </t>
    <t>

        <list style='symbols'>
          <t> Providing the Document Shepherd Write-Up accompanying a document that
	      is forwarded to the IESG when publication is requested, as described in
	      <xref target="proto.process.writeup"/>.

	      <xref target="proto.process.ad-review"/>.
          </t> 

	  <t> During an IETF Last Call, if performed for the shepherded document, following up on community feedback and review comments.
          </t>  

	  <t> During IESG Evaluation, following up on all IESG feedback ("DISCUSS" and "COMMENT" items)
	     related to the shepherded document, as described in 
	     <xref target="proto.process.discuss"/>.
          </t>  
          
          <t> Following up on IANA and RFC Editor requests 
              as described in <xref target="proto.process.iana"/> and <xref target="proto.process.after.approval"/>.
          </t>
        </list>

   The shepherd must keep the document moving forward, communicating
   about it with parties who review and comment on it.  The shepherd must
   obtain the working group's consensus for any substantive proposed
   changes.  The shepherd is the leader for the document and for the
   working group, and maintains a critical and technical perspective.
   In summary, the Document Shepherd continues to care for a shepherded
   document during its post-WG lifetime just as he or she has done while
   responsible for the document in the working group.
    </t>
    
                <t>
   Before any document shepherding takes place, a single Document
   Shepherd MUST be identified for a document (he or she will be named
   in the Document Shepherd Write-Up).  Frequently, the chairs and the
   Responsible Area Director will decide that the working group will
   adopt the PROTO process for all their future documents.  After that
   decision, the chairs, in consultation with the Responsible Area
   Director, decide on who should act as Document Shepherd for any given
   document.  This is typically and by default one of the chairs of the
   working group.  In consultation with the Responsible Area Director,
   the chairs MAY also decide to appoint the working group secretary as
   Document Shepherd for a given document.  The Document Shepherd SHOULD
   NOT be an editor of the shepherded document.
            </t>
	<t>
   It is intended that the Document Shepherd role be filled by one
   person during the entire shepherding process.  However, situations
   may occur when the Document Shepherd role may be reassigned to
   different persons during the lifetime of a document.  It is up to the
   chairs and Responsible Area Director to identify situations when this
   may become necessary, and then consult to appoint a new Document
   Shepherd.
	</t>
	<t>    
	 It is important to note that the document shepherding process only applies to documents that are the product of
	 a working group. It does not apply to documents that originate elsewhere. Additionally,
	 <xref target="proto.when-not-to"/> discusses other instances in which the document shepherding process does not apply.
    </t>


      <section title="Document Shepherd Write-Up"
      anchor="proto.process.writeup">

        <t>
          When a working group decides that a document is ready for submission to the IESG for publication,
	  it is the task of the Document Shepherd to complete a
	  "Document Shepherd Write-Up" for the document.
        </t>

        <t>
          There are two parts to this task.  First, the
	  Document Shepherd answers questions (1.a) to (1.j) below
	  to give the Responsible Area Director insight into the
	  working group process that applied to this document.  Note
	  that while these questions may appear redundant in some
	  cases, they are written to elicit information that the
	  Responsible Area Director must be aware of (to this end, pointers to relevant
	  entries in the WG archive are helpful).  The goal
	  here is to inform the Responsible Area Director about any issues that may have
	  come up in IETF meetings, on the mailing list, or in
	  private communication that they should be aware of
	  prior to IESG Evaluation of the shepherded document.  Any
	  significant issues mentioned in the questionnaire will
	  probably lead to a follow-up discussion with the Responsible Area Director.
	</t>

<?rfc needLines="3"?>
        <t>
   The second part of the task is to prepare the "Document Announcement
   Write-Up" that is input both to the ballot for the IESG telechat and
   to the eventual IETF-wide announcement message.  Item number (1.k)
   describes the elements of the Document Announcement Write-Up.
</t>
<t>
   Some examples of 
   Document Announcement Write-Ups are included in <xref target="examples"/>,
   and there
   are many more examples with subject lines such as "Protocol Action" and
   "Document Action" in the IETF-announce mailing list archive.
</t>
<t>
   The initial template for the Document Shepherd Write-Up is included below, 
     but changes are expected over time. The latest version of this template is available 
    from the IESG section of the IETF web site.

              Who is the Document Shepherd for

	      the document and, in particular, does he or she 
	      believe this version is ready for forwarding to the IESG for
	      publication?  
            </t>
         
         
            <t>
              Has the document had adequate review both from key
	      WG members and from key non-WG members?  Does the Document Shepherd have any
	      concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews
	      that have been performed?
            </t>
         
            <t>
              Does the Document Shepherd have concerns that the document needs more

	      familiar with AAA, internationalization, or XML?
            </t>
         
         
            <t>
              Does the Document Shepherd have any specific concerns or issues with this
	      document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG
	      should be aware of?  For example, perhaps he or she is
	      uncomfortable with certain parts of the document,
	      or has concerns whether there really is a need for
	      it.  In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues
	      and has indicated
	      that it still wishes to advance the document,
	      detail those concerns here. Has an IPR disclosure related to this document been filed?
	      If so, please include a reference to the disclosure and summarize the WG discussion and conclusion on this issue.
            </t>
         
            <t>
              How solid is the WG consensus behind this document?
	      Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few
	      individuals, with others being silent, or does the
	      WG as a whole understand and agree with it?
            </t>

            <t>
	      Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise
	      indicated extreme discontent?  If so, please
	      summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages
	      to the Responsible Area Director.  (It should be in a 
              separate email because this questionnaire is entered
              into the ID Tracker.)

            </t>
         
            <t>
	Has the Document Shepherd personally verified that the
          document satisfies all ID nits?  (See
          http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html and
          http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/.)  Boilerplate checks are
          not enough; this check needs to be thorough.  Has the document
          met all formal review criteria it needs to, such as the MIB
          Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews?  If the document
          does not already indicate its intended status at the top of
          the first page, please indicate the intended status here.
            </t>
         
         
            <t>
              Has the document split its references into normative and
	      informative?  Are there normative
	      references to documents that are not ready
	      for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear
	      state?  If such normative references
              exist, what is the strategy for their
              completion?  Are there
              normative references that are downward references,
              as described in <xref target='RFC3967' />?
              If so, list these downward references to support
              the Area Director in the Last Call procedure for them <xref target='RFC3967' />.
              
            </t>

	<t>
         Has the Document Shepherd verified that the document's IANA
         Considerations section exists and is consistent with the body of
         the document? If the document specifies protocol extensions, are
         reservations requested in appropriate IANA registries? Are the IANA
         registries clearly identified?
         If the document creates a new registry, does it
         define the proposed initial contents of the registry and an allocation
         procedure for future registrations? Does it suggest 
         a reasonable name for the new registry? See <xref target="RFC2434"/>.
         If the document
          describes an Expert Review process, has the Document Shepherd conferred with
          the Responsible Area Director so that the IESG can appoint the
          needed Expert during IESG Evaluation?
	</t>

<t>
Has the Document Shepherd verified that sections of the document
that are written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules,
MIB definitions, etc., validate correctly in an automated checker?

   the request to publish the document.  The Document Shepherd SHOULD
   also send the entire Document Shepherd Write-Up to the working
   group mailing list.  If the Document Shepherd feels that information which may prove to
   be sensitive, may lead to possible appeals, or is personal needs to be written up, it SHOULD be sent in direct email to the Responsible Area Director, because the Document
   Shepherd Write-Up is published openly in the ID Tracker.
   Question (1.f) of the
   Write-Up covers any material of this nature and specifies this more
   confidential handling.

          </t>
          <t>
          The Document Shepherd Write-Up is entered into the <xref target="IDTRACKER">ID Tracker</xref> as a "Comment".
           The name and email address of the Document
          Shepherd are entered into the ID Tracker, currently as a "Brief Note" (this may change in the future). The email address of the Document Shepherd MUST also be added to the "State or Version Change Notice To" field (typically the email addresses of all working
   group chairs, authors, and the secretary will be added).
          </t>

<?rfc needLines="3"?>
          <t>
   Entering the name and email of the Document Shepherd into the ID
   Tracker is REQUIRED to ensure that he or she will be copied on the
   email exchange between the editors, chairs, the IESG, the IESG
   secretariat, IANA, and the RFC Editor during the review and approval
   process.  There are still manual steps required for these parties to
   ensure that they include the Document Shepherd, but it is hoped that in the
   future, automated tools will ensure that Document Shepherds (and
   others) receive necessary communications.

          <t>

   The contact information for the Document Shepherd is also important

		Evaluation comments, making very certain that all
		comments are understood, so that it is possible
		to follow up on them with the editors and working
		group.  If there is some uncertainty as to what is
		requested, this SHOULD be resolved with the Responsible Area
		Director.

            </t>
            <t>

		The Document Shepherd sends the AD Evaluation comments to
		the editors and to the working group mailing
		list, in order to have a permanent record of the
		comments.  It is RECOMMENDED that the Document Shepherd
		solicit from the editors an estimate on when
		the required changes will be completed and a revised
		document can be expected.
		Working groups that use issue tracking SHOULD
		also record the issues (and eventually their
		resolution) in their issue tracker.
            </t>
            <t>
		During the production of a revised document that addresses the AD Evaluation comments, it is  RECOMMENDED
		that the editors keep a list showing how each
		comment was addressed and what the revised
		text is. It is RECOMMENDED that this list
		be forwarded to the Responsible Area Director
		together with the revised document.   
            </t>
            <t>
		In the event that the editors or working group disagrees
		with a comment raised by the Responsible Area Director or has previously
		considered and dismissed the issue, the
		Document Shepherd MUST resolve the issue with
		the Responsible Area Director before a revised document can be submitted.
            </t>
            <t>
		The Document Shepherd iterates with the
		editors (and working group, if required) until all
		outstanding issues have been resolved and a
		revised document is available.  At this point,
		the Document Shepherd notifies the Responsible Area Director and provides him or her with the revised document, the summary of issues, and the resulting text changes.

            </t>
            <t>
		The Responsible Area Director verifies that the issues he or she
		found during AD Evaluation are resolved in the
		revised version of the document by starting the process described in this section at step (2.a). 
            </t>
            
            <t>
            If the document underwent an IETF Last Call and the AD
           concludes that significant issues were raised during
           the Last Call, then steps (2.b) through (2.h) need to be applied 
  addressing the Last Call issues.  This requires the Responsible
  Area Director to present to the Document Shepherd those Last Call
  issues raised only to the IESG.

      <section title="Document Shepherding during IESG Evaluation" anchor="proto.process.discuss">
        <t>
		During IESG Evaluation of a document, ADs can bring forward two kinds of remarks about a document: DISCUSS items and COMMENT items. A DISCUSS blocks a document's approval process until it has been resolved; a COMMENT does not. 
		This section details the steps that a
		Document Shepherd takes to resolve any DISCUSS and COMMENT items brought forward against a shepherded document during IESG Evaluation.
</t>
<t>		Note that DISCUSS and COMMENT items are occasionally written in a
		manner that makes their intent unclear.
		In these cases, the Document Shepherd SHOULD start a discussion with the ADs who brought the items up
		to clarify their intent, keeping the
		Responsible Area Director informed.
		If this fails to clarify the intent, the Responsible Area Director 
		may need to work towards a clarification inside the IESG.
          <list style="format (3.%c)">
            <t>
                Leading up to the IESG conference
                call, the Document Shepherd may see emails
                about the document from directorate reviewers
                on behalf of one or more ADs and also emailed
                copies of DISCUSS and COMMENT items entered into the ID Tracker.
                The Document Shepherd SHOULD immediately begin
                to work on resolving DISCUSS and COMMENT items with the
                ADs who have raised them, keeping the Responsible Area Director
                copied on the email exchange, so that he or she is able to support 
                the activity during the conference call.  When
                dealing with directorate reviews, the Document
                Shepherd MUST involve the ADs to whom
                these directorates report to ensure that these ADs
                consider the review comments that need resolving.

            </t><t>
		Immediately following the conference call,
		when the document changes state from the
		"IESG Evaluation" state to one of the states
		requiring Document Shepherd action, e.g., "IESG
		Evaluation: Revised ID Needed" or "IESG Evaluation:
		AD Followup", the Document Shepherd will receive email.  
		A state of "AD Followup"
                typically signifies the Responsible Area Director's hope
                that a resolution may be possible through a continued discussion
                or (more usually) through a small set of changes as "Notes to the RFC Editor".

            <vspace blankLines="1" />


		Note that there may be very exceptional cases when
		DISCUSS items are registered after an IESG
		conference call.  In these cases, the AD who has raised the DISCUSS MUST notify the Document Shepherd about it. (The 
                notification facility in the ID Tracker is very convenient for
                this purpose and also for the cases where the
                DISCUSS and COMMENT items are updated after they are partially
                resolved.)
            </t><t>

		The Document Shepherd then queries the ID Tracker to collect the
		remaining DISCUSS and COMMENT items raised against the document.  
		The Document Shepherd analyzes these items and initializes contact with the
		ADs who have placed them.  The Responsible Area
		Director MUST be copied on all correspondence related to active DISCUSS or COMMENT items.
		This does
                not place the Responsible Area Director in the critical path towards a resolution, but
                should keep him or her informed about the state of the discussion.

            The Document Shepherd then coordinates the resolution of DISCUSS and COMMENT
	    items and builds a consistent interpretation of
	    the comments.  This step is similar to much of the process described in
	    <xref target="proto.process.ad-review"/>.

            </t>

	    <t>

		The Document Shepherd then communicates the DISCUSS and COMMENT items
		to the document editors and the working group, alerting them of any
		changes to the document that have accumulated during IESG processing,
		such as "Notes to the RFC Editor".
If any changes will be substantive, the Document
          Shepherd, in consultation with the Responsible Area Director,
          as during other stages, MUST confirm working group consensus or sometimes even IETF consensus.
            </t>

            <t>

		After the editors resolve the DISCUSS and COMMENT items,
		the Document Shepherd reviews the
		resulting new version of the document, which will be a revised document,
		a set of "Notes to the RFC Editor", or both, using his or her technical expertise to ensure
		that all raised DISCUSS and COMMENT issues have been resolved.
	
            <vspace blankLines="1" />

		Note that the Document Shepherd MAY also
		suggest resolutions to DISCUSS and COMMENT items, enter them into
		an issue tracker, or perform other steps to streamline
		the resolution of the evaluation comments.  It is very important to
                resolve the comments in a timely way, while the
                discussion is current for everyone involved.  


            </t>
            <t>

            When the Document Shepherd is satisfied that the revised document
            addresses the evaluation comments, he or she communicates the
	    resolution to the Responsible Area Director and the
	    ADs that had raised the DISCUSS and COMMENT items.

            </t><t>

            Each AD who had raised a DISCUSS checks whether the communicated
            resolution addresses his or her items. If it does, the AD
            will clear the DISCUSS. If it does not, the AD notifies the
	    Document Shepherd and adds information to the ID
	    Tracker explaining why the DISCUSS was not resolved.
	    The Document Shepherd informs the working group
	    accordingly. (COMMENT items need not be checked and cleared, because they do
            not block the document, but ADs are encouraged to do so.)

            <vspace blankLines="1" />

            If a DISCUSS was not resolved
	    to the satisfaction of the AD that has raised it or the
	    Responsible Area Director, two possibilities exist:
	   
            <list style="format   (%c)">
              <t>
                The process returns to step (3.d), or
              </t><t>

	        If no progress can be made on the resolution of
		the DISCUSS with the AD who has raised it, despite
		repeated clarifications and discussions,
		the Responsible Area Director should take over
		continued shepherding of the document. Such a situation
		may be indicative of larger issues that the PROTO process
		was not designed to handle.</t>
              
            </list>

            Once the process above has cleared all DISCUSS items, document shepherding continues with step (3.i).

            </t><t>
The Responsible Area Director moves the document to the
          "Approved - Announcement to be sent" state in the ID Tracker.
          If he or she deems the changes to the revised document
          significant, there may be a new WG Last Call, or possibly a
          new IETF Last Call.  The document goes through a new full IESG
          Evaluation process if there is a new IETF Last Call.            </t>
          </list>

    </section>


      <section title="Shepherding the Document's IANA Actions" anchor="proto.process.iana">
        <t>
   IETF working group documents often include considerations requiring
   actions by the IANA, such as creating a new registry or adding
   information to an existing registry, perhaps after consulting an
   IESG-appointed Expert.
 Sometimes the Document Shepherd must keep track of certain IANA actions 
 to be completed by the IESG, such as ratifying the appointment of 
 a designated Expert called for in the IANA Considerations.  
IANA-related processing
   may also include a specified type of Expert review, such as review of
   proposed MIME media types on the designated ietf-types mailing list.
        </t>
        <t>
   The IANA reviews IETF documents and requests responses at any or all
   of the following times: in response to IETF Last Call, during the
   IESG Evaluation review of the document, and at the time when the IANA
   performs actions in its web-based registry for the document, usually
   but not always after IESG approval of the document.  More details of
   the IANA process and IETF interaction are found in
   <xref target="RFC2434"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
At the time of this publication, RFC 2434 is under revision
<xref target="RFC2434bis"/>, and
the updates are and will be of value to the Document Shepherd.
Note that the Document Shepherd MUST determine (by individual review
and consultation with others) what is the most recent and the most
applicable IANA information and guidance for his or her document,
be it the overall guidance, or external documents in his or her area,
or in other areas.  An example of an external document is <xref target="RFC4020"/>.
        </t>

<?rfc needLines="3"?>
        <t>
   Whenever an IANA request comes, during whatever phase of the shepherding process, the requester
   from IANA MUST ensure that the Document Shepherd and the Responsible
   Area Director both receive the request.  The Document Shepherd is
   responsible for responding as rapidly as possible.  He or she should
   discuss requests that introduce any possible concerns with the
   working group.  The Document Shepherd and the Responsible Area
   Director may decide in consultation that an IANA request leads to a
   change that needs additional review or approval.
        </t>
        <t>
   In general, the Document Shepherd ensures that the IANA process
   completes, checks that the registry is correct and that the IANA
   Matrix (http://www.iana.org/numbers.html) is complete and consistent, and
   troubleshoots when all is not well.  At the end of IANA processing,
   the Document Shepherd should be sure that the RFC Editor has
   acknowledged IANA conclusion, i.e., that the handoff has been made.
        </t>
        <t>
   In summary, the task of shepherding the IANA actions is often overlooked,
   but is as important to coordinate and manage as all the other
   document reviews the Document Shepherd has managed.  As with those,
   the Document Shepherd contributes greatly to quality and timeliness
   of the document by effective and responsive shepherding of the IANA
   requests.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Document Shepherding after IESG Approval" anchor="proto.process.after.approval">
        <t>
   After the IESG Evaluation and resolution described in <xref target="proto.process.discuss"/>,
   the IESG approves the document, and the Responsible Area Director
   uses the ID Tracker to ask for any final changes to the Document
   Announcement Write-Up and for it to be issued.  The Document
   Shepherd may have some edits for the Responsible Area Director, such
   as minor "Notes to the RFC Editor", and this is the time to consult and
   provide them.
        </t>
        <t>
   The IESG approval announcement goes to the general community and to the RFC Editor,
   and now the Document Shepherd (identified in the Announcement
   Write-Up) continues to shepherd the document through its technical
   publication.  The RFC Editor currently makes a number of types of
   requests to the authors, Document Shepherd and Responsible Area
   Director.  The Document Shepherd SHOULD lead in responding to the RFC
   Editor and shepherd the document during the post-approval period to its
   publication.
        </t>
        <t>
     The RFC Editor
   request types include: editorial queries about dangling or missing
   informative and normative citations (good shepherding should try to
   catch these earlier, but they happen); requests for the document source (e.g.,
   XML or nroff); occasional technical comments; and copy-edits for review and
   close scrutiny by the authors (AUTH48).  For the latter, the Document
   Shepherd SHOULD lead in checking that copy-edits have in no case
   affected a consensus wording of the working group that prepared the
   document, and SHOULD bring speed to this checking by multiple coauthors.  The Document Shepherd also consults with the Responsible
   Area Director on reviewing proposed post-approval changes to the
   document by any author.  These may require Area Director approval,
   and they often need to be presented to the working group for consent
   if not a full consensus procedure.
        </t>
        <t>   
     As in other phases of document
   shepherding, the Document Shepherd provides attentiveness and timeliness
   by serving as the informed representative of the document and helping
   its advancement and its integrity.
        </t>
      </section>


    <section title="When Not to Use the Document Shepherding Process" anchor="proto.when-not-to">
      <t>
	As mentioned in <xref target="proto.process"/>, the Document Shepherd SHOULD NOT be an editor of the shepherded document. If this cannot be avoided by making another working group chair or secretary the Document Shepherd, the document shepherding process SHOULD NOT be used. There are several other cases in which the document shepherding process SHOULD NOT be used.  These include:
        <list style='numbers'>
        <t> Cases where the Document Shepherd is the primary
	    author or editor of a large percentage of the
	    documents produced by the working group.
        </t>

<?rfc needLines="5"?>
        <t> Cases where the Responsible Area Director
	    expects communication difficulties with the Document Shepherd
	    (either due to experience, strong views stated by the
	    Document Shepherd, or other issues).
        </t>
        <t> Cases where the working group itself is
	    either very old, losing energy, or winding
	    down (i.e., cases where it would not be
	    productive to initiate new processes or procedures).
        </t>
        </list>

	Finally, note that other cases exist in which using the document shepherding process may not be productive.
	The final determination as to whether or not to
	use the document shepherding process is left to the Responsible
	Area Director. If the document shepherding process is not used, the Responsible Area Director
	acts as Document Shepherd, per the existing procedures of shepherding by Area Directors.

<abstract><t>Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations in different implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In order for IANA to manage a given name space prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned, or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a name space, the IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a name space and provides guidelines to document authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.</t></abstract>

These documents define the RTP Payload format for MIDI (Musical 
Instrument Digital Interface), and additional
guidelines on implementation specifically concerning the timing of
reception and transmission for best performance in different
applications. MIDI is a real-time media, which however is brittle to
losses and errors. Therefore the RTP payload format defines recovery
journals as a way of avoiding persistent audible errors, and discusses
congestion control handling for these journals.

            <vspace blankLines="1" />

The RTP payload for MIDI encodes the broad range of MIDI commands.
The format is suitable for interactive applications 
(such as network musical performance) and content-delivery
(such as file streaming).

  This document specifies the encapsulation of IPv6, IPv4 and ARP 
  packets over Fibre Channel.  This document also specifies the methods
  for forming IPv6 link-local addresses and statelessly autoconfigured 
  IPv6 addresses on Fibre Channel networks, and a mechanism to perform 
  IPv4 address resolution over Fibre Channel networks. This document
  (when published as RFC) obsoletes RFC2625 and RFC3831.

  This document replaces and consolidates two separate RFCs on IPv4 over
  Fibre Channel (RFC 2625) and IPv6 over Fibre Channel (RFC 3831).  Most
  of its technical content is unchanged from those RFCs.  The technical
  changes that have been made are primarily based on implementation
  experience.
