      <abstract>
         <t>Using an underscore for a prefix creates a space for
         constrained interoperation of resource records.  Original
         uses of an underscore character as a domain node name prefix
         were specified without the benefit of an IANA registry.  This
         produced an entirely uncoordinated set of name-creation
         activities, all drawing from the same namespace. A registry
         for these names has now been defined by RFC 8552. However,
         the existing specifications that use underscored naming need
         to be modified in order to be in line with the new
         registry. This document specifies those changes. The changes
         preserve existing software and operational practice, while
         adapting the specifications for those practices to the newer
         underscore registry model.</t>

     <section title="Introduction">



         <t>Original uses of an underscore character as a <xref
         target="RFC1035" >domain node name</xref> prefix, which
         creates a space for constrained interpretation of resource
         records, were specified without the benefit of an IANA
         registry <xref target="IANA-reg"/>. This produced an entirely
         uncoordinated set of name-creation activities, all drawing
         from the same namespace. A registry has now been defined (see
         Section 4 of <xref target="RFC8552"/>); the RFC that defined
         it discusses the background for the use of underscored domain
         names <xref target="RFC8552"/>.</t>

         <t>The basic model for underscored name registration, as specified in
               <xref target="RFC8552"/>, is to have each registry entry be
            unique in terms of the combination of a resource record type and a
            "global" (highest-level) underscored node name; that is, the node name
            beginning with an underscore that is the closest to the DNS
            root.</t>

<t>	   The specifications describing the existing uses of underscored naming do 
            not reflect the existence of this integrated registry. For the new
            reader or the new editor of one of those documents, there is
            currently nothing signaling that the underscored name(s) defined in
            the document are now processed through an IANA registry. This
            document remedies that, by marking such a published document with an
            update that indicates the nature of the change. </t>
         <t>Further, the documents that define the <xref target="RFC2782">SRV</xref> and <xref target="RFC7553">URI</xref> DNS resource
            records provide a meta-template for underscored name assignments,
            partially based on separate registries <xref target="RFC6335"/>. For
            the portion that selects the global (highest-level) underscored
            node name, this perpetuates uncoordinated assignment activities by
            separate technical specifications, out of the same namespace. This
            document remedies that by providing detail for revisions to the SRV
            and URI specifications to bring their use in line with the single,
            integrated "Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names" registry. </t>
         <t>The result of these changes preserves existing software and
            operations practices while adapting the technical specifications to
            the newer underscore registry model.</t>

      <section title="Underscored RRset Use in Specifications">

         <t>The use of underscored node names is specific to each RR TYPE that is
            being scoped. Each name defines a place but does not define the
            rules for what appears underneath that place, either as additional
            underscored naming or as a leaf node with resource records. Details
            for those rules are provided by specifications for individual
            RR TYPEs. The sections below describe the way that existing
            underscored names are used with the RR TYPEs that they name.</t>

            <t>This section provides a generic approach for changes to existing

               node names when scoping the use of a
               TXT RRset. The approach provides the
               information needed for adapting such specifications to the use of
               the IANA <xref target="RFC8552">"Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names" registry</xref>. Hence, the approach is meant both as an

               TXT RRset under one or more
               underscored names, the global node name is expected to be registered
               in the IANA <xref target="RFC8552">"Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names" registry</xref>. An effort has been made to locate
               existing documents that do this, to register the global underscored
               node names, and to list them in the initial set of names added to the

            <t> If a public specification defines use of a TXT RRset and calls
               for the use of an underscored node name, here is a
               template of suggested text for registering the global underscored

The URI owner name is subject to special conventions.

Just like the SRV RR [RFC2782], the URI RR has service information
encoded in its owner name.  In order to encode the service for a
specific owner name, one uses service parameters.  Valid service
parameters are those registered by IANA in the "Service Name and
Transport Protocol Port Number Registry" [RFC6335] or as "Enumservice
---
Registrations [RFC6117].  The Enumservice Registration parameters are
reversed (i.e., subtype(s) before type), prepended with an underscore
(_), and prepended to the owner name in separate labels.  The
underscore is prepended to the service parameters to avoid collisions
with DNS labels that occur in nature, and the order is reversed to
make it possible to do delegations, if needed, to different zones
(and therefore providers of DNS).

For example, suppose we are looking for the URI for a service with
ENUM Service Parameter "A:B:C" for host example.com.  Then we would
query for (QNAME,QTYPE)=("_C._B._A.example.com","URI").

<title>Scoped Interpretation of DNS Resource Records through "Underscored" Naming of Attribute Leaves</title>

<author initials='D' surname='Crocker' fullname='Dave Crocker'>
    <organization />

<date month='March' year='2019' />

<abstract><t>Formally, any DNS resource record may occur under any domain name. However some services use an operational convention for defining specific interpretations of an RRset, by locating the records in a DNS branch, under the parent domain to which the RRset actually applies.  The top of this subordinate branch is defined by a naming convention that uses a reserved node name, which begins with an _underscore.  The underscored naming construct defines a semantic scope for DNS record types that are associated with the parent domain, above the underscored branch.  This specification explores the nature of this DNS usage and defines the "DNS Global Underscore Scoped Entry Registry" with IANA.  The purpose of the Underscore registry is to avoid collisions resulting from the use of the same underscore-based name, for different services.</t></abstract>
