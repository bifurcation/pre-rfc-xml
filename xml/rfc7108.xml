    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in <xref
	target="RFC1034"/> and <xref target="RFC1035"/>. L-Root,
	one of the thirteen root servers, is deployed using <xref
	target="RFC4786">anycast</xref>; its service addresses,
	published in the A and AAAA Resource Record (RR) Sets for
	"L.ROOT-SERVERS.NET", are made available from a substantial
	number of semi-autonomous servers deployed throughout the
	Internet. A list of locations served by L-Root can be found
	at <xref target="ROOT-SERVERS"/>.</t>

      <t>Various techniques have been used to map deployed anycast
        infrastructure externally, i.e., without reference to inside
        knowledge about where and how such infrastructure has been
        deployed. Motivations for performing such measurement
        exercises include operational troubleshooting and infrastructure
        risk assessment. In the specific case of L-Root, the ability
        to measure and map anycast infrastructure using the techniques
        mentioned in this document is provided for reasons of
        operational transparency.</t>

      <t>This document describes all facilities currently provided
        at L-Root to aid node identification.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
      <t>This document contains several examples of commands typed
        at a Unix (or Unix-like) command line to illustrate use of the
        various mechanisms available to identify L-Root nodes. Such
        examples are presented in this document with lines typed by
        the user preceded by the "%" prompt character; a bare "%"
        character indicates the end of the output resulting from the
        command.</t>

      <t>In some cases, the output shown in examples is too long to
	be represented directly in the text. In those cases, a
	backslash character ("\") is used to indicate continuation.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Naming Scheme for L-Root Nodes">
      <t>Individual L-Root nodes have structured hostnames that
        are constructed as follows:

        <list style="empty">
          <t>&lt;IATA Code&gt;&lt;NN&gt;.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG</t>
        </list>

        where

        <list style="symbols">
	  <t>&lt;IATA Code&gt; is chosen from the list of three-character
	    airport codes published by the International Air Transport
	    Association (IATA) in the <xref
	    target="ACD">IATA
	    Airline Coding Directory</xref>; and</t>

          <t>&lt;NN&gt; is a two-digit numeric code used to distinguish
            between two different nodes in the vicinity of the same
            airport.</t>
        </list>

        Where multiple airports exist in the vicinity of a single
        L-Root node, one is arbitrarily chosen.</t>

      <t>More granular location data published for L-Root nodes
	(e.g., see <xref target="useofidentity"/>) is derived from the
	location of the airport, not the actual location of the
	node.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Identification of L-Root Nodes" anchor="identification">
      <t>L-Root service is provided using a single IPv4 address
	(199.7.83.42) and a single IPv6 address (2001:500:3::42).
	Note that it is preferable to refer to the
	service using its DNS name (L.ROOT-SERVERS.NET) rather than
	literal addresses, since addresses can change from time to
	time.</t>

      <t>At the time of writing, there are 273 separate name server
	elements ("nodes") deployed in 143 locations: together, these nodes
	provide L-Root service. A DNS query sent to an L-Root service
	address will be routed towards exactly one of those nodes
        for processing, and the corresponding DNS response will
        be originated from the same node. Queries from different
        clients may be routed to different nodes. Successive
        queries from the same client may also be routed to different
        nodes.</t>

      <t>The following sections provide a summary of all mechanisms
        provided by L-Root to allow a client to identify which L-Root
        node is being used.</t>

      <t>Using <xref target="hostbind">HOSTNAME.BIND/CH/TXT</xref>,
        <xref target="idserver">ID.SERVER/CH/TXT</xref>, or
	<xref target="useofidentity">IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/TXT or
	IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS/IN/A</xref> to identify a node for the purposes of
	reporting a problem is frequently reasonable, but it should
	be acknowledged that there is potential for re-routing
	between successive queries: an observed problem might relate
	to one node, whilst a subsequent query using one of those
	three techniques could be answered by a different node. Use
	of the Name Server Identifier (NSID) option on the precise queries that yield
	problematic responses can obviate this possibility (see
	<xref target="nsid"/>).</t>

      <section title="Use of NSID" anchor="nsid">
        <t>L-Root supports the use of the <xref target="RFC5001">Name
          Server Identifier (NSID) option</xref> to return the identity
          of an L-Root node along with the response to a DNS query.
          The NSID payload of such responses is the fully qualified
          hostname of the responding L-Root node.</t>

	<t>The NSID option allows the identification of a node
	  sending a specific, requested response to the client.
	  This is of particular use if (for example) there is a
	  desire to identify unequivocally what node is responding
	  with a particularly troublesome response; the output of
	  the diagnostic tool "dig" with NSID requested provides the
	  problem response with the node identification, and its
	  output in that case could form the basis of a useful
	  trouble report.</t>

	<t>NSID is specified as an <xref target="RFC6891">EDNS(0)
	  option</xref>.  Clients that do not support EDNS(0) signaling
	  (or depend on other systems that do not support EDNS0)
	  may find this mechanism unavailable.</t>

        <t>The NSID option can be specified using the widely used
          diagnostic tool "dig" using the "+nsid" option, as shown
          below. Note that long lines have been truncated for the
          purposes of this document ("\" at the end of a line
          indicates continuation).</t>

      <section title="Use of IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/TXT and .../IN/A"
        anchor="useofidentity">
	<t>The operator of L-Root has distributed a separate DNS
	  service in parallel with L-Root, operating on precisely
	  the same set of nodes but listening on addresses that
	  are different from the L-Root service addresses. Measurements
	  of this separate service should give results that are
	  representative of L-Root. Further discussion of this
	  service can be found in <xref target="identity"/>.</t>

        <t>The fully qualified DNS name IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG
          (note the use of ORG, not NET) has associated TXT and A
          RR Sets that are unique to the responding node. Clients
          are hence able to issue queries for
          IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/A and
          IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/TXT and use the results both
          to identify individual nodes and to distinguish between
          responses generated by different nodes.</t>

        <t>The TXT record returned in the response to such queries
          is structured as follows:

          <list style="numbers">
            <t>The fully qualified hostname of the node responding
              to the query;</t>

            <t>The city in which the node is located;</t>

            <t>The region in which the node is located, if applicable;</t>

            <t>The economy in which the node is located (in most cases,
              the name of a country); and</t>

            <t>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) region in which the node is located. A list
              of ICANN regions at the time of writing can be found
              at &lt;http://meetings.icann.org/regions&gt;.</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>The A record returned in the response to such queries
          is guaranteed to be unique to the responding node. The A
          RRType was chosen in an effort to make the use of this
          mechanism as widely available to client environments as
	  possible, and the ability to map a hostname to an IPv4
	  address seemed more likely to be widespread than the
	  mapping of a hostname to any other value. It should be
	  noted that the availability of this mechanism to any
	  particular client is orthogonal to the local availability
	  of IPv4 or IPv6 transport.</t>

	<t>In this case, because identity data is published using
	  IN-class resource records, it is not necessary to send
	  queries directly towards L-Root in order to obtain results.
	  Responses can be obtained through recursive servers, the
	  responses in those cases being the identity of L-Root as
	  observed through the recursive server used rather than
	  the "closest" L-Root node to the client. This facilitates
	  some degree of remote troubleshooting, since a query for
	  IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/TXT or IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/A directed
	  a remote recursive resolver can help illustrate which
	  L-Root node is being used by that server (or was used
	  when the cache was populated).</t>

	<t>A related caching effect is that responses to
	  IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/A and
	  IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/TXT may be cached at
	  different times, and may hence persist in a cache for
	  overlapping periods of time. One possible visible effect
	  is that the responses to IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/A and IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/TXT as
	  presented from a cache may appear to be incoherent (i.e.,
	  refer to different nodes) despite queries against of the
	  cache happening (near) simultaneously. Caches may also
	  discard the published Times to Live (TTLs) in responses from the authoritative
	  server and replace them with longer TTLs, as a matter of
	  local policy. Interpretation of responses for these queries
	  from caches should therefore be carried out with these
	  possible effects in mind.</t>

        <t>It has been observed that IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/A
	  queries offer a useful mechanism for troubleshooting DNS
	  problems with non-technical users, since such users can
	  often be walked through the process of looking up an A
	  record (e.g., as a side effect of utilities such as ping)
	  far easier than they can be instructed on how to use
	  DNS-specific tools such as dig.</t>

        <t>The fully qualified DNS name NODES.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG
          (note again the use of ORG, not NET) provides multiple
          TXT RRs, one per node, and represents the effective
          concatenation of all possible responses to the query
          IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/TXT.</t>

        <t>Note that in the example below we have forced dig to

    <section title="Provisioning of IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG"
      anchor="identity">
      <t>Individual L-Root nodes run a dedicated, separate
        authority-only DNS server process that serves the
        IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG zone. The contents of that
        zone are unique to every node; hence, each responding
        node will generate a node-specific response.</t>

     <t>The contents of the IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG zone are
        hence deliberately incoherent, the apparent zone contents
        depending on the node responding to the corresponding
        query.</t>

      <t>The IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG zone is delegated to the
        single name server BEACON.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG, numbered
        on IPv4 and IPv6 addresses that are covered by the same
        routing advertisements that cover the L-Root service
        addresses. Reachability of BEACON.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG
        is hence well-aligned with the reachability of
        L.ROOT-SERVERS.NET; therefore, measurement of the IDENTITY
        service ought to give similar results to measurement of
        the L-Root service.</t>

      <t>It is considered best practice always to delegate a
	DNS zone to more than one name server <xref target="RFC2182"/>;
	however, as described, the IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG zone
	is delegated to just one server. Ordinarily, this would
	present a risk of failure if that single server is not
	available; however, given the purpose of the delegation in
	this case and that the expected mitigation of a failure in
	a single node is the routing of a query to a different node,
	delegation to a single server in this particular use-case
	is effective.</t>

      <t>At the time of writing, the ROOT-SERVERS.ORG zone is not
	signed with DNSSEC. When DNSSEC is deployed in that zone,
	the L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG zone will also be signed. This will
	facilitate secure responses for queries for
	BEACON.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG and NODES.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG.</t>

      <t>Secure responses for IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG are
	unlikely to become available even with the deployment of
	DNSSEC in the parent, since the implementation of the
	IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG service involves widely distributed
	static zone data.  Management of key materials distributed
	to every L-Root node would be impractical to audit, and
	signatures returned in secure responses would be correspondingly
	of low value.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Some operators of anycast services choose not to disclose
	locations (or even numbers) of nodes, citing security
	concerns. The operator of L-Root considers that none of the
	published information described in this document is truly
	secret, since any service element that provides service
	to the Internet can never truly be obscured from
	view.  Given that location information can be found regardless
	of any conscious, deliberate disclosure, and since easy
	access to this information has diagnostic value, the operator
	of L-Root has adopted a policy of operational
	transparency.</t>

      <t>The information presented in this document presents no new
        threat to the Internet.</t>

      <t>The aspects of the L-Root service that were deployed to
	facilitate IN-class mapping were discussed and implemented
	as part of an informal collaboration with Xun Fan, John
	Heidemann, and Ramesh Govidan, whose contributions are
	acknowledged. The motivation to facilitate mapping of L-Root
        as an anycast service using IN-class queries was inspired
        by <xref target="Fan2013"/>.</t>

      <t>Helpful reviews and comments from Gaurab Upadhaya, Hugo
	Salgado, Brian Dixon, Bob Harold, Paul Hoffman, Jakob
	Schlyter, Andrew Sullivan, Bruce Campbell, S. Moonesamy, and Stephane Bortzmeyer
	on earlier versions of this document were very much
	appreciated.</t>
