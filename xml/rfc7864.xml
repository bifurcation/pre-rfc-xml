      <t>
Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) allows a mobile node to connect to the same PMIPv6 domain through different interfaces. This document describes
extensions to the PMIPv6 protocol that are required to support
network-based flow mobility over multiple physical interfaces.
      </t>

      <t>
This document updates RFC 5213. The extensions described in this document
consist of the operations performed by the local mobility anchor and the mobile
access gateway to manage the prefixes assigned to the different interfaces of
the mobile node, as well as how the forwarding policies are handled by the
network to ensure consistent flow mobility management.

    <section anchor="sec:introduction" title="Introduction">

      <t>
Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), specified in <xref target="RFC5213" />, provides
network-based mobility management to hosts connecting to a PMIPv6 domain. PMIPv6
introduces two new functional entities, the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) and the
Mobile Access Gateway (MAG). The MAG is the entity detecting the Mobile Node's
(MN's) attachment and providing IP connectivity. The LMA is the entity assigning
one or more Home Network Prefixes (HNPs) to the MN and is the topological anchor
for all traffic belonging to the MN.
      </t>

      <t>
PMIPv6 allows an MN to connect to the same PMIPv6 domain through
different interfaces. This document specifies protocol extensions to Proxy
Mobile IPv6 between the LMA and MAGs to
enable "flow mobility" and, hence, distribute specific traffic flows on different
physical interfaces. It is assumed that the MN IP-layer interface can
simultaneously and/or sequentially attach to multiple MAGs, possibly over
multiple media. One form to achieve this multiple attachment is described in
<xref target="RFC7847" />, which allows the
MN supporting traffic flows on different physical interfaces, regardless
of the assigned prefixes on those physical interfaces. Another alternative is
to configure the IP stack of the MN to behave according to the Weak ES Model
(commonly referred to as the weak host model) <xref target="RFC1122" />.
      </t>

      <t>
In particular, this document specifies how to enable "flow mobility" in the
PMIPv6 network (i.e., LMAs and MAGs). In order to
do so, two main operations are required: i) proper prefix management by
the PMIPv6 network and  ii) consistent flow forwarding policies. This memo
analyzes different potential use case scenarios, involving different prefix
assignment requirements and, therefore, different PMIPv6 network extensions to
enable "flow mobility".

      <section anchor="sec:use_case_scenarios" title="Use Case Scenarios">

        <t>
In contrast to a typical handover where connectivity to a physical medium is
relinquished and then re-established, flow mobility assumes that an MN can
have simultaneous access to more than one network. In this specification, it is
assumed that the LMA is aware of the MN's
ability to have simultaneous access to both access networks and the ability to
handle the same or a different set of prefixes on each access. How this is done
is outside the scope of this specification.
        </t>

        <t>
There are different flow mobility scenarios. In some of them, the MN
might share a common set of prefixes among all its physical interfaces;
in others, the MN might have a different subset of prefixes configured
on each of the physical interfaces. The different scenarios are the
following:

          <list style="numbers">

            <t>
At the time of a new network attachment, the MN obtains the same prefix or the
same set of prefixes as already assigned to an existing session. This is not the
default behavior with basic PMIPv6 <xref target="RFC5213" />, and the LMA needs
to be able to provide the same assignment even for the simultaneous attachment
(as opposed to the handover scenario only).
            </t>

            <t>
At the time of a new network attachment, the MN obtains a new prefix or a new
set of prefixes for the new session. This is the default behavior with basic
PMIPv6 <xref target="RFC5213" />.
            </t>

          </list>

        </t>

        <t>
A combination of the two above-mentioned scenarios is also possible. At the time
of a new network attachment, the MN obtains a combination of prefix(es) in use
and new prefix(es). This is a hybrid of the two scenarios described before. The
local policy determines whether the new prefix is exclusive to the new
attachment or can be assigned to an existing attachment as well.

        </t>

        <t>
The operational description of how to enable flow mobility in each of these
scenarios is provided in Sections <xref target="sec:basic_operation_shared" format="counter"/> and
<xref target="sec:basic_operation_unique" format="counter"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
The extensions described in this document support all the aforementioned
scenarios.
        </t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="sec:basic_operation" title="Basic Operation">

        <t>
This section describes how the PMIPv6 extensions described in this document
enable flow mobility support.
        </t>

        <t>
Both the MN and the LMA MUST have local policies in
place to ensure that packets are forwarded coherently for unidirectional and
bidirectional communications. The details about how this consistency is ensured
are out of the scope of this document. Either the MN or the LMA can initiate
IP flow mobility. If the MN makes the flow mobility decision, then the LMA
follows that decision and updates its forwarding state accordingly. The network
can also trigger mobility on the MN side via out-of-band mechanisms
(e.g., 3GPP / Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF) sends updated routing policies to the MN). In a given scenario
and MN, the decision on IP flow mobility MUST be taken either by the MN
or the LMA, but it MUST NOT be taken by both.
        </t>

<section anchor="sec:basic_operation_shared" title="MN Sharing a Common Set of Prefixes on All MAGs">

          <t>
This scenario corresponds to the first use case scenario described in
<xref target="sec:use_case_scenarios" />. Extensions to basic PMIPv6  <xref target="RFC5213" /> signaling at the time of a new attachment are needed
to ensure that the same prefix (or set of prefixes) is assigned to all the
interfaces of the same MN that are simultaneously attached.
Subsequently, no further signaling is necessary between the local mobility
anchor and the MAG, and flows are forwarded according to policy
rules on the LMA and the MN.
          </t>

          <t>
If the LMA assigns a common prefix (or set of prefixes) to the
different physical interfaces attached to the domain, then every MAG already has
all the routing knowledge required to forward uplink or downlink packets after
the Proxy Binding Update / Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (PBU/PBA) registration for each MAG, and the LMA does not
need to send any kind of signaling in order to move flows across the different
physical interfaces (because moving flows is a local decision of the LMA).
Optionally, signaling MAY be exchanged in case the MAG needs to know about flow-level information (e.g., to link flows with proper QoS paths and/or inform the
MN <xref target="RFC7222" />).
          </t>

          <t>
The LMA needs to know when to assign the same set of prefixes
to all the different physical interfaces of the MN. This can be
achieved by different means, such as policy configuration, default policies,
etc. In this document, a new Handoff Indicator (HI) ("Attachment over a new
interface sharing prefixes" (6) value) is defined that allows the MAG to indicate to the LMA that the same set of
prefixes MUST be assigned to the MN. The considerations of Section
5.4.1 of <xref target="RFC5213"/> are updated by this specification as follows:

            <list style="symbols">

              <t>
If there is at least one Home Network Prefix Option present in the request with
a NON_ZERO prefix value, there exists a Binding Cache Entry (BCE) (with all HNPs in the BCE matching the prefix values of all
Home Network Prefix Options of the received Proxy Binding Update message), and
the entry matches the MN identifier in the Mobile Node Identifier
Option of the received Proxy Binding Update message, and the value of the
HI of the received Proxy Binding Update is equal to "Attachment
over a new interface sharing prefixes".

                <list style="numbers">

                  <t>
If there is a Mobile Node Link-layer Identifier Option present in the request, and the BCE matches the Access Technology Type (ATT) and the
MN-LL-Identifier, then the request MUST be considered as a request for
updating that BCE.
                  </t>

                  <t>
If there is a Mobile Node Link-layer Identifier Option present in the request, and the BCE does not match the Access Technology Type (ATT) and
the MN-LL-Identifier, then the request MUST be considered as a request for creating a new
mobility session sharing the same set of HNPs assigned to the
existing BCE found.
                  </t>

                  <t>
If there is not a Mobile Node Link-layer Identifier Option present in the request, then the request
MUST be considered as a request for creating a new mobility session sharing the

          <t>
Next, an example of how flow mobility works in this case is shown. In
<xref target="fig:shared_prefix_across_physical_interfaces" />, a mobile
node (MN1) has two different physical interfaces (if1 of access technology
type ATT1, and if2 of access technology type ATT2). Each physical
interface is attached to a different MAG, both of them
controlled by the same LMA. Both physical interfaces are
assigned the same prefix (pref1) upon attachment to the MAGs. If the IP layer
at the MN shows one single logical interface (e.g., as described in
<xref target="RFC7847" />), then the mobile
node has one single IPv6 address configured at the IP layer: pref1::mn1.
Otherwise, per interface IPv6 addresses (e.g., pref1::if1 and pref1::if2) would
be configured; each address MUST be valid on every interface. We assume the
first case in the following example (and in the rest of this document).
Initially, flow X goes through MAG1 and flow Y through MAG2. At a certain point,
flow Y can be moved to also go through MAG1.
<xref target="fig:shared_prefix_signaling" /> shows the scenario in which no
flow-level information needs to be exchanged, so there is no signaling between
the LMA and the MAGs.
          </t>

          <t>
Note that if different IPv6 addresses are configured at the IP layer, IP-session
continuity is still possible (for each of the configured IP addresses). This
is achieved by the network delivering packets destined to a particular IP
address of the MN to the right of MN's physical interface where the flow
is selected to be moved, and the MN also selecting the same interface when
sending traffic back uplink.
          </t>

routing at the LMA MAY be used, as it does not impact the operation of the

<section anchor="sec:basic_operation_unique" title="MN with Different Sets of Prefixes on Each MAG">

          <t>
A different flow mobility scenario happens when the LMA
assigns different sets of prefixes to physical interfaces of the same mobile
node. This covers the second case, or a combination of scenarios, described in
<xref target="sec:use_case_scenarios" />. In this case, additional signaling is
required between the LMA and the MAG to
enable relocating flows between the different attachments, so the MAGs are aware
of the prefixes for which the MN is going to receive traffic, and local routing
entries are configured accordingly. 
          </t>

          <t>
In this case, signaling is required when a flow is to be moved from its original
interface to a new one. Since the LMA cannot send a PBA
message that has not been triggered in response to a received PBU message, the
solution defined in this specification makes use of two mobility messages:
FMI and FMA, which actually use
the format of the Update Notifications for PMIPv6 defined in
<xref target="RFC7077" />. The trigger for the flow movement can be on the
MN (e.g., by using layer-2 signaling with the MAG), or on the network
(e.g., based on congestion and measurements), which then notifies the MN for the
final IP flow mobility decision (as stated in <xref
target="sec:use_case_scenarios" />). Policy management
functions (e.g., 3GPP/ANDSF) can be used for that purpose; however, how the
network notifies the MN is out of the scope of this document.

If the flow is being moved from its default path (which is determined by the
destination prefix) to a different one, the LMA constructs a
FMI message. This message includes a Home Network Prefix Option for each of the prefixes that are requested to be provided with
flow mobility support on the new MAG (note that these prefixes are not anchored
by the target MAG, and therefore the MAG MUST NOT advertise them on the MAG-MN
link), with the off-link bit (L) set to one. This message MUST be sent to the
new target MAG, i.e., the one selected to be used in the
forwarding of the flow. The MAG replies with an FMA. The message sequence is shown in <xref target="fig:upn_trigger" />.

      <section anchor="sec:use_PBU_PBA" title="Use of PBU/PBA Signaling">

        <t>
This specification introduces the FMI/FMA signaling, which allows the LMA to exchange
required information with the MAG to enable flow mobility without waiting to
receive a PBU. However, there are scenarios in which the trigger for flow
mobility might be related to a new MN's interface attachment. In this case, the
PBA sent in response to the PBU received from the new MAG can convey the same
signaling that the FMI does. In this case, the LMA MUST include a Home Network Prefix Option in the PBA for each of the prefixes that are requested to be
provided with flow mobility support on the new MAG with the off-link bit (L) set
to one.
        </t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="sec:flow-level_info" title="Use of Flow-Level Information">

        <t>
This specification does not mandate flow-level information to be exchanged
between the LMA and the MAG to provide flow mobility support. It only requires
that the LMA keeps a flow-level state (<xref target="sec:fmc" />). However, there are
scenarios in which the MAG might need to know which flow(s) is/are coming within
a prefix that has been moved, to link it/them to the proper QoS path(s) and
optionally, inform the MN about it. This section describes the extensions used
to include flow-level information in the signaling defined between the LMA and
the MAG.
        </t>

        <t>
This specification reuses some of the mobility extensions and message formats
defined in <xref target="RFC5648" /> and <xref target="RFC6089" />, namely the
Flow Identification Mobility Option and the Flow Mobility Sub-Options.
        </t>

        <t>
If the LMA wants to convey flow-level information to the MAG, it MUST
include in the FMI (or the PBA) a Flow Identification Mobility Option for all
the flows that the MAG needs to be aware of with flow granularity. Each Flow
Identification Mobility Option MUST include a Traffic Selector Sub-Option including such
flow-level information. 
        </t>

        <t>
To remove a flow-binding state at the MAG, the LMA simply sends an FMI (or a PBA,
if it is in response to a PBU) message that includes flow identification options
for all the flows that need to be refreshed, modified, or added, and simply
omits those that need to be removed.
        </t>

        <t>
Note that even if a common set of prefixes is used, providing the MAG with
flow-level information requires signaling to be exchanged, in this case between
the LMA and the MAG. This is done by sending an FMI message (or a PBA, if it is sent
in response to a PBU).

               title="Multiple Proxy Care-of Address Registration">

        <t>
The binding cache structure of the LMA is extended to allow
multiple proxy care-of address (Proxy-CoA) registrations, and support the mobile
node using the same address (prefix) beyond a single interface and MAG. The LMA maintains multiple BCEs for an MN. The number
of BCEs for an MN is equal to the number of the MN's
interfaces attached to any MAGs.
        </t>

        <t>
This specification reuses the extensions defined in <xref target="RFC5648" />
to manage multiple registrations, but in the context of PMIPv6. The
binding cache is therefore extended to include more than one proxy care-of
address and to associate each of them with a BID. Note
that the BID is a local identifier, assigned and used by the local mobility
anchor to identify which entry of the FMC is used to decide how
to route a given flow.

The BID field contains the identifier of the BCE to which the packets
matching the flow information described in the TS field will be forwarded.
When it is decided that a flow is to be moved, the affected BID(s) of the table are
updated.
        </t>

        <t>
Similar to the flow binding described in <xref target="RFC6089" />, each entry of
the FMC points to a specific BID. When a flow is moved, the LMA simply updates the
pointer of the flow-binding entry with the BID of the interface to which the
flow will be moved. The TS in the flow-binding table is
defined in <xref target="RFC6088" />. TS is used to classify the packets of flows
based on specific parameters such as service type, source, and destination
address, etc. The packets matching with the same TS will be applied the same
forwarding policy. FID-PRI is the order of precedence to take action on the
traffic. The action may be to forward or drop. If a binding entry becomes "Inactive", it
does not affect data traffic. An entry becomes "Inactive" only if all of the
BIDs are de-registered.
        </t>

        <t>
The MAG MAY also maintain a similar data structure. In case no
full flow mobility state is required at the MAG, the Binding Update List (BUL)
data structure is enough: no extra conceptual data entries are needed. If full per-flow state is required at the MAG, it SHOULD
also maintain an FMC structure.
