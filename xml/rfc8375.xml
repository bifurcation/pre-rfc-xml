      <t>
	This document specifies the behavior that is expected from the
	Domain Name System with regard to DNS queries for names ending
	with '.home.arpa.' and designates this domain as a special-use
	domain name. 'home.arpa.' is designated for non-unique use in
	residential home networks.  The Home Networking Control
	Protocol (HNCP) is updated to use the 'home.arpa.' domain
	instead of '.home'.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>
	Users and devices within a home network (hereafter referred to as
	"homenet") require devices and services to be identified by
	names that are unique within the boundaries of the homenet
	<xref target="RFC7368"/>. The naming mechanism needs to
	function without configuration from the user. While it may be
	possible for a name to be delegated by an ISP, homenets must
	also function in the absence of such a delegation.  This
	document reserves the name 'home.arpa.' to serve as the
	default name for this purpose, with a scope limited to each
	individual homenet.
      </t>
      
      <t>
	This document corrects an error in <xref target="RFC7788"/> by replacing '.home' with
	'home.arpa.' as the default domain name for homenets. '.home' was selected as the
	most user-friendly option; however, there are existing uses of '.home' that may be in
	conflict with this use. Evidence indicates that '.home' queries frequently leak out and
	reach the root name servers <xref target="ICANN1"/> <xref target="ICANN2"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
	In addition, for compatibility with DNSSEC (see <xref
	target="security"/>), it's necessary
	that an insecure delegation (see Section 4.3 of <xref target="RFC4035"/>) be present for the
	name.  There is an existing process for allocating names under '.arpa.' <xref
	target="RFC3172"/>.  No such process is available for requesting a similar delegation in
	the root at the request of the IETF, which does not administer that zone.  As a result,
	all unregistered uses of '.home' (that is, all current uses at the time of this
	document's publication), particularly as specified in <xref target="RFC7788"/>, are deprecated.
      </t>

      <t>
	This document registers the domain 'home.arpa.' as a special-use domain name <xref
	target="RFC6761"/> and specifies the behavior that is expected from the Domain Name
	System with regard to DNS queries for names whose rightmost non-terminal labels are
	'home.arpa.'.  Queries for names ending with '.home.arpa.' are of local significance
	within the scope of a homenet, meaning that identical queries will result in different
	results from one homenet to another.  In other words, a name ending in '.home.arpa.' is
	not globally unique.
      </t>

      <t>
	Although this document makes specific reference to <xref target="RFC7788"/>, it is not intended that
	the use of 'home.arpa.' be restricted solely to networks where HNCP is
	deployed. Rather, 'home.arpa.' is intended to be the correct domain for uses like the one described
	for '.home' in <xref target="RFC7788"/>: local name service in residential homenets.

    <section anchor="guidance" title="General Guidance">
      <t>
	The domain name 'home.arpa.' is to be used for naming within residential
	homenets. Names ending with '.home.arpa.' reference a zone that is
	served locally, the contents
	of which are unique only to a particular homenet and are not globally unique.  Such
	names refer to nodes and/or services that are located within a homenet (e.g., a printer
	or a toaster).
      </t>
      <t>
	DNS queries for names ending with '.home.arpa.' are resolved using local resolvers on the
	homenet.  Such queries MUST NOT be recursively forwarded to servers outside the logical
	boundaries of the homenet.
      </t>
      <t>
	Some service discovery user interfaces that are expected to be used on homenets conceal
	information such as domain names from end users.  However, in some cases, it is still expected that users will need to see, remember, and even type names ending with
	'.home.arpa.'.  The Homenet Working Group hopes that this name will in some way indicate to as
many readers as possible that such domain names are referring to
devices in the home, but we recognize that it is an imperfect
solution.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="considerations" title="Domain Name Reservation Considerations">
      <t>
	This section specifies considerations for systems involved in domain name resolution
	when resolving queries for names ending with '.home.arpa.'.  Each item in this section
	addresses some aspect of the DNS or the process of resolving domain names that would be
	affected by this special-use allocation.  Detailed explanations of these items can be
	found in Section 5 of <xref target="RFC6761"/>. Although the term
	'homenet' in <xref target="RFC7788"/> refers to home networks that implement a
	particular set of features, in this document the term is used to mean
	any home network, regardless of the set of features it implements.
	<list style="numbers">
	  <t>
	    Users can use names ending with '.home.arpa.' just as they would use any other domain
	    name. The 'home.arpa.' name is chosen to be readily recognized by users as signifying that
	    the name is addressing a service on the homenet to which the user's device is connected.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    Application software SHOULD NOT treat names ending in '.home.arpa.' differently than
	    other names.  In particular, there is no basis for trusting names that are subdomains
	    of 'home.arpa.' (see <xref target="security"/>).
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    Name resolution APIs and libraries MUST NOT recognize names that end in
	    '.home.arpa.' as special and MUST NOT treat them as having special significance,
	    except that it may be necessary that such APIs not bypass the locally configured
	    recursive resolvers.
	    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
	    One or more IP addresses for recursive DNS servers will usually be supplied to the
	    client through router advertisements or DHCP.  For an administrative domain that
	    uses subdomains of 'home.arpa.', such as a homenet, the recursive resolvers provided by
	    that domain will be able to answer queries for subdomains of 'home.arpa.'; other
	    resolvers will not, or they will provide answers that are not correct within that
	    administrative domain.
	    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
	    A host that is configured to use a resolver other than one that has been provided by
	    the local network may be unable to resolve, or may receive incorrect results for,
	    subdomains of 'home.arpa.'.  In order to avoid this, it is permissible that hosts
	    use the resolvers that are locally provided for resolving 'home.arpa.', even when they are
	    configured to use other resolvers.
	  </t>

	  <t>There are three considerations for recursive resolvers that
	  follow this specification:<list style="letters">

	      <t>
		Recursive resolvers at sites using 'home.arpa.' MUST transparently support
		DNSSEC queries: queries for DNSSEC records and queries with
		the DNSSEC OK (DO) bit set
		(see Section 3.2.1 of <xref target="RFC4035"/>).  While validation is not required, it
		is strongly encouraged: a caching recursive resolver that does not validate
		answers that can be validated may cache invalid data.  This, in turn, will prevent
		validating stub resolvers from successfully validating answers.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Unless configured otherwise, recursive resolvers and DNS proxies MUST behave as
		described in Section 3 of the Locally Served Zones document
		<xref target="RFC6303"/>.  That is,
		queries for 'home.arpa.' and subdomains of 'home.arpa.' MUST NOT be forwarded, with
		one important exception: a query for a DS record with the DO bit set MUST return the
		correct answer for that question, including correct information in the authority
		section that proves that the record is nonexistent.
		<vspace blankLines="1"/>
		So, for example, a query for the NS record for 'home.arpa.' MUST NOT result in that
		query being forwarded to an upstream cache nor to the authoritative DNS server for
		'.arpa.'.  However, as necessary to provide accurate authority information, a query
		for the DS record MUST result in forwarding whatever queries are necessary;
		typically, this will just be a query for the DS record, since the necessary
		authority information will be included in the authority section of the response
		if the DO bit is set.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		In addition to the behavior specified above, recursive resolvers that can be used in
		a homenet MUST be configurable to forward queries for 'home.arpa.' and subdomains of
		'home.arpa.' to an authoritative server for 'home.arpa.'.   This server will provide
		authoritative data for 'home.arpa.' within a particular homenet.   The special
		handling for DS records for the 'home.arpa.' delegation is still required.
		<vspace blankLines="1"/>
		It is permissible to combine the recursive resolver function for general DNS
		lookups with an authoritative resolver for 'home.arpa.'; in this case, rather
		than forwarding queries for subdomains of 'home.arpa.' to an authoritative
		server, the resolver answers them authoritatively.  The behavior with respect to
		forwarding queries specifically for 'home.arpa.' remains the same.
	      </t>
	    </list>
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    No special processing of 'home.arpa.' is required for authoritative DNS server
	    implementations.  It is possible that an authoritative DNS server might attempt
	    to check the authoritative servers for 'home.arpa.' for a delegation beneath that
	    name before answering authoritatively for such a delegated name.  In such a case,
	    because the name always has only local significance, there will be no such delegation
	    in the 'home.arpa.' zone, and so the server would refuse to answer authoritatively
	    for such a zone.  A server that implements this sort of check MUST be configurable
	    so that either it does not do this check for the 'home.arpa.' domain or it ignores
	    the results of the check.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    DNS server operators MAY configure an authoritative server for 'home.arpa.' for use
	    in homenets and other home networks.  The operator for the DNS servers authoritative
	    for 'home.arpa.' in the global DNS will configure any such servers as described in
	    <xref target="delegation"/>.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    'home.arpa.' is a subdomain of the 'arpa' top-level domain, which is operated by IANA
	    under the authority of the Internet Architecture Board according to the rules established
	    in <xref target="RFC3172"/>.  There are no other registrars for '.arpa'.
	  </t>

    <section title="Updates to Home Networking Control Protocol">
      <t>
	The final paragraph in Section 8 of <xref target="RFC7788"/>, the Home Networking Control
	Protocol, is updated as follows:
      </t>
      <t>
	OLD:
	<list style="empty">
	  <t>
	    Names and unqualified zones are used in an HNCP network to provide naming and service

	    an administrator MAY configure the announcement of a Domain-Name TLV (Section 10.6)
	    for the network to use a different one.  In case multiple are announced, the domain of
	    the node with the greatest node identifier takes precedence.

	    protocol <xref target="RFC1035"/>.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <section anchor="localsig" title="Local Significance">
	<t>
	  A DNS record that is returned as a response to a query for a Fully
	  Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that is a subdomain
	  of 'home.arpa.' is expected to have local significance.  It is expected to be returned
	  by a server involved in name resolution for the homenet the device is connected in.
	  However, such a response MUST NOT be considered more trustworthy than a similar
	  response for any other DNS query.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Because 'home.arpa.' is not globally scoped and cannot be secured using DNSSEC based on the
	  root domain's trust anchor, there is no way to tell, using a standard DNS query, in which
	  homenet scope an answer belongs. Consequently, users may experience surprising results
	  with such names when roaming to different homenets.
	</t>
	<t>
	  To prevent this from happening, it could be useful for the resolver on the host to
	  securely differentiate between different homenets and between identical names on
	  different homenets.  However, a mechanism for doing this has not yet been
	  standardized and doing so is out of scope for this document.  It is expected that
	  this will be explored in future work.
	</t>

<t>The advice in <xref target="RFC6303"/>, Section 7, to install
local trust anchors for locally served zones can only work if there is some
way of configuring the trust anchor in the host.  Homenet currently specifies
no mechanism for configuring such trust anchors.  As a result, while this
advice sounds good, it is not practicable.</t>

      	<t>
	  Also, although it might be useful to install a trust anchor for a
	  particular instance of 'home.arpa.', it's reasonable to expect that a host with such a
	  trust anchor might, from time to time, connect to more than one network with its own
	  instance of 'home.arpa.'.  Such a host would be unable to access services on any
	  instance of 'home.arpa.' other than the one for which a trust anchor was configured.
	</t>

	<t>
	  It is, in principle, possible to attach an identifier to an instance of 'home.arpa.' that
	  could be used to identify which trust anchor to rely on for validating names in that
	  particular instance.  However, the security implications of this are complicated, and
	  such a mechanism, as well as a discussion of those implications, is out of scope for
	  this document.
	</t>
      </section>
      
      <section anchor="trustanch" title="Insecure Delegation">
	<t>
	  It is not possible to install a trust anchor (a DS RR) for this zone in the '.arpa'
	  zone.  The reason for this is that in order to do so, it would be necessary to have the
	  key-signing key for the zone (see Section 5 of <xref target="RFC4034"/>).  Since the zone is
	  not globally unique, no one key would work.
	</t>

	<t>
	  An alternative would be to provide an authenticated denial of
	  existence (see Section 3.2 of <xref
	  target="RFC4033"/>).  This would be done simply by not having a delegation
	  from the 'arpa.' zone.  However, this requires the validating resolver to treat
	  'home.arpa.' specially.  If a validating resolver that doesn't treat 'home.arpa.'
	  specially attempts to validate a name in 'home.arpa.', an authenticated denial of
	  existence of 'home' as a subdomain of 'arpa.'  would cause the validation to fail.
	  Therefore, the only delegation that will allow names under 'home.arpa.' to be resolved
	  by all validating resolvers is an insecure delegation, as in Section
	  7 of <xref target="RFC6303"/>.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Consequently, unless a trust anchor for the particular instance of the 'home.arpa.'
	  zone being validated is manually configured on the validating resolver, DNSSEC signing
	  and validation of names within the 'home.arpa.' zone is not possible.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="bypass" title="Bypassing Manually Configured Resolvers">
	<t>
	  In item 3 of <xref target="considerations"/>, an exception is made to the behavior of
	  stub resolvers that allows them to query local resolvers for subdomains of 'home.arpa.'
	  even when they have been manually configured to use other resolvers.   This behavior
	  obviously has security and privacy implications and may not be desirable depending
	  on the context.   It may be better to simply ignore this exception and, when one or
	  more recursive resolvers are configured manually, simply fail to provide correct answers
	  for subdomains of 'home.arpa.'.   At this time, we do not have operational experience
	  that would guide us in making this decision; implementors are encouraged to consider
	  the context in which their software will be deployed when deciding how to resolve this
	  question.
	</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="delegation" title="Delegation of 'home.arpa.'">
      <t>
	In order to be fully functional, there must be a delegation of 'home.arpa.' in the
	'.arpa.' zone <xref target="RFC3172"/>.  This delegation MUST NOT include a DS record
	and MUST point to one or more black hole servers, for example, 'blackhole-1.iana.org.'
	and 'blackhole-2.iana.org.'.  The reason that this delegation must not be signed is that
	not signing the delegation breaks the DNSSEC chain of trust, which prevents a validating
	stub resolver from rejecting names published under 'home.arpa.' on a homenet name
	server.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
	IANA has recorded the domain name 'home.arpa.' in the "Special-Use Domain Names"
	registry <xref target="SUDN"/>.  IANA, with the approval of the IAB, has
	implemented the delegation requested in <xref target="delegation"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
	IANA has created a new subregistry within the "Locally-Served DNS
	Zones" registry <xref target="LSDZ"/>, titled "Transport-Independent Locally-Served DNS
	Zone Registry", with the same format as the other subregistries.  IANA has added an
	entry in this new registry for 'home.arpa.' with the description "Homenet Special-Use
	Domain", listing this document as the reference.   The registration procedure for this
	subregistry should be the same as for the others, currently "IETF Review"
	(see Section 4.8 of <xref target="RFC8126"/>).
