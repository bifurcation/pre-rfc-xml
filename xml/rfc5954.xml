<section title="Introduction" >
<t>
This document corrects the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) production
rule associated with generating IPv6 literals in RFC 3261 <xref target="RFC3261"/>.  It also
clarifies the rule for Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) comparison
when the URIs contain textual representation of IP addresses.</t>

</section>

<section title="Terminology" >
<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>. </t>
</section>

<section title="Problem Statement" anchor="problem">

<section title="Extra Colon in IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address"
         anchor="problem-1">
<t>The ABNF <xref target="RFC5234"/> for generating IPv6 literals in RFC 3261 
<xref target="RFC3261"/> is incorrect.  When generating IPv4-mapped IPv6 
addresses, the production rule may actually generate the following 
construct:</t>

<t>[2001:db8:::192.0.2.1] - Note the extra colon before the IPv4 address.</t>

<t>The correct construct, of course, would only include two colons before the
IPv4 address.</t>

<t><list style="empty">
 <t>Historically, the ABNF pertaining to IPv6 references in RFC 3261 was 
 derived from Appendix B of RFC 2373 <xref target="RFC2373"/>, which 
 was flawed to begin with (see errata for RFC 2373 <xref
target="Errata"/>). RFC 2373 has been subsequently obsoleted by RFC 4291 <xref
target="RFC4291"/>.</t> 
</list></t>

<t>The ABNF for IPv6reference is reproduced from RFC 3261 below:

</t>

  <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
    IPv6reference  =  "[" IPv6address "]"
    IPv6address    =  hexpart [ ":" IPv4address ]
    IPv4address    =  1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT
    hexpart        =  hexseq / hexseq "::" [ hexseq ] / "::" [ hexseq ]
    hexseq         =  hex4 *( ":" hex4)
    hex4           =  1*4HEXDIG
  ]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Note that the ambiguity occurs in the &lt;IPv6address&gt; production rule
where the &lt;IPv4address&gt; non-terminal is prefixed by the ":" token.  
Because the &lt;hexpart&gt; production rule is defined such that two of its 
alternatives already include the "::" token, this may yield to the faulty 
construction of an IPv6-mapped IPv4 address with an extra colon when expanding 
those alternatives.</t>

</section> <!-- problem-1 -->

<section title="Comparing URIs with Textual Representation of IP Addresses"
         anchor="problem-2">

<t>In SIP, URIs are compared for a variety of reasons.  Registrars 
compare URIs when they receive a binding update request, for instance.
Section 19.1.4 of RFC 3261 <xref target="RFC3261"/> provides the rules for
comparing URIs.  Among other rules, it states that:

 <list style="empty">
  <t>For two URIs to be equal, the user, password, host, and port
     components must match.</t>
 </list>

Does the above rule then imply that the following URIs are equal:

 <list style="empty">
  <t>sip:bob@[::ffff:192.0.2.128] = sip:bob@[::ffff:c000:280]?</t>
  <t>sip:bob@[2001:db8::9:1] = sip:bob@[2001:db8::9:01]?</t>
  <t>sip:bob@[0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:129.144.52.38] = 
     sip:bob@[::FFFF:129.144.52.38]?</t>
  </list>
</t>

<t>In all of the above examples, the textual representation of the 
IPv6 address is different, but these addresses are binary equivalents
(implementers are also urged to consult <xref target="ipv6-text"/> of
this document for recommendations on IPv6 address text representations).
Section 19.1.4 of RFC 3261 does not provide any rule for URIs containing 
different textual representations of IPv6 addresses that all correspond 
to the same binary equivalent.

 <list style="empty">
  <t>Note that the same ambiguity occurs for IPv4 addresses, i.e.,
  is 192.0.2.128 = 192.00.02.128?  However, IPv6, with its 
  compressed notation and the need to represent hybrid addresses 
  (like IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses) makes the representation issue 
  more acute.  The resolution discussed in <xref target="resolution-2"/>
  applies to textual representations of both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.</t>

<section title="Resolution" anchor="resolution">

<section title="Resolution for Extra Colon in IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address"
         anchor="resolution-1">

<t>The resolution to this ambiguity is simply to use the correct ABNF
for the &lt;IPv6address&gt; production rule from Appendix A of RFC 3986
<xref target="RFC3986"/>.  For the sake of completeness, it is reproduced
below:</t>

  <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  IPv6address   =                             6( h16 ":" ) ls32
                 /                       "::" 5( h16 ":" ) ls32
                 / [               h16 ] "::" 4( h16 ":" ) ls32
                 / [ *1( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 3( h16 ":" ) ls32
                 / [ *2( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 2( h16 ":" ) ls32
                 / [ *3( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"    h16 ":"   ls32
                 / [ *4( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              ls32
                 / [ *5( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              h16
                 / [ *6( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"

  h16           = 1*4HEXDIG
  ls32          = ( h16 ":" h16 ) / IPv4address
  IPv4address   = dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet
  dec-octet     = DIGIT                 ; 0-9
                 / %x31-39 DIGIT         ; 10-99
                 / "1" 2DIGIT            ; 100-199
                 / "2" %x30-34 DIGIT     ; 200-249
                 / "25" %x30-35          ; 250-255

  ]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Accordingly, this document updates RFC 3261 as follows: the
&lt;IPv6address&gt; and &lt;IPv4address&gt; production rules from RFC 3261
MUST NOT be used and instead, the production rules of the same
name in RFC 3986 (and reproduced above) MUST be used.  This
will render &lt;hexpart&gt;, &lt;hexseq&gt;, and &lt;hex4&gt; production rules
in RFC 3261 obsolete; as such, these three production rules
-- namely, &lt;hexpart&gt;, &lt;hexseq&gt;, and &lt;hex4&gt; -- from RFC 3261
MUST NOT be used.</t>
<t>
The use of the &lt;IPv4address&gt;  production rule from
RFC 3986 no longer allows syntactically valid -- though
semantically invalid -- SIP URIs of the form
"sip:bob@444.555.666.777".

<section title="Clarification for Comparison of URIs with Textual
                Representation of IP Addresses"
         anchor="resolution-2">

<t>The resolution to this ambiguity is a simple clarification 
acknowledging that the textual representation of an IP address varies,
but it is the binary equivalence of the IP address that must be
taken into consideration when comparing two URIs that contain 
varying textual representations of an IP address.</t>

<t>Accordingly, the existing rule from the bulleted list in Section 19.1.4 
of RFC 3261 MUST be modified as follows:
<vspace blankLines="60"/>
</t>

<t>OLD:

 <list style="symbols">
  <t>For two URIs to be equal, the user, password, host, and port
     components must match.</t>
 </list></t>

<t>NEW:

 <list style="symbols">
  <t>For two URIs to be equal, the user, password, host, and port
  components must match.  If the host component contains a
  textual representation of IP addresses, then the representation of 
  those IP addresses may vary.  If so, the host components are considered 
  to match if the different textual representations yield the same
  binary IP address.</t>
 </list></t>

<t>In addition, the text in the following paragraph MUST be added to 
the existing list of examples in Section 19.1.4 of RFC 3261 in order to 
demonstrate the intent of the modified rule:</t>

<t>The following URIs are equivalent because the underlying binary
representation of the IP addresses are the same although their
textual representations vary:

 <list style="empty">
  <t>sip:bob@[::ffff:192.0.2.128] <vspace blankLines="0"/>
  sip:bob@[::ffff:c000:280]</t>

  <t>sip:bob@[2001:db8::9:1] <vspace blankLines="0"/>
  sip:bob@[2001:db8::9:01]</t>

  <t>sip:bob@[0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:129.144.52.38] <vspace blankLines="0"/>
  sip:bob@[::FFFF:129.144.52.38]</t>

<t>Jeroen van Bemmel, Peter Blatherwick, Gonzalo Camarillo, Paul Kyzivat, 
Jonathan Rosenberg, Michael Thomas, and Dale Worley provided invaluable 
discussion points on the SIP WG mailing list on the URI equivalency 
problem.  Alfred Hoenes urged the use of angle brackets (as specified
in Section 2.1 of RFC 5234 <xref target="RFC5234"/>) to denote productions.</t>
