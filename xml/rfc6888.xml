   <abstract>
     <t>This document defines common requirements for Carrier-Grade NATs
       (CGNs). It updates RFC 4787.</t>
   </abstract>

   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>With the shortage of IPv4 addresses, it is expected that more Internet
       Service Providers (ISPs) may want to provide a service where a public
       IPv4 address would be shared by many subscribers.  Each subscriber is
       assigned a private address, and a Network Address Translator (NAT) <xref
         target="RFC2663"/> situated in the ISP's network translates the traffic between
       private and public addresses. When a second IPv4 NAT is located at the
       customer edge, this results in two layers of NAT.</t>

     <t>This service can conceivably be offered alongside others, such as IPv6
       services or regular IPv4 service assigning public addresses to
       subscribers. Some ISPs started offering such a service long before there
       was a shortage of IPv4 addresses, showing that there are driving forces
       other than the shortage of IPv4 addresses. One approach to CGN deployment
       is described in <xref target="RFC6264"/>.</t>

     <t>This document describes behavior that is required of those
       multi-subscriber NATs for interoperability. It is not an IETF endorsement
       of CGNs or a real specification for CGNs; rather, it is just a minimal set of
       requirements that will increase the likelihood of applications working
       across CGNs.</t>

     <t>Because subscribers do not receive unique IPv4 addresses, Carrier-Grade
       NATs introduce substantial limitations in communications between
       subscribers and with the rest of the Internet. In particular, it is
       considerably more involved to establish proxy functionality at the border
       between internal and external realms.  Some applications may require
       substantial enhancements, while some others may not function at all in
       such an environment.  Please see "Issues with IP Address Sharing" <xref
         target="RFC6269"/> for details.</t>

     <t>This document builds upon previous works describing requirements for
       generic NATs <xref target="RFC4787"/><xref target="RFC5382"/><xref
         target="RFC5508"/>. These documents, and their updates if any, still
       apply in this context. What follows are additional requirements, to be
       satisfied on top of previous ones.</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Terminology">

	<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
  "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
    target="RFC2119" />.</t>

  <t>
    Readers are expected to be familiar with "Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for
    Unicast UDP" <xref target="RFC4787" /> and the terms defined there. The
    following additional term is used in this document:


    <list style='hanging'>
      <t hangText="Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN):">A NAT-based <xref
          target="RFC2663"/> logical function used to share the same IPv4
        address among several subscribers. A CGN is not managed by the
        subscribers.
        <list style="empty">
          <t>Note that the term "carrier-grade" has nothing to do with the
            quality of the NAT; that is left to discretion of implementers.
            Rather, it is to be understood as a topological qualifier: the NAT
            is placed in an ISP's network and translates the traffic of
            potentially many subscribers. Subscribers have limited or no control
            over the CGN, whereas they typically have full control over a NAT
            placed on their premises.</t>
          <t>Note also that the CGN described in this document is IPv4-only.
            IPv6 address translation is not considered.</t>
          <t>However, the scenario in which the IPv4-only CGN logical function
            is used may include IPv6 elements. For example, Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) <xref
              target="RFC6333"/> uses an IPv4-only CGN logical function in a
             scenario making use of IPv6 encapsulation. Therefore, this document
            would also apply to the CGN part of DS-Lite.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t><xref target="topology"/> summarizes a common network topology in which a
    CGN operates.</t>

  </figure>

  <t>Another possible topology is one for hotspots, where there is no customer
    premise or customer premises equipment (CPE), but where a CGN serves a bunch
    of customers who don't trust each other; hence, fairness is an issue. One
    important difference with the previous topology is the absence of a second
    layer of NAT. This, however, has no impact on CGN requirements since they
    are driven by fairness and robustness in the service provided to customers,
    which applies in both cases.</t>

<section title="Requirements for CGNs">

	<t>What follows is a list of requirements for CGNs. They are in
    addition to those found in other documents such as <xref target="RFC4787"/>,
    <xref target="RFC5382"/>, and <xref target="RFC5508"/>.</t>

  <t>
    <list style="format REQ-%d:" counter="Requirements">
      <t>If a CGN forwards packets containing a given transport protocol, then
        it MUST fulfill that transport protocol's behavioral requirements.
        Current applicable documents are as follows:
        <list style="letters">
          <t>"NAT Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP" <xref
              target="RFC4787"/></t>
          <t>"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for TCP" <xref target="RFC5382"/></t>
          <t>"NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP" <xref target="RFC5508"/></t>
          <t>"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)" <xref target="RFC5597"/></t>
        </list>
        Any future NAT behavioral requirements documents for IPv4 transport
        protocols will impose additional requirements for CGNs on top of those
        stated here.</t>
    </list>
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Justification:">It is crucial for CGNs to maximize the set of
        applications that can function properly across them.  The IETF has
        documented the best current practices for UDP, TCP, ICMP, and DCCP.</t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    <list style="format REQ-%d:" counter="Requirements">
      <t>A CGN MUST have a default "IP address pooling" behavior of "Paired"
        (as defined in Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC4787"/>).  A CGN MAY provide
        a mechanism for administrators to change this behavior on an application
        protocol basis.
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>When multiple overlapping internal IP address ranges share the same
            external IP address pool (e.g., DS-Lite <xref target="RFC6333"/>),
            the "IP address pooling" behavior applies to mappings between
            external IP addresses and internal subscribers rather than between
            external and internal IP addresses.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </list>
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Justification:">This stronger form of REQ-2 from <xref
          target="RFC4787"/> is justified by the stronger need for not breaking
        applications that depend on the external address remaining constant.</t>
      <t>Note that this requirement applies regardless of the transport
        protocol. In other words, a CGN must use the same external IP address
        mapping for all sessions associated with the same internal IP address,
        be they TCP, UDP, ICMP, something else, or a mix of different
        protocols.</t>
      <t>The justification for allowing other behaviors is to allow the
        administrator to save external addresses and ports for application
        protocols that are known to work fine with other behaviors in practice.
        However, the default behavior MUST be "Paired".</t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    <list style="format REQ-%d:" counter="Requirements">
      <t>The CGN function SHOULD NOT have any limitations on the size or the
        contiguity of the external address pool. In particular, the CGN function
        MUST be configurable with contiguous or non-contiguous external IPv4
        address ranges.</t>
    </list>
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Justification:">Given the increasing rarity of IPv4
        addresses, it is becoming harder for an operator to provide large
        contiguous address pools to CGNs. Additionally, operational flexibility
        may require non-contiguous address pools for reasons such as
        differentiated services, routing management, etc.</t>
      <t>The reason for having SHOULD instead of MUST is to account for
        limitations imposed by available resources as well as constraints
        imposed for security reasons.</t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    <list style="format REQ-%d:" counter="Requirements">
      <t>A CGN MUST support limiting the number of external ports (or,
        equivalently, "identifiers" for ICMP) that are assigned per subscriber.
        <list style="letters">
          <t>Per-subscriber limits MUST be configurable by the CGN
            administrator.</t>
          <t>Per-subscriber limits MAY be configurable independently per
            transport protocol.</t>
          <t>Additionally, it is RECOMMENDED that the CGN include
            administrator-adjustable thresholds to prevent a single subscriber
            from consuming excessive CPU resources from the CGN (e.g., rate-limit
            the subscriber's creation of new mappings).</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </list>
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Justification:">A CGN can be considered a network resource
        that is shared by competing subscribers. Limiting the number of external
        ports assigned to each subscriber mitigates the denial-of-service (DoS) attack that a
        subscriber could launch against other subscribers through the CGN in
        order to get a larger share of the resource. It ensures fairness among
        subscribers. Limiting the rate of allocation mitigates a similar attack
        where the CPU is the resource being targeted instead of port
        numbers. However, this requirement is not a MUST because it is very hard
        to explicitly call out all CPU-consuming events.</t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    <list style="format REQ-%d:" counter="Requirements">
      <t>A CGN SHOULD support limiting the amount of state memory allocated per
        mapping and per subscriber. This may include limiting the number of
        sessions, the number of filters, etc., depending on the NAT
        implementation.
        <list style="letters">
          <t>Limits SHOULD be configurable by the CGN administrator.</t>
          <t>Additionally, it SHOULD be possible to limit the rate at which
            memory-consuming state elements are allocated.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </list>
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Justification:">A NAT needs to keep track of TCP sessions
        associated with each mapping. This state consumes resources for which, in
        the case of a CGN, subscribers may compete. It is necessary to ensure
        that each subscriber has access to a fair share of the CGN's resources.
        Limiting the rate of allocation is intended to prevent CPU
        resource exhaustion. Item "B" is at the SHOULD level to account for the
        fact that means other than rate limiting may be used to attain the same
        goal.</t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    <list style="format REQ-%d:" counter="Requirements">
      <t>It MUST be possible to administratively turn off translation for
        specific destination addresses and/or ports.</t>
    </list>
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Justification:">It is common for a CGN administrator to
        provide access for subscribers to servers installed in the ISP's
        network in the external realm. When such a server is able to reach the
        internal realm via normal routing (which is entirely controlled by the
        ISP), translation is unneeded. In that case, the CGN may forward packets
        without modification, thus acting like a plain router.  This may
        represent an important efficiency gain.</t>

    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Justification:">This is a slightly different form of REQ-8
        from <xref target="RFC5508"/>. Code 1 is preferred to code 13 because it
        is listed as a "soft error" in <xref target="RFC1122"/>, which is
        important because we don't want TCP stacks to abort the connection
        attempt in this case. See <xref target="RFC5461"/> for details on TCP's
        reaction to soft errors.</t>
      <t>Sending ICMP errors and SNMP traps may be rate-limited for security
        reasons, which is why requirements B and C are SHOULDs, not MUSTs.</t>
      <t>Applications generally handle connection establishment failure better
        than established connection failure. This is why dropping the packet
        initiating the new connection is preferred over deleting existing
        mappings. See also the rationale in Section 6 of <xref target="RFC5508"/>.</t>

</section>

<section title="Logging">
  <t>It may be necessary for CGN administrators to be able to identify a
    subscriber based on external IPv4 address, port, and timestamp in order to
    deal with abuse. When multiple subscribers share a single external address,
    the source address and port that are visible at the destination host have
    been translated from the ones originated by the subscriber.</t>

  <t>In order to be able to do this, the CGN would need to log the following
    information for each mapping created (this list is for informational
    purposes only and does not constitute a requirement):
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>transport protocol</t>
      <t>subscriber identifier (e.g., internal source address or tunnel endpoint
        identifier)</t>
      <t>external source address</t>
      <t>external source port</t>
      <t>timestamp</t>
    </list>
  </t>
  <t>By "subscriber identifier" we mean information that uniquely identifies a
    subscriber. For example, in a traditional NAT scenario, the internal source
    address would be sufficient. In the case of DS-Lite, many subscribers share
    the same internal address and the subscriber identifier is the tunnel
    endpoint identifier (i.e., the B4's IPv6 address).</t>
  <t>A disadvantage of logging mappings is that CGNs under heavy usage may
    produce large amounts of logs, which may require large storage volume.</t>

  <t>
    <list style="format REQ-%d:" counter="Requirements">
      <t>A CGN SHOULD NOT log destination addresses or ports unless required to
        do so for administrative reasons.</t>
    </list>
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Justification:">Destination logging at the CGN creates
        privacy issues. Furthermore, readers should be aware of logging
        recommendations for Internet-facing servers <xref target="RFC6302"/>.
        With compliant servers, the destination address and port do not need to
        be logged by the CGN. This can help reduce the amount of logging.</t>
      <t>This requirement is at the SHOULD level to account for the fact that
        there may be other reasons for logging destination addresses or
        ports. One such reason might be that the remote server is not following
        <xref target="RFC6302"/>.</t>
    </list>
  </t>
</section>

<section title="Port Allocation Scheme">

  <t>A CGN's port allocation scheme is subject to three competing
    requirements:</t>

  <t>
    <list style="format REQ-%d:" counter="Requirements">
      <t>A CGN's port allocation scheme SHOULD maximize port utilization.</t>
    </list>
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Justification:">External ports are one of the resources being
        shared by a CGN. Efficient management of that resource directly impacts
        the quality of a subscriber's Internet connection.</t>
      <t>Some schemes are very efficient in their port utilization.  In that
        sense, they have good scaling properties (nothing is wasted).  Others
        will systematically waste ports.</t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    <list style="format REQ-%d:" counter="Requirements">
      <t>A CGN's port allocation scheme SHOULD minimize log volume.</t>
    </list>
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Justification:">Huge log volumes can be problematic to CGN
        operators.</t>
      <t>Some schemes create one log entry per mapping. Others allow multiple
        mappings to generate a single log entry, which sometimes can be
        expressed very compactly. With some schemes, the logging frequency can
        approach that of DHCP servers.</t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    <list style="format REQ-%d:" counter="Requirements">
      <t>A CGN's port allocation scheme SHOULD make it hard for attackers to
        guess port numbers.</t>
    </list>
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Justification:">Easily guessed port numbers put subscribers
        at risk of the attacks described in <xref target="RFC6056"/>.</t>
      <t>Some schemes provide very good security in that ports numbers are not
        easily guessed. Others provide poor security to subscribers.</t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>A CGN implementation's choice of port allocation scheme optimizes to
    satisfy one requirement at the expense of another. Therefore, these are soft
    requirements (SHOULD as opposed to MUST).</t>

</section>

<section title="Deployment Considerations">
  <t>Several issues are encountered when CGNs are used <xref
      target="RFC6269"/>. There is current
    work in the IETF toward alleviating some of these issues. For example, see
    <xref target="NAT-REVEAL"/>.</t>
</section>
	
   <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
     <t>If a malicious subscriber can spoof another subscriber's CPE, it may
       cause a DoS to that subscriber by creating mappings up to the allowed
       limit. An ISP can prevent this with ingress filtering, as described in
       <xref target="RFC2827"/>.</t>
     <t>This document recommends endpoint-independent filtering (EIF) as the
       default filtering behavior for CGNs. EIF has security considerations
       that are discussed in <xref target="RFC4787"/>.</t>
     <t>NATs sometimes perform fragment reassembly. CGNs would do so at
       presumably high data rates. Therefore, the reader should be familiar with
       the potential security issues described in <xref target="RFC4963"/>.</t>

<abstract><t>NAT444 is an IPv4 extension technology being considered by Service Providers to continue offering IPv4 service to customers while transitioning to IPv6.  This technology adds an extra Carrier-Grade NAT ("CGN") in the Service Provider network, often resulting in two NATs.  CableLabs, Time Warner Cable, and Rogers Communications independently tested the impacts of NAT444 on many popular Internet services using a variety of test scenarios, network topologies, and vendor equipment.  This document identifies areas where adding a second layer of NAT disrupts the communication channel for common Internet applications.
