      <section title="Applicability">
        <t>The point-to-multipoint connectivity provided by an MPLS-TP
        network is based on the point-to-multipoint connectivity
        provided by MPLS networks. Traffic Engineered P2MP LSP support
        is discussed in <xref target="RFC4875"></xref> and <xref
        target="RFC5332"></xref>, and P2MP PW support is being
        developed based on <xref
        target="P2MP-PW-REQS"></xref> and <xref
        target="VPMS-FRMWK-REQS"></xref>. MPLS-TP
        point-to-multipoint connectivity is analogous to that provided
        by traditional transport technologies such as Optical
        Transport Network point-to-multipoint <xref
        target="G.798"></xref> and drop-and-continue <xref
        target="G.780"></xref>, and thus supports the same class of
        traditional applications, e.g., video distribution.</t>

        <t>The scope of this document is limited to
        point-to-multipoint functions and it does not discuss
        multipoint-to-multipoint support.</t>

      <t>The following subsection summarises the encapsulation and forwarding

      encapsulation options for delivery of traffic to and from MPLS-TP
      CE devices when the network is providing a packet transport
      service.</t>

      <section title="MPLS-TP Encapsulation and Forwarding">
        <t>Packet encapsulation and forwarding for MPLS-TP point-to-multipoint
        LSPs is identical to that for MPLS-TE point-to-multipoint LSPs.
        MPLS-TE point-to-multipoint LSPs were introduced in <xref
        target="RFC4875"></xref> and the related data-plane behaviour was
        further clarified in <xref target="RFC5332"></xref>. MPLS-TP allows
        for both upstream-assigned and downstream-assigned labels for use with
        point-to-multipoint LSPs.</t>

        <t>Packet encapsulation and forwarding for point-to-multipoint
        PWs has been discussed within the PWE3 Working Group <xref
        target="P2MP-PW-ENCAPS"></xref>, but such
        definition is for further study.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="oam"
             title="Operations, Administration and Maintenance">
      <t>The requirements for MPLS-TP OAM are specified in <xref
      target="RFC5860"></xref>. The overall OAM architecture for
      MPLS-TP is defined in <xref target="RFC6371"></xref>, and P2MP
      OAM design considerations are described in Section 3.7 of that
      RFC.</t>

      <t>All the traffic sent over a P2MP transport path, including
      OAM packets generated by a MEP, is sent (multicast) from the
      root towards all the leaves, and thus may be processed by all
      the MIPs and MEPs associated with a P2MP MEG. If an OAM packet
      is to be processed by only a specific leaf, it requires
      information to indicate to all other leaves that the packet must
      be discarded. To address a packet to an intermediate node in the
      tree, Time-to-Live-based addressing is used to set the radius and
      additional information in the OAM payload is used to identify
      the specific destination. It is worth noting that a MIP and MEP
      may be instantiated on a single node when it is both a branch
      and leaf node.</t>

      <t>P2MP paths are unidirectional; therefore, any return path to
      an originating MEP for on-demand transactions will be
      out of band. Out-of-band return paths are discussed in Section
      3.8 of <xref target="RFC5921"></xref>.</t>

      <t>A more detailed discussion of P2MP OAM considerations can be
      found in <xref target="MPLS-TP-P2MP-OAM"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="cp" title="Control Plane">
      <t>The framework for the MPLS-TP control plane is provided in <xref
      target="RFC6373"></xref>. This document reviews MPLS-TP control-plane
      requirements as well as provides details on how the MPLS-TP control
      plane satisfies these requirements. Most of the requirements identified
      in <xref target="RFC6373"> </xref> apply equally to P2P and P2MP
      transport paths. The key P2MP-specific control-plane requirements are:
        <list style="symbols">
	    <t>requirement 6 (P2MP transport paths),</t>
	    <t>requirement 34 (use P2P sub-layers),</t>
	    <t>requirement 49 (common recovery solutions for P2P and P2MP),</t>
	    <t>requirement 59 (1+1 protection),</t>
	    <t>requirement 62 (1:n protection), and</t>
	    <t>requirement 65 (1:n shared mesh recovery).</t>
	  </list>
     </t>

      <t><xref target="RFC6373"></xref> defines the control-plane
      approach used to support MPLS-TP transport paths. It identifies
      GMPLS as the control plane for MPLS-TP LSPs and tLDP as the control
      plane for PWs. MPLS-TP allows that either, or
      both, LSPs and PWs to be provisioned statically or via a control
      plane. Paraphrasing from <xref target="RFC6373"></xref>:
<list>
      <t>The PW and LSP control planes, collectively, must satisfy the MPLS-TP
      control-plane requirements. As with P2P services, when P2MP client
      services are provided directly via LSPs, all requirements must be
      satisfied by the LSP control plane. When client services are provided
      via PWs, the PW and LSP control planes can operate in combination, and
      some functions may be satisfied via the PW control plane while others
      are provided to PWs by the LSP control plane. This is particularly
      noteworthy for P2MP recovery.</t>
</list>
</t>
      <section title="P2MP LSP Control Plane">
        <t>The MPLS-TP control plane for P2MP LSPs uses
        GMPLS and is based on RSVP-TE for P2MP LSPs as
        defined in <xref target="RFC4875"></xref>. A detailed listing
        of how GMPLS satisfies MPLS-TP control-plane requirements is
        provided in <xref target="RFC6373"></xref>.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC6373"></xref> notes that recovery
        techniques for traffic engineered P2MP LSPs are not formally
        defined, and that such a definition is needed. A formal
        definition will be based on existing RFCs and may not require
        any new protocol mechanisms but, nonetheless, should be
        documented. GMPLS recovery is defined in <xref
        target="RFC4872"></xref> and <xref
        target="RFC4873"></xref>. Protection of P2MP LSPs is also
        discussed in <xref target="RFC6372"></xref> Section 4.7.3.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="P2MP PW Control Plane">
        <t>The MPLS-TP control plane for P2MP PWs
        should be based on the LDP control protocol used for
        point-to-point PWs <xref target="RFC4447"></xref>, with
        updates as required for P2MP applications. A detailed
        specification of the control plane for P2MP PWs is for
        further study.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="survive" title="Survivability">
      <t>The overall survivability architecture for MPLS-TP is defined
      in <xref target="RFC6372"></xref>, and Section 4.7.3 of that RFC in
      particular describes the application of linear protection to
      unidirectional P2MP entities using 1+1 and 1:1 protection
      architecture. For 1+1, the approach is for the root of the P2MP
      tree to bridge the user traffic to both the working and
      protection entities. Each sink/leaf MPLS-TP node selects the
      traffic from one entity according to some predetermined
      criteria. For 1:1, the source/root MPLS-TP node needs to
      identify the existence of a fault condition impacting delivery
      to any of the leaves.  Fault notification happens from the node
      identifying the fault to the root node via an out-of-band path.
      The root then selects the protection transport path for traffic
      transfer. More sophisticated survivability approaches such as
      partial tree protection and 1:n protection are for further
      study.</t>

      <t>The IETF has no experience with P2MP PW survivability as yet;
      therefore, it is proposed that the P2MP PW survivability will initially
      rely on the LSP survivability. Further work is needed on this subject,
      particularly if a requirement emerges to provide survivability for P2MP
      PWs in an MPLS-TP context.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="nm" title="Network Management">
      <t>An overview of network management considerations for MPLS-TP
      can be found in Section 3.14 of <xref target="RFC5921"></xref>. The provided 
      description applies equally to P2MP transport paths.</t>

      <t>The network management architecture and requirements for
      MPLS-TP are specified in <xref target="RFC5951"></xref>. They
      derive from the generic specifications described in ITU-T
      G.7710/Y.1701 <xref target="G.7710"></xref> for transport
      technologies. They also incorporate the OAM requirements for
      MPLS networks <xref target="RFC4377"></xref> and MPLS-TP
      networks <xref target="RFC5860"></xref> and expand on those
      requirements to cover the modifications necessary for fault,
      configuration, performance, and security in a transport network.
      <xref target="RFC5951"></xref> covers all MPLS-TP connection
      types, including P2MP.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC6639"></xref> provides the MIB-based
      architecture for MPLS-TP.  It reviews the interrelationships
      between different MIB modules that are not MPLS-TP specific
      and that can be
      leveraged for MPLS-TP network management, and identifies areas
      where additional MIB modules are required. While the document
      does not consider P2MP transport paths, it does provide a
      foundation for an analysis of areas where MIB-module
      modification and addition may be needed to fully support P2MP
      transport paths. There has also been work in the MPLS working
      group on a P2MP specific MIB, <xref
      target="MPLS-TE-P2MP-MIB"></xref>.

    <section title="Security Considerations">

<abstract><t>This document provides a framework and service level requirements for Virtual Private Multicast Service (VPMS).  VPMS is defined as a Layer 2 VPN service that provides point-to-multipoint connectivity for a variety of Layer 2 link layers across an IP or MPLS-enabled PSN. This document outlines architectural service models of VPMS and states generic and high level requirements.  This is intended to aid in developing protocols and mechanisms to support VPMS.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it describes managed objects for point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) based traffic engineering (TE).  The MIB module defined in this document is applicable to P2MP MPLS-TE by extensions to the MPLS-TE MIB module defined in RFC 3812. It is equally applicable to P2MP Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) in association with the GMPLS TE MIB module defined in RFC 4802.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>This document presents a set of requirements and a framework for providing a Point-to-Multipoint Pseudowire (PW) over MPLS PSNs.  The requirements identified in this document are related to architecture, signaling and maintenance aspects of Point-to-Multipoint PW operation.  They are proposed as guidelines for the standardization of such mechanisms.  Among other potential applications, Point-to- Multipoint PWs can be used to optimize the support of multicast layer 2 services (Virtual Private LAN Service and Virtual Private Multicast Service) as defined in the Layer 2 Virtual Private Network Working Group.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>A Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Pseudowire (PW) is a mechanism that emulates the essential attributes of a P2MP Telecommunications service such as P2MP ATM over a Packet Switched Network (PSN).  This document describes the encapsulation and data plane procedures for a P2MP PW. These procedures are meant to be independent of the control plane used to signal a P2MP PW.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is being standardized to enable carrier-grade packet transport.  This document discusses and specifies the P2MP framework primarily related to OAM and related management in MPLS-TP networks. This document mainly refers to RFC5654 and RFC6371. The main focus is on the details that are not covered or not clarified in relevant RFCs such as RFC5654, RFC5860, RFC5921, RFC5951, RFC6371, and draft-mpls- tp-p2mp-framework.  Note: This I-D was made and updated including the discussions in ITU-T SG15, which were described in Liaison Statements such as (https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1235/)  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.</t></abstract>
