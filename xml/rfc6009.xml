This document describes the "envelope-dsn", "redirect-dsn",
"envelope-deliverby",
and "redirect-deliverby" extensions to the Sieve email filtering language.
The "envelope-dsn" and "envelope-deliverby" extensions provide access to
additional envelope information provided by the delivery status notification
(DSN) and Deliver-By SMTP extensions, respectively.  The "redirect-dsn" and
"redirect-deliverby" extensions extend Sieve's redirect action to provide
control over delivery status notification and Deliver-By parameters,
respectively.

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>
Sieve <xref target='RFC5228' /> is a language for filtering email
messages at or around the time of final delivery.  It is designed to be
implementable on either a mail client or mail server.  It is suitable for
running on a mail server where users may not be allowed to execute arbitrary
programs, such as on black box Internet Message Access Protocol
<xref target="RFC3501" /> servers, as it has no user-controlled loops or the
ability to run external programs.
</t>

<t>
The base Sieve specification defines the envelope extension and test to access
information in the message envelope.  Only information available in regular
SMTP <xref target="RFC5321"/> is provided; additional information added to the
SMTP envelope by SMTP extensions cannot be accessed.
</t>

<t>
The "envelope-dsn" extension extends the envelope
test to allow access to the additional envelope fields defined by the
SMTP extension for delivery status notifications (DSNs) specified in
<xref target="RFC3461">RFC&nbsp;3461</xref>.  The "envelope-deliverby"
extension
extends the envelope test to allow access to the additional envelope fields
defined by the Deliver-By SMTP extension defined in <xref target="RFC2852"/>.
</t>

<t>
The base Sieve specification also defines the redirect action, which
sends the message to a different address.  Redirect only allows
specification of the new recipient address.  The "redirect-dsn" extension
extends
redirect to allow specification of some fields defined by the delivery status
notification SMTP extension.  "redirect-deliverby" in turn provides the
ability to set a time limit for delivery as specified in
<xref target="RFC2852">RFC 2852</xref>.
</t>

<section title="Capability Identifiers">

<t>
The capability strings associated with the extensions defined in this
document are "envelope-dsn", "redirect-dsn", "envelope-deliverby", and
"redirect-deliverby".
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="envelope-dsn" title="Envelope-dsn Extension">

<t>
The "envelope-dsn" extension does not define any new tests or actions; rather,
it adds four values to the list of possible (case-insensitive) envelope-part
strings defined in Section 5.4 of <xref target='RFC5228' />:
</t>

<t>
<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="notify -">
Match the list of notification conditions, or NOTIFY values, associated with the
TO address used in the SMTP RCPT TO command that resulted in this message getting
delivered to this user.  More than one notification condition can be in
effect at once; each condition that is in effect is tested separately, and any
match causes the test to succeed.  The syntax and semantics of the NOTIFY
parameter are defined in Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC3461">RFC 3461</xref> .
Currently, the possible notification condition values are "NEVER", "SUCCESS",
"FAILURE", and "DELAY".  Note that the value "NEVER" is never combined
with any other value.
</t>

<t hangText='orcpt -'>
Match the original recipient, or ORCPT, value associated with the TO address
used in the SMTP RCPT TO command that resulted in this message getting
delivered to this user, with xtext encoding removed.  The syntax and semantics
of the ORCPT parameter are defined in Section 4.2 of
<xref target="RFC3461">RFC 3461</xref>. 
</t>

<t hangText='ret -'>
Match the return of content, or RET, value given in the SMTP MAIL FROM command.
The syntax and semantics of the RET parameter are
defined in Section 4.3 of <xref target="RFC3461">RFC 3461</xref>.  The
possible return of content values are "FULL" and "HDRS".
</t>

<t hangText='envid -'>
Match the envelope identifier, or ENVID, value in decoded form given in the
SMTP MAIL FROM command.  The syntax and semantics of the ENVID parameter are
defined in Section 4.4 of <xref target="RFC3461">RFC&nbsp;3461</xref>.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
The envelope test fails unconditionally for each of these envelope-part strings
if the specified envelope parameter
does not exist for the current message or recipient.
</t>

<t>
The envelope test's ADDRESS-PART argument assumes the string being tested
has the syntax of an email address.  None of the new envelope parts defined
here have address syntax; accordingly, it is an error to specify an
ADDRESS-PART argument in conjunction with these new envelope parts.
</t>

<t>
The "relational" extension <xref target='RFC5231' /> adds a match
type called ":count".  The count of an envelope test with an envelope-part of
"orcpt", "ret", and "envid" is 1 if the corresponding SMTP parameter is present
and 0 otherwise.  The count of an envelope test with an envelope-part of "notify"
is equal to the number of notification conditions
specified and 0 if the NOTIFY parameter is not present.
</t>

<section anchor="envelope-dsn-examples" title="Examples">

<t>
The fact that the NOTIFY envelope parameter is multivalued and
the notify envelope-part turns this into a list of values makes 
it easy to check to see if a given value is present without having to worry
about other values:
</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
require ["envelope", "envelope-dsn"];

# Check whether SUCCESS notifications were requested,
# irrespective of any other requests that were made
if envelope "notify" "SUCCESS"
{
    # do whatever
}
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
Checking to see if a given request is the only one present
is a little trickier, however:
</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
require ["envelope", "envelope-dsn", "relational",
         "comparator-i;ascii-numeric"];

# Check whether only FAILURE notifications were requested
if allof ( envelope "notify" "FAILURE",
           envelope :comparator "i;ascii-numeric"
                    :count "eq" "notify" "1"
         )
{
    # do whatever
}
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
The orcpt envelope-part always contains an address type indicator prefix
in addition to an address, which must be taken into account in any
tests:
</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
require ["envelope", "envelope-dsn"];

# See if the orcpt is an RFC822 address in the example.com
# domain
if envelope :matches "orcpt" "rfc822;*@example.com"
{
    # do whatever
}
]]></artwork></figure>

</section>

</section>

<section anchor="envelope-deliverby" title="Envelope-deliverby Extension">

<t>
The "envelope-deliverby" extension does not define any new tests or actions;
rather,
it adds four values to the list of possible (case-insensitive) envelope-part
strings defined in Section 5.4 of <xref target='RFC5228' /> and an optional
:zone tagged argument.  This updates the usage description for envelope to:
</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Usage:   envelope [COMPARATOR] [ADDRESS-PART]
                  [MATCH-TYPE] [:zone <time-zone: string>]
                  <envelope-part: string-list>
                  <key-list: string-list>
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
These new envelope
parts correspond to the new MAIL FROM parameters defined in Section 4 of
<xref target='RFC2852' />.  They are:
</t>

<t>
<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="bytimeabsolute -">
Match the current value of the initial integer part of the Deliver-By
extension's BY parameter on the SMTP MAIL FROM command, converted into
an absolute time represented in restricted ISO 8601 format.
The restricted ISO 8601 format is specified by the date-time ABNF
production given in <xref target='RFC3339' />, Section 5.6, with the added
restrictions that the letters "T" and "Z" MUST be in upper case, and
a time zone offset of zero MUST be represented by "Z" and not
"+00:00".
</t>

<t hangText="bytimerelative -">
Match the current value of the initial integer part of the Deliver-By
extension's BY parameter specified in the SMTP MAIL FROM command.
</t>

<t hangText='bymode -'>
Match a string computed from the by-mode part of the Deliver-By extension's BY
parameter.  The possible values are "notify" and "return", which correspond to
the BY parameter mode specifier characters "N" and "R", respectively.
</t>

<t hangText='bytrace -'>
Match the trace modifier computed from the by-trace modifier on the Deliver-By
extension's BY parameter.  The possible values are "trace" and "" (the empty string).
These values correspond to the presence or absence of the by-trace "T"
modifier, respectively.
</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>
The envelope test fails unconditionally for each of these envelope-part strings
if the BY SMTP MAIL FROM parameter does not exist for the current message or 
recipient.
</t>

<t>
The new :zone argument specifies a time zone offset string that any
bytimeabsolute value is to be shifted to prior to testing.  :zone has no
effect on envelope-parts other than bytimeabsolute.
The value of the time zone offset string MUST be an offset relative to
UTC with the following syntax:
</t>

<figure><artwork type="abnf"><![CDATA[
time-zone  =  ( "+" / "-" ) 4DIGIT
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
The "+" or "-" indicates whether the time-of-day is ahead of (i.e.,
east of) or behind (i.e., west of) UTC.  The first two digits
indicate the number of hours difference from Universal Time, and the
last two digits indicate the number of minutes difference from
Universal Time.  Note that this agrees with the <xref target="RFC5322" />
format for time zone offsets, not the ISO 8601 format.  The local time zone
MUST be used for bytimeabsolute if the :zone argument is omitted.
</t>

<t>
The envelope test's ADDRESS-PART argument assumes the string being tested
has the syntax of an email address.  None of the new envelope parts defined
here have address syntax; accordingly, it is an error to specify an
ADDRESS-PART argument in conjunction with these new envelope parts.
</t>

<t>
The "relational" extension <xref target='RFC5231' /> adds a match
type called ":count".  The count of an envelope test with an envelope-part of
"bytime", "bymode", and "bytrace" is 1 if the BY parameter is present
and 0 otherwise. 
</t>

<t>
It is important to note that the Deliver-By by-time is decremented as the
message passes through the transport infrastructure.  Accordingly, it is not
possible to tell what the message originator set the value to; only the amount
of time remaining at the moment the sieve is run can be determined.
Additionally, note that
bytimerelative values can be negative, making it necessary to either perform
additional checks or else use a comparator that, unlike i;ascii-numeric,
is capable of handling signed integers.
</t>

<section anchor="envelope-deliverby-examples" title="Examples">

<t>
As noted above, this extension does not provide access to the originator's
initial by-time setting for the simple reason that this information is not
part of the envelope.  It can, however, be used to check and see if the message
was delivered within the allotted time.  Note the additional check to see if
the value is negative:
</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
require ["envelope", "envelope-deliverby", "relational",
         "comparator-i;ascii-numeric"];

# Check to see if this message didn't make it in the time allotted by
# the originator.
if anyof (envelope :contains "bytimerelative" "-",
          envelope :value "eq" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric"
                   "bytimerelative" "0")
{
    # do whatever
}
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
This operation can be done more simply if the date <xref target='RFC5260' />
and variables <xref target='RFC5229' /> extensions are
available:
</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
require ["envelope", "envelope-deliverby", "relational", "date",
         "variables"];

# Check to see if this message didn't make it in the time allotted by
# the originator.
if currentdate :matches "iso8601" "*" {
    set "cdate" "${0}";
    if envelope :value "ge" "bytimeabsolute" "${cdate}" {
        # do whatever
    }
}
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
Note that there is no need to force the use of a particular time zone
since both currentdate and the bytimeabsolute value are required to
default to the local time zone.  A similar check could be written using
:zone if the action taken depends on having the by-time represented in a
particular zone:
</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
require ["envelope", "envelope-deliverby", "relational", "date",
         "variables"];

# If the message didn't make it in time, file it according to when it
# should have been received
if envelope :matches :zone "+0000" "bytimeabsolute" "*T*:*:*" {
    set "bdate" "${0}";
    set "bhour" "${2}";
    if currentdate :zone "+0000" :value "lt" "iso8601" "${bdate}")
        fileinto "missed-${bhour}";
    }
}
]]></artwork></figure>

<section anchor="redirect-dsn" title="redirect-dsn Extension">

<t>
The "redirect-dsn" extension does not define any new tests or actions;
rather, it adds two new arguments, NOTIFY and RET, to the redirect action
defined in Section 4.2 of <xref target='RFC5228' />.  This updates the usage
description for redirect to:
</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Usage:   redirect [:notify "value"] [:ret "FULL"|"HDRS"]
                  <address: string>
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
The syntax for the NOTIFY and RET arguments are:
</t>

<figure><artwork type="abnf"><![CDATA[
NOTIFY = ":notify" notify-value
notify-value = DQUOTE ("NEVER" / notify-esmtp-list) DQUOTE
notify-esmtp-list = notify-list-element *("," notify-list-element)

RET = ":ret" ret-value
ret-value = DQUOTE ("FULL" / "HDRS") DQUOTE
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
The notify-list-element ABNF production is defined in Section 4.1 of
<xref target='RFC3461' />.
</t>

<t>
When these arguments are specified, they set the corresponding NOTIFY
ESMTP RCPT TO and RET ESMTP MAIL FROM parameters, respectively.
These arguments are only honored if the delivery status
notification (DSN) ESMTP extension is available.  When the DSN
extension is not available, these arguments MUST be ignored and
MUST NOT cause an error.
</t>

<section anchor="mail-from-dsn" title="MAIL FROM Address Selection">

<t>
RFC 5228 does not require that any particular envelope sender address
be associated
with redirected messages.  However, the redirect-dsn extension isn't terribly
useful if the place where the delivery status notifications are sent isn't
known.  Accordingly, when either :notify or :ret is specified and the envelope
sender address isn't empty, implementations MUST set the envelope sender
address to the address of the sieve owner. 
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="redirect-dsn-example" title="Example">

<t>
One possible use of :notify on redirect is to combine the copy
extension <xref target='RFC3894' /> with the ability to
suppress nondelivery notifications to generate a private
copy of selected messages with no side effects or error
notifications:
</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
require ["copy", "redirect-dsn"];

# Make a private copy of messages from user@example.com
if address "from" "user@example.com"
{
    redirect :copy :notify "NEVER" "elsewhere@example.com";
}
]]></artwork></figure>

</section>

</section>


<section anchor="redirect-deliverby" title="redirect-deliverby Extension">

<t>
The "redirect-deliverby" extension does not define any new tests or actions;
rather, it adds three new arguments, BYTIME, BYMODE, and BYTRACE, to the
redirect action 
defined in Section 4.2 of <xref target='RFC5228' />.  This updates the usage
description for redirect to:
</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Usage:   redirect [:bytimerelative <rlimit: number> /
                   :bytimeabsolute <alimit:string>
                   [:bymode "notify"|"return"] [:bytrace]]
                  <address: string>
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
:bytimerelative specifies the number of seconds within which the message
should be delivered.  This parameter does not allow specification of
negative values; it should not be necessary to specify such values in
this context.  :bytimeabsolute specifies an absolute time limit on
delivery.  The
limit in this case is specified in the restricted ISO 8601 format specified
by the date-time ABNF production given in <xref target='RFC3339' />.
</t>

<t>
:bymode specifies whether a notification should
be sent or the message simply returned if the time limit is exceeded.  The
default is "return" if :bymode is not specified.  :bytrace, if specified,
activates message tracing.
</t>

<t>
The semantics of delivery time limits and these parameters are specified and
discussed at length in <xref target="RFC2852"/>.
</t>

<t>
It is an error to specify either :bymode or :bytrace without either
:bytimeabsolute or :bytimerelative.
</t>

<t>
When these arguments are specified, they are used to construct the
corresponding BY ESMTP MAIL FROM parameter.  The :bytimeabsolute or
:bytimerelative value becomes the by-time, the :bymode becomes the by-mode
value, and :bytrace sets the by-trace modifier.  If the Deliver-By extension is
unavailable, the handling of the redirected message MUST conform
to the semantics specified in <xref target="RFC2852"/>,
Section&nbsp;4.1.4 for
relaying to a server that does not support the Deliver-By SMTP extension.
</t>

<section anchor="mail-from-deliverby" title="MAIL FROM Address Selection">

<t>
RFC 5228 does not require that any particular envelope sender address be

redirect-dsn extension, isn't terribly useful if the place where any

<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

<t>
The envelope-dsn and envelope-deliverby extensions provide access to additional
message envelope information.  This is not believed to raise any additional
security issues beyond those for the Sieve "envelope" test.
</t>

<t>
The redirect-dsn extension allows specification of the delivery status
notification's NOTIFY parameter, which can cause the generation of notification
messages that might otherwise not be generated, especially if notification in
the event of successful delivery is required.  Sites that limit the ability
to request success notifications will also need to restrict the ability
to request them using the redirect-dsn extension.
</t>

<t>
Similarly, the redirect-deliverby extension is used to control how long the
transport infrastructure will continue to attempt to deliver a message before
giving up, which could result in the generation of additional notification
messages.  While the underlying Deliver-By extension does have a minimum
by-time limit, sites may wish to impose additional limits on the minimum
by-time allowed in a redirect action.
</t>

<t>
All of the security considerations given in the base Sieve
specification also apply to this extension.
