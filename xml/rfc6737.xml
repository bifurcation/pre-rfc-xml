		<abstract>
			<t>
				This document defines a new Diameter application and associated
				Command Codes.
				The Capabilities Update application is intended to
				allow the dynamic update of certain Diameter peer capabilities while the
				peer-to-peer connection is in the open state.

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>
				Capabilities exchange is an important component of the Diameter base
				protocol <xref target="RFC6733"/>,
				allowing peers to exchange identities and
				Diameter capabilities (protocol version number, supported Diameter
				applications, security mechanisms, etc.).  
				As defined in RFC 3588,
				however, the capabilities exchange process takes place only once, at
				the inception of a transport connection between a given pair of
				peers.
				Therefore, if a peer's capabilities change (due to a software
				update, for example), the existing connection(s) must be torn down
				(along with all of the associated user sessions) and restarted before
				the modified capabilities can be advertised.
				</t><t>
				This document defines a new Diameter application intended to allow
				the dynamic update of a subset of Diameter peer capabilities over an existing
				connection.  
				Because the Capabilities Update application specified
				herein operates over an existing transport connection, modification of
				certain capabilities is prohibited.
				Specifically, modifying the security mechanism in use is not allowed; if the security method
				used between a pair of peers is changed, the affected connection MUST
				be restarted.
			</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Specification of Requirements">
			<t>
				The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
				"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
				document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.
			</t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="DPC" title="Diameter Protocol Considerations">
			<t>
				This section details the relationship of the Diameter Capabilities
				Update application to the Diameter base protocol.
				</t><t>
				This document specifies Diameter Application-Id 10.
				Diameter
				nodes conforming to this specification MUST advertise support by
				including the value 10 in the Auth-Application-Id of the
				Capabilities-Exchange-Request (CER) and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer (CEA) commands 
				<xref target="RFC6733"/>.
			</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Capabilities Update">
			<t>
				When the capabilities of a Diameter node conforming to this
				specification change, the node MUST notify all
of the nodes with which it
				has an open transport connection 
				and which have also advertised support for the Capabilities Update application
				using the Capabilities-Update-Request (CUR)
				message (<xref target="C-U-R"/>).
				This message allows the update of a peer's
				capabilities (supported
				Diameter applications, etc.).
				</t><t>
				A Diameter node only issues a given command to those peers that have advertised
				support for the Diameter application that defines the command;
				a Diameter node must cache the supported applications in order to
				ensure that unrecognized commands and/or Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs) are not unnecessarily
				sent to a peer.
				</t><t>
				The receiver of the CUR MUST determine
				common applications by computing the intersection of its own set of
				supported Application Ids against all of the Application-Id
				AVPs (Auth-Application-Id, Acct-Application-Id, and Vendor-Specific-Application-Id) present in the CUR.  The value of the Vendor-Id AVP
				in the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id MUST NOT be used during
				computation.
				</t><t>
				If the receiver of a CUR does not
				have any applications in common with the sender, then it MUST return a
				Capabilities-Update-Answer (CUA) (<xref target="C-U-A"/>)
				with the Result-Code AVP set to
				DIAMETER_NO_COMMON_APPLICATION <xref target="RFC6733"/>,
				and it SHOULD disconnect the transport-layer connection. However, if active sessions are using the
				connection, peers MAY delay disconnection until the sessions can be
				redirected or gracefully terminated.  Note that receiving a 
				CUA from a peer advertising itself as a relay (see <xref target="RFC6733"/>, 
				Section	2.4) MUST be interpreted as having common applications with the peer.
				</t><t>
				As for CER/CEA messages, the CUR and CUA messages MUST NOT be proxied, redirected, or relayed.
				</t><t>
				Even though the CUR/CUA messages cannot be proxied, it is still possible
				for an upstream agent to receive a message for which there are no
				peers available to handle the application that corresponds to the
				Command Code.  This could happen if, for example, the peers are too busy or down.
				In such instances, the 'E' bit MUST be set in the answer
				message with the Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER to
				inform the downstream peer to take action (e.g., re-routing requests
				to an alternate peer).
			</t>
			<section anchor="C-CV" title="Command Code Values">
				<t>
					This section defines Command Code <xref target="RFC6733"/>
					values that MUST be
					supported by all Diameter implementations conforming to this
					specification.
					The following Command Codes are defined 
					in this
					document: Capabilities-Update-Request (CUR, <xref target="C-U-R"/>),
					and
					Capabilities-Update-Answer (CUA, <xref target="C-U-A"/>).  The Diameter
  Command Code Format (CCF) (<xref target="RFC6733" />, Section 3.2) is used in the
  definitions.
				</t>
				<section title="Capabilities-Update-Request" anchor="C-U-R">
					<t>
						The Capabilities-Update-Request (CUR), indicated by the Command Code
						set to 328 and the Command Flags' 'R' bit set, is sent to update
						local capabilities.
						Upon detection of a transport failure, this message MUST NOT be sent to an alternate peer.
						</t><t>
						When Diameter is run over the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) <xref target="RFC4960"/>, 
						which allows connections to
						span multiple interfaces and multiple IP addresses, the Capabilities-Update-Request message MUST contain one Host-IP-Address AVP for each
						potential IP address that may be locally used when transmitting
						Diameter messages.
