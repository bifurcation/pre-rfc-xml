         <t>This memo defines an extension to the SMTP service whereby an SMTP
            content body consisting of text containing octets outside of the
            US&nbhy;ASCII octet range (hex 00-7F) may be relayed using
            SMTP.</t>

      <section
         title="Introduction">
         <t>Although SMTP is widely and robustly deployed, various extensions
            have been requested by parts of the Internet community. In
            particular, a significant portion of the Internet community wishes
            to exchange messages in which the content body consists of a MIME
            message <xref target="RFC2045" /><xref
               target="RFC2046" /><xref
               target="RFC5322" /> containing arbitrary octet-aligned material.
            This memo uses the mechanism described in the SMTP
			specification <xref target="RFC5321" />
			 to define an extension to the SMTP service
            whereby such contents may be exchanged. Note that this extension
            does NOT eliminate the possibility of an SMTP server limiting line
            length; servers are free to implement this extension but
            nevertheless set a line length limit no lower than 1000 octets.
            Given that this restriction still applies, this extension does NOT
            provide a means for transferring unencoded binary via SMTP.

         title="Framework for the 8-bit MIME Transport Extension">
         <t>The 8-bit MIME transport extension is laid out as follows: <list
               style="numbers">
               <t>the name of the SMTP service extension defined here is
                  8bit&nbhy;MIMEtransport;</t>
               <t>the EHLO keyword value associated with
                  the extension is 8BITMIME;</t>
               <t>no parameter is used with the 8BITMIME EHLO keyword;</t>
               <t>one optional parameter using the keyword BODY is added to the
                  MAIL command. The value associated with this parameter is
                  a keyword indicating whether a 7-bit message (in strict
                  compliance with <xref
                     target="RFC5321" />) or a MIME message (in strict
                  compliance with <xref
                     target="RFC2046" /> and <xref
                     target="RFC2045" />) with arbitrary octet content is being
                  sent. The syntax of the value is as follows, using the ABNF
                  notation of <xref
                     target="RFC5234" />: <vspace blankLines="1"/> <figure>
                     <artwork><![CDATA[    body-value = "7BIT" / "8BITMIME"]]></artwork>
                  </figure></t>
               <t>no additional SMTP verbs are defined by this extension;
                  and</t>
               <t>the next section specifies how support for the extension
                  affects the behavior of a server and client SMTP.</t>
            </list></t>
      </section>

      <section
         title="The 8bit-MIMEtransport Service Extension">
         <t>When a client SMTP wishes to submit (using the MAIL command) a
            content body consisting of a MIME message containing arbitrary lines
            of octet-aligned material, it first issues the EHLO command to the
            server SMTP. If the server SMTP responds with code 250 to the EHLO
            command, and the response includes the EHLO keyword value 8BITMIME,
            then the server SMTP is indicating that it supports the extended
            MAIL command and will accept MIME messages containing arbitrary
            octet-aligned material.</t>

         <t>The extended MAIL command is issued by a client SMTP when it wishes
            to transmit a content body consisting of a MIME message containing
            arbitrary lines of octet-aligned material. The syntax for this
            command is identical to the MAIL command in RFC 5321,
			except that a BODY parameter must appear 
            after the address. Only one BODY parameter may be used in a single
            MAIL command. </t>


         <t>The complete syntax of this extended command is defined in
            RFC 5321. The esmtp-keyword is BODY, and the syntax for
            esmtp-value is given by the syntax for body-value shown above.</t>

         <t>The value associated with the BODY parameter indicates whether the
            content body that will be passed using the DATA command consists of
            a MIME message containing some arbitrary octet-aligned material
            ("8BITMIME") or is encoded entirely in accordance with 
            RFC 5321 ("7BIT"). </t>
         <t>A server that supports the 8-bit MIME transport service extension
            shall preserve all bits in each octet passed using the DATA command.
            Naturally, the usual SMTP data-stuffing algorithm applies, so that a
            content that contains the five-character sequence of <figure>
               <artwork><![CDATA[<CR> <LF> <DOT> <CR> <LF>]]></artwork>
            </figure> or a content that begins with the three-character sequence
            of <figure>
               <artwork><![CDATA[<DOT> <CR> <LF>]]></artwork>
            </figure> does not prematurely terminate the transfer of the
            content. Further, it should be noted that the CR-LF pair immediately
            preceding the final dot is considered part of the content. Finally,
            although the content body contains arbitrary lines of octet-aligned
            material, the length of each line (number of octets between two
            CR-LF pairs) is still subject to SMTP server line length
            restrictions (which can allow as few as 1000 octets, inclusive of
            the CR-LF pair, on a single line). This restriction means that this
            extension provides the necessary facilities for transferring a MIME
            object with the 8BIT content-transfer-encoding, it DOES NOT provide
            a means of transferring an object with the BINARY
            content-transfer-encoding. </t>

         <t>Once a server SMTP supporting the 8bit-MIMEtransport service
            extension accepts a content body containing octets with the high-
            order (8th) bit set, the server SMTP must deliver or relay the
            content in such a way as to preserve all bits in each octet.</t>

         <t>If a server SMTP does not support the 8-bit MIME transport extension
            (either by not responding with code 250 to the EHLO command, or by
            not including the EHLO keyword value 8BITMIME in its response), then
            the client SMTP must not, under any circumstances, attempt to
            transfer a content that contains characters outside of the US-ASCII
            octet range (hex 00-7F).</t>

         <t>A client SMTP has two options in this case: first, it may implement
a gateway transformation to convert the message into valid 7-bit MIME, or
second, it may treat the barrier to 8-bit as a permanent error and handle it in
the usual manner for delivery failures.  The specifics of the
            transformation from 8-bit MIME to 7-bit MIME are not described by this
            RFC; the conversion is nevertheless constrained in the following
            ways: <list
               style="numbers">
               <t>it must cause no loss of information; MIME transport encodings
                  must be employed as needed to insure this is the case, and</t>
               <t>the resulting message must be valid 7-bit MIME.</t>
            </list></t>
      </section>

      <section
         title="Security Considerations">
         <t>This RFC does not discuss security issues and is not believed to
            raise any security issues not already endemic in electronic mail
            and present in fully conforming implementations of 
            RFC 5321, including attacks facilitated by the
            presence of an option negotiation mechanism.

            Since MIME semantics are transport-neutral, the 8BITMIME option
            provides no more added capability to disseminate malware than is
            provided by unextended 7-bit SMTP.

                  <t>This document is a specification of the basic protocol for
                     Internet electronic mail transport. It consolidates,
                     updates, and clarifies several previous documents, making
                     all or parts of most of them obsolete. It covers the SMTP

                     contains information that is important to its use as a
                     "mail submission" protocol for "split-UA" (User Agent) mail

               <abstract>
                  <t>Internet technical specifications often need to define a
                     formal syntax. Over the years, a modified version of
                     Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has
                     been popular among many Internet specifications. The
                     current specification documents ABNF. It balances
                     compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational
                     power. The differences between standard BNF and ABNF
                     involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives,
                     order-independence, and value ranges. This specification
                     also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for
                     a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several
                     Internet specifications. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t>

                  <t>STD 11, RFC 822, defines a message representation protocol
                     specifying considerable detail about US-ASCII message
                     headers, and leaves the message content, or message body,
                     as flat US-ASCII text. This set of documents, collectively
                     called the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, or MIME,
                     redefines the format of messages to allow for</t>
                  <t>(1) textual message bodies in character sets other than
                     US-ASCII,</t>
                  <t>(2) an extensible set of different formats for non-textual
                     message bodies,</t>
                  <t>(3) multi-part message bodies, and</t>
                  <t>(4) textual header information in character sets other than
                     US-ASCII.</t>
                  <t>These documents are based on earlier work documented in RFC
                     934, STD 11, and RFC 1049, but extends and revises them.
                     Because RFC 822 said so little about message bodies, these
                     documents are largely orthogonal to (rather than a revision
                     of) RFC 822.</t>
                  <t>This initial document specifies the various headers used to
                     describe the structure of MIME messages. The second
                     document, RFC 2046, defines the general structure of the
                     MIME media typing system and defines an initial set of
                     media types. The third document, RFC 2047, describes
                     extensions to RFC 822 to allow non-US-ASCII text data in
                     Internet mail header fields. The fourth document, RFC 2048,
                     specifies various IANA registration procedures for
                     MIME-related facilities. The fifth and final document, RFC
                     2049, describes MIME conformance criteria as well as
                     providing some illustrative examples of MIME message
                     formats, acknowledgements, and the bibliography.</t>
                  <t>These documents are revisions of RFCs 1521, 1522, and 1590,
                     which themselves were revisions of RFCs 1341 and 1342. An
                     appendix in RFC 2049 describes differences and changes from
                     previous versions.</t>
