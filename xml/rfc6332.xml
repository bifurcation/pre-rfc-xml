    <abstract>
      <t>In most RTP-based multicast applications, the RTP source sends
      inter-related data. Due to this interdependency, randomly joining RTP
      receivers usually cannot start consuming the multicast data right after
      they join the session. Thus, they often experience a random acquisition
      delay. An RTP receiver can use one or more different approaches to
      achieve rapid acquisition. Yet, due to various factors, performance of
      the rapid acquisition methods usually varies. Furthermore, in some cases,
      the RTP receiver can do a simple multicast join (in other cases, it is
      compelled to do so). For quality reporting, monitoring, and diagnostic
      purposes, it is important to collect detailed information from the RTP
      receivers about their acquisition and presentation experiences. This
      document addresses this issue by defining a new report block type,
      called the Multicast Acquisition (MA) report block, within the framework of
      RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XRs) (RFC 3611). This
      document also defines the necessary signaling of the new MA report block
      type in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is the out-of-band control protocol for
      applications that use the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
      for media transport <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>. In addition to
      providing minimal control functionality to RTP entities, RTCP also
      enables a basic-level monitoring of RTP sessions via sender and receiver
      reports. More statistically detailed monitoring as well as
      application-specific monitoring are usually achieved through the RTCP
      Extended Reports (XRs) <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>.</t>

      <t>In most RTP-based multicast applications such as the ones carrying
      video content, the RTP source sends inter-related data. Consequently,
      the RTP application may not be able to decode and present the data in an
      RTP packet before decoding the data in one or more earlier RTP packets and/or before
      acquiring some Reference Information about the content itself. Thus, RTP
      receivers that are randomly joining a multicast session often experience
      a random acquisition delay. In order to reduce this delay, <xref
      target="RFC6285"></xref> proposes an
      approach where an auxiliary unicast RTP session is established between a
      retransmission server and the joining RTP receiver. Over this unicast
      RTP session, the retransmission server provides the Reference
      Information, which is all the information the RTP receiver needs to
      rapidly acquire the multicast stream. This method is referred to as the
      Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions (RAMS). However, depending on
      the variability in the Source Filtering Group Management Protocol
      (SFGMP) processing times, the availability of network resources for rapid
      acquisition, and the nature of the RTP data, not all RTP receivers can
      acquire the multicast stream in the same amount of time. The performance
      of rapid acquisition may vary not only for different RTP receivers but
      also over time.</t>

      <t>To increase the visibility of the multicast service provider in its
      network, to diagnose slow multicast acquisition issues, and to collect
      the acquisition experiences of the RTP receivers, this document defines
      a new report block type, which is called the Multicast Acquisition (MA)
      report block, within the framework of RTCP XR. RTP receivers that 
      use the method described in <xref
      target="RFC6285"></xref> may use this
      report every time they join a new multicast RTP session. RTP receivers
      that use a different method for rapid acquisition or those that do not use
      any method but rather do a simple multicast join may also use this
      report. This way, the multicast service provider
      can quantitatively compare the improvements achieved by different
      methods.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec_acr" title="Definitions">
      <t>This document uses the acronyms and definitions from Section 3 of
      <xref target="RFC6285"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec_mjxr" title="Multicast Acquisition (MA) Report Block">
      <t>This section defines the format of the MA report block. The base
      report is payload independent. An extension mechanism is provided where
      further optional payload-independent and payload-specific information
      can be included in the report as desired.</t>

      <t>The OPTIONAL extensions that are defined in this document are
      primarily developed for the method presented in <xref
      target="RFC6285"></xref>. Other methods
      that provide rapid acquisition can define their own extensions to be
      used in the MA report block.</t>

      <t>The packet format for the RTCP XR is defined in Section 2 of <xref
      target="RFC3611"></xref>. Each XR packet has a fixed-length field for
      version, padding, reserved bits, payload type (PT), length,
synchronization source (SSRC) of
      packet sender as well as a variable-length field for report blocks. In
      the XR packets, the PT field is set to XR (207).</t>

      <t>It is better to send the MA report block after all the necessary
      information is collected and computed. Partial reporting is generally
      not useful as it cannot give the full picture of the multicast
      acquisition, and it causes additional complexity in terms of report block
      matching and correlation. The MA report block is only sent as a part of
      an RTCP compound packet, and it is sent in the primary multicast
      session.</t>

      <t>The need for reliability of the MA report block is not any greater
      than other report blocks or types. If desired, the report block could be
      repeated for redundancy purposes while respecting the RTCP scheduling
      algorithms.</t>

      <t>Following the rules specified in <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>, all
      integer fields in the base report and extensions defined below are
      carried in network-byte order, that is, most significant byte (octet)
      first, also known as big-endian. Unless otherwise stated, numeric
      constants are in decimal (base 10).</t>

      <section title="Base Report">
        <t>The base report format is shown in <xref

            target="sec_codes_registry"></xref>. If a new vendor-neutral
            status code will be defined, it MUST be registered with IANA
            according to the guidelines specified in <xref
            target="sec_codes_registry"></xref>. If the new status code is
            intended to be used privately by a vendor, there is no need for
            IANA management. <xref target="sec_private"></xref> defines how a
            vendor defines and uses private extensions to convey its messages.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />To indicate use of a private extension,
            the RTP receiver MUST set the Status field to zero. A private
            extension MUST NOT be used in an XR unless the RTP receiver
            knows from out-of-band methods that the entity that will receive
            and process the XR understands the private extension.</t>

            <t>Rsvd. (16 bits): The RTP receiver MUST set this field to zero.
            The recipient MUST ignore this field when received.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>If the multicast join was successful, meaning that at least one
        multicast packet was received, some additional information MUST
        be appended to the base report as described in <xref
        target="sec_ext"></xref>.</t>

        <section title="Status Code Rules for New MA Methods">
          <t>Different MA methods usually use different status codes, although
          some status codes (e.g., a code indicating that multicast join has
          failed) can be common among multiple MA methods. The status code
          reported in the base report MUST always be within the scope of the
          particular MA method specified in the MA Method field.</t>

          <t>In certain MA methods, the RTP receiver can generate a status
          code for its multicast acquisition attempt or can be told by
          another network element or RTP endpoint what the current status is
          via a response code. In such cases, the RTP receiver MAY report the
          value of the received response code as its status code if the
          response code has a higher priority. Each MA method needs to outline
          the rules pertaining to its response and status codes so that RTP
          receiver implementations can determine what to report in any given
          scenario.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Status Code Rules for the RAMS Method">
          <t>In this section, we provide the status code rules for the RAMS
          method described in <xref
          target="RFC6285"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Section 11.6 of <xref
          target="RFC6285"></xref> defines
          several response codes. The 1xx- and 2xx-level response codes are
          informational and success response codes, respectively. If the RTP
          receiver receives a 1xx- or 2xx-level response code, then the RTP
          receiver MUST use one of the 1xxx-level status codes defined in
          <xref target="sec_codes_registry"></xref> of this document. If the
          RTP receiver receives a 4xx- or 5xx-level response code (indicating
          receiver-side and server-side errors, respectively), then the RTP
          receiver MUST use the response code as its status code. In other
          words, the 4xx- and 5xx-level response codes have a higher priority
          than the 1xxx-level status codes.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Extensions">
        <t>To improve the reporting scope, it might be desirable to define new
        fields in the MA report block. Such fields are to be encoded as TLV
        elements as described below and sketched in <xref
        target="fig_tlv"></xref>:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Type: A single-octet identifier that defines the type of the
            parameter represented in this TLV element.</t>

            <t>Length: A two-octet field that indicates the length (in octets)
            of the TLV element excluding the Type and Length fields and the
            8-bit Reserved field between them. Note that this length does not
            include any padding that is needed for alignment.</t>

            <t>Value: Variable-size set of octets that contains the specific
            value for the parameter.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In the extensions, the Reserved field MUST be set to zero and
        ignored on reception. If a TLV element does not fall on a 32-bit
        boundary, the last word MUST be padded to the boundary using further
        bits set to zero.</t>

        <t>In the MA report block, the RTP receiver MUST place any
        vendor-neutral or private extension after the base report.</t>

          <t>It is desirable to allow vendors to use private extensions in TLV
          format. The range of [128-254] of TLV Types is reserved for private
          extensions. IANA management for these extensions is unnecessary;
          they are the responsibility of individual vendors.</t>

          <t>Implementations use the structure depicted in <xref
          target="fig_tlvext"></xref> for private extensions. Here, the
          private enterprise numbers are used from
          http://www.iana.org. This will ensure
          the uniqueness of the private extensions and avoid any
          collision.</t>

             title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations of <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> apply
      in this document as well.</t>

      <t>The information contained in MA reports could be stolen as with any other
      RTCP reports if proper protection mechanism(s) are not in place. If
      desired, similar to other RTCP XRs, the MA reports MAY be
      protected by using Secure RTP (SRTP) and Secure RTP Control Protocol
      (SRTCP) <xref target="RFC3711"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Malicious sniffing or otherwise obtaining MA report blocks can reveal
      performance characteristics of the RTP service and underlying network.
      This information is mostly available to an observer with the ability to
      capture RTP and RTCP session traffic. The contents and value of any
      private extension need to be studied when considering the necessity to
      secure the MA reports since application-level performance data might be
      present that is not otherwise available to an attacker, as with the
      required fields and vendor-neutral extensions.</t>

      <t>Using the MA reports to provide feedback into the acquisition of the
      multicast streams can introduce possible additional security
      implications. If a forged or otherwise modified MA report is received
      for an earlier acquisition attempt, invalid data can be used as input in
      later rapid acquisition attempts. For example, incorrectly small SFGMP
      join times could cause the unicast burst to be too short, leading to
      gaps in sequence numbers in the approach discussed in <xref
      target="RFC6285"></xref>. Additionally,
      forged reports could give the appearance that rapid acquisition is
      performing correctly when it is in fact failing, or vice versa. While
      integrity protection can be achieved in different ways, we
      RECOMMEND the use of SRTCP <xref target="RFC3711"></xref>.</t>
