    <abstract>
      <t>
        The framework for the preparation, enforcement, and comparison of
        internationalized strings (PRECIS) defines several classes of
        strings for use in application protocols. Because many protocols
        perform case-sensitive or case-insensitive string comparison, it is
        necessary to define methods for case mapping. In addition, both the
        Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) and the PRECIS
        problem statement describe mappings for internationalized strings
        that are not limited to case, but include width mapping and mapping
        of delimiters and other special characters that can be taken into
        consideration. This document provides guidelines for designers of
        PRECIS profiles and describes several mappings that can be applied
        between receiving user input and passing permitted code points to
        internationalized protocols. In particular, this document describes
        both locale-dependent and context-depending case mappings as well as
        additional mappings for delimiters and special characters.
      </t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        In many cases, user input of internationalized strings is generated
        through the use of an input method editor ("IME") or through copy-and-paste from free text.
        Users generally do not care about the case and/or width of input characters because they consider those
        characters to be functionally equivalent or visually identical. Furthermore, users rarely
        switch the IME state to input special characters such as protocol
        elements. 
      </t>
<t>
For Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), the IDNA Mapping
        specification <xref target="RFC5895"/> describes methods for handling these issues. 
        For PRECIS strings, case mapping and width mapping are defined in the PRECIS
        framework specification <xref target="RFC7564"/>.

        The case and width mappings defined in the PRECIS framework do not
        handle other mappings such as delimiter characters, special
        characters, and locale-dependent or context-dependent cases; these
        mappings are also important in order to increase the probability
        that the resulting strings compare as users expect.
	</t>
<t>        
        This document
        provides guidelines for authors of protocol profiles of the PRECIS
        framework and describes several mappings that can be applied between
        receiving user input and passing permitted code points to
        internationalized protocols. The delimiter mapping and special mapping
        rules described here are applied as "additional mappings" beyond those
        defined in the PRECIS framework,
        whereas the "local case mapping" rule provides locale-dependent
        and context-dependent alternative case mappings for specific target
        characters.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Protocol-Dependent Mappings" anchor="pdm">
      <t>
        The PRECIS framework defines several protocol-independent mappings.
        The additional mappings and local case mapping defined in this
	document are protocol dependent,
        i.e., they depend on the rules for a particular application protocol.
      </t>
      <section title="Delimiter Mapping">
        <t>
          Some application protocols define delimiters for their own use,
          resulting in the fact that the delimiters are different for each protocol.
          The delimiter mapping table should therefore be based on a well-defined
          mapping table for each protocol.
        </t>
        <t>
          Delimiter mapping is used to map characters that are similar to
          protocol delimiters into the canonical delimiter characters. For
          example, there are width-compatible characters that correspond to the
          '@' in email addresses and the ':' and '/' in URIs. The '+', '-', '&lt;' and '&gt;'
          characters are other common delimiters that might require
          such mapping. For the FULL STOP character (U+002E), a delimiter in
          the visual presentation of domain names, some IMEs produce a character
          such as IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP (U+3002) when a user types FULL STOP on
          the keyboard. In all these cases, the visually similar characters
          that can come from user input need to be mapped to the correct protocol
          delimiter characters before the string is passed to the protocol.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Special Mapping" anchor="spm"> 
        <t>
          Aside from delimiter characters, certain protocols have characters which need to be mapped
          in ways that are different from the rules specified in the PRECIS framework (e.g., mapping non-ASCII space characters to ASCII space).
          In this document, these mappings are called "special mappings". They are different for each protocol.
          Therefore, the special mapping table should be based on a well-defined mapping table for each protocol.       
          Examples of special mapping are the following;
          <list style='symbols'>

            <t>White spaces such as CHARACTER TABULATION (U+0009) or
	    IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE (U+3000) are mapped to SPACE (U+0020)</t>
            <t>Some characters such as control characters are mapped to nothing (Deletion)</t>
          </list>
          As examples, the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) <xref
	  target="RFC3748"/>, IMAP4 Access
	  Control List (ACL) <xref target="RFC4314"/>, and LDAPprep <xref target="RFC4518"/>
          define the rule that some code points for the non-ASCII space are mapped to SPACE (U+0020).
        </t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Local Case Mapping" anchor="lcm">
        <t>
          The purpose of local case mapping is to increase the probability of
          results that users expect when character case is changed (e.g., map
          uppercase to lowercase) between input and use in a protocol. Local
          case mapping selectively affects characters whose case mapping depends
          on locale and/or context.</t>

	  <t>
          (Note: The term "locale" in this document practically means
          "language" or "language and region" because the locale based on that
          language configuration of applications on POSIX is selected by
          "locale" information. See also the "Note" in Section 2.1.1 of RFC
          5646 <xref target="RFC5646"/>.)
        </t>
        <t>
          As an example of
          locale- and context-dependent mapping, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I ("I", U+0049) is
          normally mapped to LATIN SMALL LETTER I ("i", U+0069); however, if the language is
          Turkish (or one of several other languages), unless an I is before a dot_above, the
          character should be mapped to LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131).
        </t>
        <t>
          Case mapping using Unicode Default Case Folding in the PRECIS framework does not consider such locale or
          context because it is a common framework for internationalization.
          Local case mapping defined in this document correspond to demands
          from applications that support users' locale and/or context.
          The complete set of possible target characters for local case
          mapping are the characters specified in SpecialCasing.txt <xref target="Specialcasing"/> 
          in Section 3.13 of the Unicode Standard <xref target="Unicode"/>,
          but the specific set of target characters selected
          for local case mapping depends on locale and/or context, as
          further explained in SpecialCasing.txt.
        </t>
        <t>
          The case-folding method for a selected target character is to map
          into lowercase as defined in SpecialCasing.txt. The case-folding method for all other,
          non-target characters is as specified in Section 5.2.3 of the PRECIS
          framework.
          When an application
          supports users' locale and/or context, use of local case mapping can
          increase the probability that string comparisons yield the results that
          users expect.
        </t>
        <t>
          If a PRECIS profile selects Unicode Default Case Folding as the
          preferred method of case mapping, the profile designers may consider
          whether local case mapping can be applied.
          And, if it can be applied, it is better to add "alternatively, local case
          mapping might be applicable" after "Unicode Default Case Folding" so
          that application developers are aware of the alternative.  See 
          <xref target="vs"/> for a description of why local case mapping can be an
          alternative.

    <section title="Order of Operations" anchor="aom">
      <t>
        Delimiter mapping and special mapping as described in this document
        are expected to be applied as the "Additional Mapping Rule"
        mentioned in Section 5.2.2 of the PRECIS framework.  Although the
        delimiter mapping and special mapping could be applied in either
        order, this document recommends the following order to minimize
        the effect of code-point changes introduced by the mappings and to
        be acceptable to the widest user community:

 <section title="Why Local Case Mapping Is an Alternative to Case Mapping in the PRECIS Framework" anchor="vs">
        <t>

  Local case mapping and Unicode Default Case Folding are alternatives.
  They can't be applied simultaneously or sequentially.

          One outstanding issue regarding full case folding for characters is that some lowercase characters
          like "LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S" (U+00DF) (hereinafter referred to as "eszett") and ligatures
          like "LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FF" (U+FB00) that are described
          in the "Unconditional mappings" section of SpecialCasing.txt become a different code point
          when the case mapping is performed using Unicode Default Case Folding in the PRECIS framework.<vspace />
          In particular, German's eszett cannot keep the locale because eszett becomes two "LATIN SMALL LETTER S"s (U+0073 U+0073)
          when the case mapping is performed using Unicode Default Case
	  Folding. (See also 
  00DF in CaseFolding.txt <xref target="Casefolding"/>.)
          On the other hand, eszett doesn't become a different code point when performing the case mapping in SpecialCasing.txt.
          Therefore, if it is necessary to keep the locale of characters, PRECIS profile designers should select local case mapping
          as an alternative to Unicode Default Case Folding.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Limitations of Local Case Mapping" anchor="sigma">
        <t>
          As described in <xref target="lcm"/>, the possible target characters of local
          case mapping are specified in SpecialCasing.txt. The Unicode Standard
          (at least, up to version 7.0.0) does not define any context-dependent
          mappings between "GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA" (U+03C3) (hereinafter referred
          to as "small sigma") and "GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA" (U+03C2)
          (hereinafter referred to as "final sigma"). Thus, local case mapping
          is not applicable to small sigma or final sigma, so case mapping in
          the PRECIS framework always maps final sigma to small sigma, independent
          of context, as also specified by Unicode Default Case Folding.
          The following comments are from SpecialCasing.txt. (Line breaks have been added due to line-length limitations.)
