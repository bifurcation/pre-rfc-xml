<abstract>
<t>
The RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control (RTP/AVP)
is the basis for many other profiles, such as the Secure Real-time Transport
Protocol (RTP/SAVP), the Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control
Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF), and the Extended Secure RTP Profile
for RTCP-Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF).
This document updates RFC 3551, the RTP/AVP profile (and by extension,
the profiles that build upon it), to reflect changes in audio codec usage since
that document was originally published.

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
<t>
<xref target="RFC3551"/> says that audio applications operating under the
RTP/AVP profile SHOULD be able to send and receive PCMU and DVI4.
However, in practice, many RTP deployments do not support DVI4, and there is
little reason to use it when much more modern codecs are available.
This document updates the recommended audio codec selection for the RTP/AVP
profile and removes the SHOULD for DVI4.
By extension, this also updates the profiles that build on RTP/AVP, including
<xref target="RFC3711">RTP/SAVP</xref>,
<xref target="RFC4585">RTP/AVPF</xref>, and
<xref target="RFC5124">RTP/SAVPF</xref>.

<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>

<section anchor="updates" title="Updates to RFC 3551">
<t>
The following text of <xref target="RFC3551"/> is hereby updated as set forth
in <xref target="update-section-6"/>:
</t>

<t><list style="empty"><t>
Audio applications operating under this profile SHOULD, at a minimum,
be able to send and/or receive payload types 0&nbsp;(PCMU) and 5&nbsp;(DVI4).
This allows interoperability without format negotiation and ensures
successful negotiation with a conference control protocol.
</t></list></t>

<section anchor="update-section-6" title="Updates to Section 6 of RFC 3551">
<t>
This document updates the final paragraph of Section 6 of RFC 3551 by
replacing "payload types 0&nbsp;(PCMU) and 5&nbsp;(DVI4)" with
"payload type 0&nbsp;(PCMU)". We also add a final sentence to that
paragraph that states, "Some environments necessitate support for PCMU".
This results in the following paragraph:
</t>

<t><list style="empty"><t>
Audio applications operating under this profile SHOULD, at a minimum,
be able to send and/or receive payload type 0&nbsp;(PCMU). This allows
interoperability without format negotiation and ensures successful
negotiation with a conference control protocol. Some environments
necessitate support for PCMU.
