      <t>This document contains recommendations on how Internet Service
      Providers can use various remediation techniques to manage the effects
      of malicious bot infestations on computers used by their subscribers. 
Internet users with infected computers are exposed to risks such as
loss of personal data and increased susceptibility to online
fraud. Such computers can also become inadvertent participants in or
components of an online crime network, spam network, and/or phishing network as
well as be used as a part of a distributed denial-of-service attack. Mitigating
the effects of and remediating the installations of malicious bots will make it
more difficult for botnets to operate and could reduce the level of online
crime on the Internet in general and/or on a particular Internet Service
Provider's network.</t>
      
    <section anchor="terms" title="Key Terminology" toc="include">
      <t>This section defines the key terms used in this document.</t>

      <section title="Malicious Bots, or Bots">
        <t>A malicious or potentially malicious bot (derived from the word "robot", hereafter simply referred to as a "bot") refers to a program that is installed on a system in order to enable that system to automatically (or semi-automatically) perform a task or set of tasks typically under the command and control of a remote administrator, or "bot master". Bots are also known as "zombies". Such bots may have been installed surreptitiously, without the user's full understanding of what the bot will do once installed, unknowingly as part of another software installation, under false pretenses, and/or in a variety of other possible ways.</t> 
        
        <t>It is important to note that there are "good" bots. 
Such good bots
are often found interacting with a
computing resource in environments such as gaming and Internet Relay
Chat (IRC) <xref target="RFC1459"/>, where a continual, interactive presence
can be a requirement for participating in the games. 
Since such good bots are performing useful, lawful, and
non-disruptive functions, there is no reason for a provider to monitor for
their presence and/or alert users to their presence.</t>

        
        <t>While there may be good, or harmless bots, for the purposes of
this document, all mention of bots shall assume that the bots involved are
malicious or potentially malicious in nature. Such malicious bots shall
generally be assumed to have been deployed without the permission or conscious
understanding of a particular Internet user. Thus, without a user's knowledge,
bots may transform the user's computing device into a platform from which
malicious activities can be conducted. In addition, included explicitly in this
category are potentially malicious bots, which may initially appear neutral but
may simply be waiting for remote instructions to transform and/or otherwise
begin engaging in malicious behavior. In general, installation of a malicious
bot without user knowledge and consent is considered in most regions to be
unlawful, and the activities of malicious bots typically involve unlawful or
other maliciously disruptive activities.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Bot Networks, or Botnets" >
        <t>A "bot network", or "botnet", is defined as a concerted network of bots capable of acting on
instructions generated remotely. The malicious activities are either focused on
the information on the local machine or acting to provide services for remote
machines. Bots are highly customizable so they can be programmed to do many
things. The major malicious activities include but are not limited to identity
theft, spam, spim (spam over Instant Messaging (IM)), spit (spam over Internet
telephony), email address harvesting, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
attacks, key-logging, fraudulent DNS pharming (redirection), hosting proxy
services, fast flux (see <xref target="fastflux"/>) hosting, hosting of illegal content, use in man-in-the-middle attacks, and click fraud. </t>
        
        <t>Infection vectors (infection pathways) include un-patched operating
systems, software vulnerabilities (which include so-called zero-day
vulnerabilities where no patch yet exists), weak/non-existent passwords,
malicious web sites, un-patched browsers, malware, vulnerable helper
applications, inherently insecure protocols, protocols implemented without
security features switched on, and social engineering techniques to gain access
to the user's computer. The detection and destruction of bots is an ongoing
issue and also a constant battle between the Internet security community and
network security engineers on the one hand and bot developers on the other.</t>
       
        <t>Initially, some bots used IRC to communicate but were easy to
shut down if the command and control server was identified and
deactivated. Newer command and control methods have evolved, such that those
currently employed by bot masters make them much more resistant to
deactivation. With the introduction of peer-to-peer (P2P) architectures and associated
protocols, the use of HTTP and other resilient communication
protocols, and the widespread adoption of encryption, bots are
considerably more difficult to identify and isolate from typical network
usage. As a result, increased reliance is being placed on anomaly detection and
behavioral analysis, both locally and remotely, to identify bots.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Host" >
        <t>As used in the context of this document, the host or computer of an end user is intended to refer to a computing device that connects to the
Internet. This encompasses devices used by Internet users such as personal
computers (including laptops, desktops, and netbooks), mobile phones,
smart phones, home gateway devices, and other end user computing devices that
are connected or can connect to the public Internet and/or private IP
networks.</t>

        
        <t>Increasingly, other household systems and devices contain embedded
hosts that are connected to or can connect to the public Internet and/or
private IP networks. However, these devices may not be under interactive
control of the Internet user, such as may be the case with various smart home
and smart grid devices.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Malware">
        <t>Malware is short for "malicious software". In this case, malicious
bots are considered a subset of malware. Other forms of malware could include
viruses and other similar types of software. Internet users can sometimes cause
their hosts to be infected with malware, which may include a bot or cause a bot
to install itself, via inadvertently accessing a specific web site, downloading a file, or other activities.</t>
        
        <t>In other cases, Internet-connected hosts may become infected with malware through externally initiated malicious activities such as the exploitation of vulnerabilities or the brute force guessing of access credentials.</t>
        
      </section>
      
      <section title="Fast Flux" anchor="fastflux">
        <t>Domain Name System (DNS) fast fluxing occurs when a domain is bound in DNS using A records to multiple IP addresses, each of which has a very short Time-to-Live (TTL) value associated with it. This means that the domain resolves to varying IP addresses over a short period of time.</t>

		<t>DNS fast flux is typically used in conjunction with proxies
that are normally run on compromised user hosts. These proxies route the web
requests to the real host, which serves the data being sought. The effect of this
is to make the detection of the real host much more difficult and to ensure
that the backend or hidden site remains up for as long as possible.</t>

        
      </section>
      
      
     </section>

    </section>
    
    <section anchor="problem" title="Problem Statement" toc="include">
      <t>Hosts used by Internet users, which in this case are customers of an
Internet Service Provider (ISP), can be infected with malware that may contain
and/or install one or more bots on a host. They can present a major problem for
an ISP for a number of reasons (not to mention, of course, the problems created
for users). First, these bots can be used to send spam, in some cases very
large volumes of spam <xref target="Spamalytics"/>. This spam can result in
extra cost for the ISPs in terms of wasted network, server, and/or personnel
resources, among many other potential costs and side effects. Such spam can
also negatively affect the reputation of the ISP, their customers, and the
email reputation of the IP address space used by the ISP (often referred to
simply as "IP reputation"). A further potential complication is that IP space
compromised by bad reputation may continue to carry this bad reputation even
when used for entirely innocent purposes following reassignment of that IP
space.</t>


      <t>In addition, these bots can act as platforms for directing,
participating in, or otherwise conducting attacks on critical Internet
infrastructure <xref target="Threat-Report"/>. Bots are frequently used as part
of coordinated DDoS attacks for criminal,
political, or other motivations <xref target="Gh0st"/><xref
target="Dragon"/><xref target="DDoS"/>. For example, bots have been used to
attack Internet
resources and infrastructure ranging from web sites to email servers and DNS
servers, as well as the critical Internet infrastructure of entire countries
<xref target="Estonia"/><xref target="Combat-Zone"/>. Motivations for such
coordinated DDoS attacks can range from criminal extortion attempts through to
online protesting and nationalistic fervor <xref target="Whiz-Kid"/>. DDoS
attacks may also be motivated by simple personal vendettas or by persons simply
seeking a cheap thrill at the expense of others.</t>

      
      <t>There is good evidence to suggest that bots are being used in the
corporate environment for purposes of corporate espionage including the
exfiltration of corporate financial data and intellectual property. This also
extends to the possibility of bots being used for state-sponsored purposes such
as espionage.</t>


      <t>While any computing device can be infected with bots, the majority of bot infections affect the personal computers used by Internet end users. As a result of the role of ISPs in providing IP connectivity, among many other services, to Internet users, these ISPs are in a unique position to be able to attempt to detect and observe botnets operating in their networks. Furthermore, ISPs may also be in a unique position to be able to notify their customers of actual, potential, or likely infection by bots or other infection.</t>
      
      <t>From the perspective of end users, being notified that they may have an
infected computer on their network is important information. Once they know
this, they can take steps to remove the bots, resolve any problems that may
stem from the bot infection, and protect themselves against future
threats. It is important to notify users that they may be infected with a
bot because bots can consume vast amounts of local computing and
network resources, enable theft of personal information (including personal
financial information), enable the host to be used for criminal activities
(that may result in the Internet user being legally culpable), and destroy or leave
the host in an unrecoverable state via "kill switch" bot technologies.</t>


      <t>As a result, the intent of this document is to provide guidance to
ISPs and other organizations for the remediation of hosts infected with bots,
so as to reduce the size of botnets and minimize the potential harm that bots
can inflict upon Internet infrastructure in general as well as on individual
Internet users. Efforts by ISPs and other organizations can, over time, reduce
the pool of hosts infected with bots on the Internet, which in turn could
result in smaller botnets with less capability for disruption.</t>
      
      <t>The potential mitigation of bots is accomplished through a process of detection, notification to Internet users, and remediation of bot infections with a variety of tools, as described later in this document.</t>
      
    </section>

    <section anchor="limitations" title="Important Notice of Limitations and Scope" toc="include">
      <t>The techniques described in this document in no way guarantee the
remediation of all bots. Bot removal is potentially a task requiring
specialized knowledge, skills, and tools; it may be beyond the ability of
average users. Attempts at bot removal may frequently be unsuccessful, or only
partially successful, leaving the user's system in an unstable and
unsatisfactory state or even in a state where it is still infected. Attempts at
bot removal can result in side effects ranging from a loss of data to partial
or complete loss of system usability.</t>


      <t>In general, the only way a user can be sure they have removed some of
today's increasingly sophisticated malware is by "nuking-and-paving" the
system: reformatting the drive, reinstalling the operating system and
applications (including all patches) from scratch, and then restoring user
files from a known clean backup. However, the introduction of persistent
memory-based malware may mean that, in some cases, this may not be enough and may
prove to be more than any end user can be reasonably expected to resolve <xref
target="BIOS"/>. Experienced users would have to re-flash or re-image
persistent memory sections or components of their hosts in order to remove
persistent memory-based malware. However, in some cases, not even
nuking-and-paving the system will solve the problem, which calls for hard
drive replacement and/or complete replacement of the host.</t>

      
      <t>Devices with embedded operating systems, such as video gaming consoles
and smart home appliances, will most likely be beyond a user's capability to
remediate by themselves and could therefore require the aid of vendor-specific
advice, updates, and tools. However, in some cases, such devices will have a
function or switch to enable the user to reset that device to a factory default
configuration, which may sometimes enable the user to remediate the
infection. Care should be taken when imparting remediation advice to Internet
users given the increasingly wide array of computing devices that can be, or
could be, infected by bots in the future.</t>

      
      <t>This document is not intended to address the issues relating to the
prevention of bots on an end user device. This is out of the scope of this
document.</t>

            
     </section>


      <section anchor="Detection" title="Detection of Bots" toc="include">
        <t>An ISP must first identify that an Internet user is infected or
likely to have been infected with a bot (a user
is assumed to be their customer or otherwise connected to the
ISP's network). The ISP
should attempt to detect the presence of bots using methods, processes, and
tools that maintain the privacy of the personally identifiable information
(PII) of their customers. The ISP should not block legitimate traffic in the
course of bot detection and should instead employ detection methods, tools,
and processes that seek to be non-disruptive and transparent to Internet users
and end user applications.</t>


        <t>Detection methods, tools, and processes may include analysis of
specific network and/or application traffic flows (such as traffic to an email
server), analysis of aggregate network and/or application traffic data, data
feeds received from other ISPs and organizations (such as lists of the ISP's IP
addresses that have been reported to have sent spam), feedback from the ISP's
customers or other Internet users, as well as a wide variety of other
possibilities. In practice, it has proven effective to confirm a bot infection
through the use of a combination of multiple bot detection data points. This
can help to corroborate information of varying dependability or consistency, as
well as to avoid or minimize the possibility of false positive identification
of hosts. Detection should also, where possible and feasible, attempt to
classify the specific bot infection type in order to confirm that it is
malicious in nature, estimate the variety and severity of threats it may pose
(such as spam bot, key-logging bot, file distribution bot, etc.), and
determine potential methods for eventual remediation. However, given the
dynamic nature of botnet management and the criminal incentives to seek quick
financial rewards, botnets frequently update or change their core
capabilities. As a consequence, botnets that are initially detected and
classified by the ISP as made up of one particular type of bot need to be
continuously monitored and tracked in order to correctly identify the threat
the botnet poses at any particular point in time.</t>

        <t>Detection is also time sensitive. If complex analysis is required
and multiple confirmations are needed to verify a bot is indeed present, then
it is possible that the bot may cause some damage (to either the infected host
or a remotely targeted system) before it can be stopped. This means that an ISP
needs to balance the desire or need to definitively classify and/or confirm the
presence of a bot, which may take an extended period of time, with the ability
to predict the likelihood of a bot in a very short period of time. Such
determinations must have a relatively low false positive rate in order to
maintain the trust of users. This "definitive-versus-likely" challenge is difficult
and, when in doubt, ISPs should err on the side of caution by communicating
that a bot infection has taken place. This also means that Internet users may
benefit from the installation of client-based security software on their
host. This can enable rapid heuristically based detection of bot activity, such
as the detection of a bot as it starts to communicate with other botnets and
execute commands. Any bot detection system should also be capable of adapting,
either via manual intervention or automatically, in order to cope with a
rapidly evolving threat.</t>


       <t>As noted above, detection methods, tools, and processes should ensure
that privacy of customers' personally identifiable information (PII) is
maintained. This protection afforded to PII should also extend to third parties
processing data on behalf of ISPs. While bot detection methods, tools, and
processes are similar to spam and virus defenses deployed by the ISP for the
benefit of their customers (and may be directly related to those defenses),
attempts to detect bots should take into account the need of an ISP to take
care to ensure any PII collected or incidentally detected is properly
protected. This is important because just as spam defenses may involve scanning the
content of email messages, which may contain PII, then so too may bot defenses
similarly come into incidental contact with PII. The definition of PII varies
from one jurisdiction to the next so proper care should be taken to ensure that
any actions taken comply with legislation and good practice in the jurisdiction
in which the PII is gathered. Finally, depending upon the geographic region
within which an ISP operates, certain methods relating to bot detection may
need to be included in relevant terms of service documents or other documents
that are available to the customers of a particular ISP.</t>


        <t>There are several bot detection methods, tools, and processes that
an ISP may choose to utilize, as noted in the list below. It is important to
note that the technical solutions available are relatively immature and are
likely to change over time, evolving rapidly in the coming years. While these
items are described in relation to ISPs, they may also be applicable to
organizations operating other networks, such as campus networks and enterprise
networks.</t>


        <t><list style="letters"> 
        	<t>Where it is not legally proscribed and an accepted industry
practice in a particular market region, an ISP may in some manner "scan" its IP
space in order to detect un-patched or otherwise vulnerable hosts or to detect
the signs of infection. This may provide the ISP with the opportunity to easily
identify Internet users who appear already to be infected or are at great risk
of being infected with a bot. ISPs should note that some types of port scanning
may leave network services in a hung state or render them unusable due to
common frailties and that many modern firewall and host-based
intrusion detection 
implementations may alert the Internet user to the scan. As a result,
the scan may be interpreted as a malicious attack against the
host. Vulnerability scanning has a higher probability of leaving accessible
network services and applications in a damaged state and will often result in a
higher probability of detection by the Internet user and subsequent
interpretation as a targeted attack. Depending upon the vulnerability for which
an ISP may be scanning, some automated methods of vulnerability checking may
result in data being altered or created afresh on the Internet user's host,
which can be a problem in many legal environments. It should also be noted that
due to the prevalence of Network Address Translation devices, Port Address
Translation devices, and/or firewall devices in user networks, network-based
vulnerability scanning may be of limited value. Thus, while we note that this
is one technique that may be utilized, it is unlikely to be particularly
effective and has problematic side effects, which leads the authors to
recommend against the use of this particular method.</t>

        
        	<t>An ISP may also communicate and share selected data, via
feedback loops or other mechanisms, with various third parties. Feedback loops
are consistently formatted feeds of real-time (or nearly real-time) abuse
reports offered by threat data clearinghouses, security alert organizations,
other ISPs, and other organizations. The formats for feedback loops include
those defined in both the Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) <xref target="RFC5965"/>
and the
Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) <xref
target="RFC5070"/>. The data may include, but is not limited to, IP addresses
of hosts that appear to be either definitely or probably infected, IP
addresses, domain names or fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) known to host
malware and/or be involved in the command and control of botnets, recently
tested or discovered techniques for detecting or remediating bot infections,
new threat vectors, and other relevant information. A few good examples of data
sharing are noted in <xref
target="Examples_of_Third_Party_Malware_Lists"/>.</t>

        
        	<t>An ISP may use Netflow <xref target="RFC3954"/> or other
similar passive network monitoring to identify network anomalies that may be
indicative of botnet attacks or bot communications. For example, an ISP may be
able to identify compromised hosts by identifying traffic destined to IP
addresses associated with the command and control of botnets or destined to
the combination of an IP address and control port associated with a command and
control network (sometimes command and control traffic comes from a host that
has legitimate traffic). In addition, bots may be identified when a remote host
is under a DDoS attack, because hosts participating in the attack will likely
be infected by a bot. This can often be observed at network borders although ISPs
should beware of source IP address spoofing techniques that may be employed to avoid or confuse
detection.</t>

        
       	 	<t>An ISP may use DNS-based techniques to perform
detection. For example, a given classified bot may be known to query a specific
list of domain names at specific times or on specific dates (in the example of
the so-called "Conficker" bot (see <xref target="Conficker"/>), often by
matching DNS queries to a well-known list of domains associated with
malware. In many cases, such lists are distributed by or shared using third
parties, such as threat data clearinghouses.</t>

        
        	<t>Because hosts infected by bots are
frequently used to send spam or participate in DDoS attacks, the ISP servicing
those hosts will normally receive complaints about the malicious network
traffic. Those complaints may be sent to role accounts specified in RFC 2142 <xref
target="RFC2142"/>, such as abuse@, or to other relevant
addresses such as to abuse or security addresses specified by the site as part
of its WHOIS (or other) contact data.</t>

        
        	<t>ISPs may also discover likely bot-infected hosts located on
other networks. Thus, when legally permissible in a particular market region,
it may be worthwhile for ISPs to share information relating to those
compromised hosts with the relevant remote network operator, security
researchers, and blocklist operators.</t> 

 
        	<t>ISPs may operate or subscribe to services that provide
"sinkholing" or "honeynet" capabilities. This may enable the ISP to obtain
near-real-time lists of bot-infected hosts as they attempt to join a larger
botnet or propagate to other hosts on a network.</t>

        
        	<t>ISP industry associations should examine the possibility of collating statistics from ISP members in order to provide good statistics about bot infections based on real ISP data.</t>
        
        	<t>An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be a useful tool to actually help identify the malware. An IDS tool such as Snort (open source IDS platform; see <xref target="Snort"/>) can be placed in a walled garden and used to analyze end user traffic to confirm malware type. This will help with remediation of the infected device.</t>
        
        </list></t>
      
      </section>

      <section anchor="Notification" title="Notification to Internet Users" toc="include">
        <t>Once an ISP has detected a bot, or the strong likelihood of a bot,
steps should be undertaken to inform the Internet user that they may have a
bot-related problem. An ISP should decide the most
appropriate method or methods for providing notification to one or more of
their customers or Internet users, depending upon a range of factors including the technical
capabilities of the ISP, the technical attributes of its network, financial
considerations, available server resources, available organizational resources,
the number of likely infected hosts detected at any given time, and the severity
of any possible threats. Such notification methods may include one or
more of the methods described in the following subsections, as well as other
possible methods not described below.</t>

        
        <t>It is important to note that none of these methods are guaranteed to
be one hundred percent successful and that each has its own set of
limitations. In addition, in some cases, an ISP may determine that a
combination of two or more methods is most appropriate and effective and
reduces the chance that malware may block a notification. As such, the authors
recommend the use of multiple notification methods. Finally, notification is
also considered time sensitive; if the user does not receive or view the
notification in a timely fashion, then a particular bot could launch an attack,
exploit the user, or cause other harm. If possible, an ISP should establish a
preferred means of communication when the subscriber first signs up for
service. As a part of the notification process, ISPs should maintain a record
of the allocation of IP addresses to subscribers for a period long enough
to allow any commonly used bot detection technology to be able to accurately
link an infected IP address to a subscriber. This record should only be
maintained for a period of time that is necessary to support bot detection, but
no longer, in order to protect the privacy of the individual subscriber.</t>

         
        <t>One important factor to bear in mind is that notification to end
users needs to be resistant to potential spoofing. This should be done to
protect, as reasonably as possible, against the potential of legitimate
notifications being spoofed and/or used by parties with intent to perform
additional malicious attacks against victims of malware or even to deliver
additional malware.</t>

        
        <t>It should be possible for the end user to indicate the preferred means of notification on an opt-in basis for that notification method. It is recommended that the end user should not be allowed to opt out of notification entirely.</t>
        
        <t>When users are notified, an ISP should endeavor to give as much
information as possible to the end user regarding which bot detection methods
are employed at
the ISP, consonant with not providing information to those creating or deploying
the bots so that they would be able to avoid detection.</t>


        <section anchor="Email_Notification" title="Email Notification">
          <t>This is a common form of notification used by ISPs. One drawback
of using email is that it is not guaranteed to be viewed within a reasonable
time frame, if at all. The user may be using a different primary email address
than the one they provided to the ISP. In addition, some ISPs do not
provide an email account at all as part of a bundle of Internet services
and/or do not have a need for or method by which to request or retain the
primary email addresses of Internet users of their networks. Another
possibility is that the user, their email client, and/or their email servers
could determine or classify such a notification as spam, which could delete the
message or otherwise file it in an email folder that the user may not check on
a regular and/or timely basis. Bot masters have also been known to impersonate
the ISP or trusted sender and send fraudulent emails to the users. This
technique of social engineering often leads to new bot infestations. Finally, if
the user's email credentials are compromised, then a hacker and/or a bot could
simply access the user's email account and delete the email before it is read
by the user.</t>

        <section anchor="Telephone_Call_Notification" title="Telephone Call Notification">
          <t>A telephone call may be an effective means of communication in
particularly high-risk situations. However, telephone calls may not be feasible
due to the cost of making a large number of calls, as measured in either time,
money, organizational resources, server resources, or some other means. In
addition, there is no guarantee that the user will answer their phone. To the
extent that the telephone number called by the ISP can be answered by the
infected computing device, the bot on that host may be able to disconnect,
divert, or otherwise interfere with an incoming call. Users may also interpret
such a telephone notification as a telemarketing call and therefore not welcome
it or not accept the call at all. Finally, even if a representative of the ISP
is able to connect with and speak to a user, that user is very likely to lack
the necessary technical expertise to understand or be able to effectively deal
with the threat.</t>

        </section>

        <section anchor="Postal_Mail_Notification" title="Postal Mail Notification">
          <t>This form of notification is probably the least popular and effective means of communication, due to preparation time, delivery time, the cost of printing and paper, and the cost of postage.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="Walled_Garden_Notification" title="Walled Garden Notification">
          <t>Placing a user in a walled garden is another approach that ISPs
may take to notify users. A "walled garden" refers to an environment that
controls the information and services that a subscriber is allowed to utilize
and what network access permissions are granted. A walled garden implementation
can range from strict to leaky. In a strict walled garden environment, access
to most Internet resources is typically limited by the ISP.  In contrast, a
leaky walled garden environment permits access to all Internet resources,
except those deemed malicious, and ensures access to those that can be used to
notify users of infections.</t>


          <t>Walled gardens are effective because it is possible to notify the
user and simultaneously block all communication between the bot and the command
and control channel. While in many cases the user is almost guaranteed to view
the notification message and take any appropriate remediation actions, this
approach can pose other challenges. For example, it is not always the case that
a user is actively utilizing a host that implements a web browser, has a web
browser actively running on it, or operates another application that uses
ports that are redirected to the walled garden. 

In one example, a user could
be playing a game online, via the use of a dedicated, Internet-connected game
console. In another example, the user may not be using a host with a web
browser when they are placed in the walled garden and may instead be in the
course of a telephone conversation or may be expecting to receive a call
using a Voice over IP (VoIP) device of some type. As a result, the ISP may feel
the need to maintain a potentially lengthy white list of domains that are not
subject to the typical restrictions of a walled garden, which could well prove
to be an onerous task from an operational perspective. </t>


		  <t>For these reasons, the implementation of a leaky walled
garden makes more sense, but a leaky walled garden has a different set of
drawbacks. The ISP has to assume that the user will eventually use a web
browser to acknowledge the notification; otherwise, the user will remain in the
walled garden and not know it. If the intent of the leaky walled garden is
solely to notify the user about the bot infection, then the leaky walled garden
is not ideal because notification is time sensitive, and the user may not
receive the notification until the user invokes a request for the targeted
service and/or resource. This means the bot can potentially do more
damage. Additionally, the ISP has to identify which services and/or resources
to restrict for the purposes of notification. This does not have to be resource
specific and can be time based and/or policy based. An example of how
notification could be made on a timed basis could involve notification for all
HTTP requests every 10 minutes, or show the notification for one in five HTTP
requests.</t>


          <t>The ISP has several options to determine when to let the user out
of the walled garden. One approach may be to let the user determine when to
exit. This option is suggested when the primary purpose of the walled garden is
to notify users and provide information on remediation only, particularly since
notification is not a guarantee of successful remediation. It could also be the
case that, for whatever reason, the user makes the judgment that they cannot
then take the time to remediate their host and that other online activities
that they would like to resume are more important. Exit from the walled garden
may also involve a process to verify that it is indeed the user who is
requesting exit from the walled garden and not the bot.</t>


          <t>Once the user acknowledges the notification, they may decide 
either to remediate and exit the walled garden or to exit the walled garden
without remediating the issue. Another approach may be to enforce a stricter
policy and require the user to clean the host prior to permitting the user to
exit the walled garden, though this may not be technically feasible depending
upon the type of bot, obfuscation techniques employed by a bot, and/or a range
of other factors. Thus, the ISP may also need to support tools to scan the
infected host (in the style of a virus scan, rather than a port scan) and
determine whether it is still infected or rely on user judgment that the bot
has been disabled or removed. One challenge with this approach is that the user
might have multiple hosts sharing a single IP address, such as via a common
home gateway device that performs Network Address Translation (NAT). In such a
case, the ISP may need to determine from user feedback, or other means, that
all affected hosts have been remediated, which may or may not be technically
feasible.</t>

          
          <t>Finally, when a walled garden is used, a list of well-known
addresses for both operating system vendors and security vendors should be
created and maintained in a white list that permits access to these
sites. This can be important for allowing access from the walled garden by end
users in search of operating system and application patches. It is recommended
that walled gardens be seriously considered as a method of notification as they
are easy to implement and proven to be effective as a means of getting end user
attention.</t>

        <section anchor="Instant_Message_Notification" title="Instant Message Notification">
          
          <t>IM provides the ISP with a simple means to communicate with the user. There are several advantages to using IM that make it an attractive option. If the ISP provides IM service and the user subscribes to it, then the user can be notified easily. IM-based notification can be a cost-effective means to communicate with users automatically from an IM alert system or by a manual process, involving the ISP's support staff. Ideally, the ISP should allow the user to register their IM identity in an ISP account management system and grant permission to be contacted via this means. If the IM service provider supports off-line messaging, then the user can be notified regardless of whether they are currently logged into the IM system.</t>
          
          <t>There are several drawbacks with this communications method. There
is a high probability that a subscriber may interpret the communication to be
spim and thus ignore it. Also, not every user uses IM and/or the user may
not provide their IM identity to the ISP so some alternative means have to be
used. Even in those cases where a user does have an IM address, they may not be
signed onto that IM system when the notification is attempted. There may be a
privacy concern on the part of users when such an IM notification must be
transmitted over a third-party network and/or IM service. As such, should this
method be used, the notification should be discreet and not include any PII in
the notification itself.</t>

          
        </section>

        <section anchor="Short_Message_Service_SMS_Notification" title="Short Message Service (SMS) Notification">
          <t>SMS allows the ISP to send a brief description of the problem to notify the user of the issue, typically to a mobile device such as a mobile phone or smart phone. Ideally, the ISP should allow the user to register their mobile number and/or SMS address in an ISP account management system and grant permission to be contacted via this means. The primary advantage of SMS is that users are familiar with receiving text messages and are likely to read them. However, users may not act on the notification immediately if they are not in front of their host at the time of the SMS notification.</t> 
          
          <t>One disadvantage is that ISPs may have to follow up with an alternate means of notification if not all of the necessary information may be conveyed in one message, given constraints on the number of characters in an individual message (typically 140 characters). Another disadvantage with SMS is the cost associated with it. The ISP has to either build its own SMS gateway to interface with the various wireless network service providers or use a third-party SMS clearinghouse (relay) to notify users. In both cases, an ISP may incur fees related to SMS notifications, depending upon the method used to send the notifications. An additional downside is that SMS messages sent to a user may result in a charge to the user by their wireless provider, depending upon the plan to which they subscribe and the country in which the user resides. Another minor disadvantage is that it is possible to notify the wrong user if the intended user changes their mobile number but forgets to update it with the ISP.</t>        
          
         <t>There are several other drawbacks with this communications
method. There is a high probability that subscriber may interpret the
communication to be spam and thus ignore it. Also, not every user uses SMS,
and/or the user may not provide their SMS address or mobile number to the
ISP. Even in those cases where a user does have an SMS address or mobile
number, their device may not be powered on or otherwise available on a wireless
network when the notification is attempted. There may also be a privacy
concern on the part of users when such an SMS notification must be transmitted
over a third-party network and/or SMS clearinghouse. As such, should this
method be used, the notification should be discreet and not include any PII in
the notification itself.</t>

        <section anchor="Web_Browser_Notification" title="Web Browser Notification"> 
        
        <t>Near-real-time notification to the user's web browser is another
technique that may be utilized for notifying the user <xref target="RFC6108"/>,
though how such a system might operate is outside the scope of this
document. Such a notification could have a comparative advantage over a walled
garden notification, in that it does not restrict traffic to a specified list
of destinations in the same way that a walled garden would, by definition. However, as with a walled garden notification, there is no guarantee
that a user is making use of a web browser at any given time, though such a
system could certainly provide a notification when such a browser is eventually
used. Compared to a walled garden, a web browser notification is probably
preferred from the perspective of Internet users, as it does not have the risk
of disrupting non-web sessions, such as online games, VoIP calls, etc. (as
noted in <xref target="Walled_Garden_Notification"/>).</t>

        
        <t>There are alternative methods of web browser notification offered
commercially by a number of vendors. Many of the techniques used are
proprietary, and it is not within the scope of this document to describe how
they are implemented. These techniques have been successfully implemented at
several ISPs.</t>

        <section anchor="Public_Network_Notification" title="Considerations for Notification to Public Network Locations">
        
        <t>Delivering a notification to a location that provides a shared
public network, such as a train station, public square, coffee shop, or similar
location may be of low value since the users connecting to such networks are
typically highly transient and generally not known to site or network
administrators. For example, a system may detect that a host on such a network
has a bot, but by the time a notification is generated, that user has departed
from the network and moved elsewhere.</t>

        </section>
        
        <section anchor="Shared_Address_Network_Notification" title="Considerations for Notification to Network Locations Using a Shared IP Address">
        
        <t>Delivering a notification to a location that accesses the Internet routed through one or more shared public IP addresses may be of low value since it may be quite difficult to differentiate between users when providing a notification. For example, on a business network of 500 users, all sharing one public IP address, it may be sub-optimal to provide a notification to all 500 users if you only need one specific user to be notified and take action. As a result, such networks may find value in establishing a localized bot detection and notification system, just as they are likely to also establish other localized systems for security, file sharing, email, and so on.</t>
        
        <t>However, should an ISP implement some form of notification to such
networks, it may be better to simply send notifications to a designated network
administrator at the site. In such a case, the local network administrator may
like to receive additional information in such a notification, such as a date
and timestamp, the source port of the infected system, and malicious sites and
ports that may have been visited.</t>

        <t>The ultimate effectiveness of any of the aforementioned forms of notification is heavily dependent upon both the expertise of the end user and the wording of any such notification. For example, while a user may receive and acknowledge a notification, that user may lack the necessary technical expertise to understand or be able to deal effectively with the threat. As a result, it is important that such notifications use clear and easily understood language, so that the majority of users (who are non-technical) may understand the notification. In addition, a notification should provide easily understood guidance on how to remediate a threat as described in <xref target="Remediation"/>, potentially with one path for technical users to take and another for non-technical users.</t>

      <section anchor="Remediation" title="Remediation of Hosts Infected with a Bot" toc="include">
        <t>This section covers the different options available to remediate a host, which means to remove, disable, or otherwise render a bot harmless. Prior to this step, an ISP has detected the bot, notified the user that one of their hosts is infected with a bot, and now may provide some recommended means to clean the host. The generally recommended approach is to provide the necessary tools and education to the user so that they may perform bot remediation themselves, particularly given the risks and difficulties inherent in attempting to remove a bot.</t>
        
        <t>For example, this may include the creation of a special web site
with security-oriented content that is dedicated for this purpose. This should
be a well-publicized security web site to which a user with a bot infection can
be directed to for remediation. This security web site should clearly explain
why the user was notified and may include an explanation of what bots are and
the threats that they pose. There should be a clear explanation of the steps
that the user should take in order to attempt to clean their host and
information on how users can keep the host free of future infections. The
security web site should also have a guided process that takes non-technical
users through the remediation process, on an easily understood, step-by-step
basis.</t>


        <t>In terms of the text used to explain what bots are and the threats that they pose, something simple such as this may suffice:</t>

		<t><list>
        	<t>What is a bot? A bot is a piece of software, generally
installed on your machine without your knowledge, which either sends spam or
tries to steal your personal information. They can be very difficult to spot,
though you may have noticed that your computer is running much more slowly than
usual or you may notice regular disk activity even when you are not doing
anything. Ignoring this problem is risky to you and your personal
information. Thus, bots need to be removed to protect your data and your
personal information.</t> </list> </t>

	<t> Many bots are designed to work in a very stealthy manner, and as
such, there may be a need to make sure that the Internet user understands the
magnitude of the threat faced despite the stealthy nature of the bot.</t>

        
        <t>It is also important to note that it may not be immediately apparent
to the Internet user precisely which devices have been infected with a
particular bot. This may be due to the user's home network configuration, which
may encompass several hosts, where a home gateway that performs Network Address
Translation (NAT) to share a single public IP address has been used. Therefore,
any of these devices can be infected with a bot. The consequence of this for an
ISP is that remediation advice may not ultimately be immediately actionable by
the Internet user, as that user may need to perform additional investigation
within their own home network.</t>

        
         <t>An added complication is that the user may have a bot infection on
a device such as a video console, multimedia system, appliance, or other
end user computing device that does not have a typical desktop computing
interface. As a result, diligence needs to be taken by the ISP where possible
such that it can identify and communicate the specific nature of the device
that has been infected with a bot and provide further appropriate
remediation advice. If the ISP cannot pin down the device or identify its type,
then it should make it clear to the user that any initial advice given is
generic and further advice can be given (or is available) once the type of
infected device is known.</t>

         
         <t>There are a number of forums that exist online to provide
security-related support to end users. These forums are staffed by volunteers and often
are focused around the use of a common tool set to help end users to remediate
hosts infected with malware. It may be advantageous to ISPs to foster a
relationship with one or more forums, perhaps by offering free hosting or other
forms of sponsorship.</t>

         
         <t>It is also important to keep in mind that not all users will be
technically adept, as noted in <xref
target="Notification_and_End_User_Expertise"/>. As a result, it may be more
effective to provide a range of suggestion options for remediation. This may
include, for example, a very detailed "do it yourself" approach for experts, a
simpler guided process for the average user, and even assisted remediation as
described in  <xref target="Professionally_Assisted_Remediation_Process"/>.</t>


      <section title="Guided Remediation Process" anchor="Guided_Remediation_Process" toc="include">
        <t>Minimally, the Guided Remediation Process should include the following goals, with options and/or recommendations for achieving them:
        
        <list style="numbers"> 
        	<t>Back up personal files. For example: <list style="empty">
<t>Before you start, make
sure to back up all of your important data. (You should do this on a regular
basis anyway.) You can back up your files manually or using a system backup
software utility, which may be part of your Operating System (OS). You can
back up your files to a USB Thumb Drive (aka USB Key), a writeable CD/DVD-ROM,
an external hard drive, a network file server, or an Internet-based backup
service.</t></list> It may be advisable to suggest that the user backup is performed onto
separate backup media or devices if they suspect bot infection.</t>

        
 			<t>Download OS patches and Anti-Virus (A/V) software
updates. For example, links could be provided to Microsoft Windows updates,
Apple Mac OS updates, or other major operating systems that are
relevant to users and their devices.</t>

 
 			<t>Configure the host to automatically install updates
for the OS, A/V, and other common web browsers such as Microsoft Internet
Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera, and Google Chrome.</t>

 
 			<t>Get professional assistance if they are unable to
remove the bots themselves. If purchasing professional assistance, then the
user should be encouraged to predetermine how much they are willing to pay for
that help. For example, if the host that is being remediated is old and can easily be
replaced with a new, faster, larger, and more reliable system for a certain
cost, then it makes no sense to spend more than that cost to fix the old
host. On the other hand, if the customer has a brand-new host, it might
make perfect sense to spend the money to attempt to remediate it.</t>

 
			<t>To continue, regardless of whether the user or a
knowledgeable technical assistant is working on remediating the host, the
first task should be to determine which of multiple potentially infected
machines may be the one that needs attention (in the common case of multiple
hosts in a home network). Sometimes, as in cases where there is only a single
directly attached host, or the user has been noticing problems with one of
their hosts, this can be easy. Other times, it may be more difficult, especially
if there are no clues as to which host is infected. If the user is behind a
home gateway/router, then the first task may be to ascertain which of the
machines is infected. In some cases, the user may have to check all machines to
identify the infected one.</t>

			
			<t>ISPs may also look at offering a CD/DVD with remediation processes and software in the event that a host is so badly infected as to be unable to communicate over the Internet.</t> 
 		
 			<t>User surveys to solicit feedback on whether the notification and remediation process is effective and what recommended changes could be made in order to improve the ease, understandability, and effectiveness the remediation process.</t>
 
 			<t>If the user is interested in reporting the
host's bot infection to an applicable law enforcement authority, then the host
effectively becomes a cyber "crime scene", and the infection should not be
mitigated unless or until law enforcement has collected the necessary
evidence. For individuals in this situation, the ISP may wish to provide links
to local, state, federal, or other relevant computer crime offices. (Note: Some
"minor" incidents, even if highly traumatic to the user, may not be
sufficiently serious for law enforcement to commit some of their limited
resources to an investigation.) In addition, individual regions may have other,
specialized computer crime organizations to which these incidents can be
reported. For example, in the United States, that organization is the Internet
Crime Complaint Center, at http://www.ic3.gov.</t>

 
 
 			<t>Users may also be interested in links to security expert forums, where other users can assist them.</t>

        <t>It should be acknowledged that, based on the current state of
remediation tools and the technical abilities of end users, that many users may
be unable to remediate on their own. As a result, it is recommended that users

telephone assistance for remediation, as well as working face to face with a
professional who has training and expertise in the removal of malware. It

to remediate. In such cases, ISPs may need to consider taking additional steps
to protect their network, other users and hosts on that network, and other
networks. Such steps may include a progression of actions up to and including
account termination. Refusal to remediate can be viewed as a business issue, and
as such, no technical recommendation is possible.</t>

      <section title="Sharing of Data from the User to the ISP" toc="include" anchor="Sharing_of_Data">
        <t>As an additional consideration, it may be useful to create a process
by which users could choose, at their option and with their express consent, to
share data regarding their bot infections with their ISP and/or another
authorized third party. Such third parties may include governmental entities
that aggregate threat data, such as the Internet Crime Complaint Center
referred to earlier in this document, academic institutions, and/or security
researchers. While in many cases the information shared with the user's ISP or
designated third parties will only be used for aggregated statistical analysis,
it is also possible that certain research needs may be best met with more
detailed data. Thus, any such data sharing from a user to the ISP or authorized
third party may contain some type of personally identifiable information,
either by design or inadvertently. As a result, any such data sharing should be
enabled on an opt-in basis, where users review and approve of the data being
shared and the parties with which it is to be shared, unless the ISP is already
required to share such data in order to comply with local laws and applicable
regulations.</t>

      <t>This document describes in detail the numerous security risks and
concerns relating to botnets. As such, it has been appropriate to include
specific information about security in each section above. This document
describes the security risks related to malicious bot infections themselves,
such as enabling identity theft, theft of authentication credentials, and the
use of a host to unwittingly participate in a DDoS attack, among many other
risks. Finally, the document also describes security risks that may relate to
the particular methods of communicating a notification to Internet users. Bot
networks and bot infections pose extremely serious security risks, so

In addition, regarding notifications as described in <xref

care should be taken to assure users that
notifications have been provided by a trustworthy site and/or party, so that
the notification is more difficult for phishers and/or malicious parties using
social engineering tactics to mimic. Otherwise, care should be taken to ensure
that the user has some level of trust
that the notification is valid and/or that the user has some way to verify via
some other mechanism or step that the notification is valid.

from the user to the ISP and/or authorized third parties should be done on an
opt-in basis. Additionally the ISP and or authorized third parties should
clearly state what data will be shared and with whom the data will be
shared.</t>


      <t>Lastly, as noted in other sections, there may be legal
requirements in particular legal jurisdictions concerning how long any
subscriber-related or other data is retained. An ISP operating in such
a jurisdiction should be aware of these requirements and should comply with them.</t>
