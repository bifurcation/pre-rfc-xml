This document updates the registration guidance provided in Section 4.2 of RFC
5031, which allows the registration of service URNs with the 'sos' service
type only for emergency services "that are offered widely and in different
countries". This document updates those instructions to allow such
registrations when, at the time of registration, those services are
offered in only one country.

			<t>				
				The advice to experts for registering
sub-services of the service URN with the 'sos' service type is provided in
Section 4.2 of RFC 5031 <xref target="RFC5031" pageno="false"
format="default"/> as follows: 
			
<list><t>
   The 'sos' service type describes emergency services requiring an
   immediate response, typically offered by various branches of the
   government or other public institutions.  Additional sub-services can
   be added after expert review and must be of general public interest
   and have a similar emergency nature.  The expert is designated by the
   ECRIT working group, its successor, or, in their absence, the IESG.
   The expert review should only approve emergency services that are
   offered widely and in different countries, with approximately the
   same caller expectation in terms of services rendered.  The 'sos'
   service is not meant to invoke general government, public
   information, counseling, or social services.
</t>
</list>

 
			</t>

			<t>
				Some existing emergency services are, at least
initially, offered in only one 
				country. Examples are the "Reporting spies" emergency service offered 
				in South Korea and the "GAULA (anti-kidnapping)" emergency service offered 
				in Colombia according to <xref target="WIKIPEDIA" />. Future emergency service might also initially be 
				introduced in only one country.
			</t>
			<t>
				The advice to experts of sub-services of the
service URN with the 'sos' service  type provided in RFC 5031 <xref
target="RFC5031" pageno="false" format="default"/> prevents the registration
of a sub-service of the service URN with the 'sos' service type for a service
that, at the time of registration, is offered in one country only. 
			</t>
			<t>
				This document updates the 2nd paragraph of Section 4.2 of RFC 5031 <xref target="RFC5031" 
				pageno="false" format="default"/>, in order to allow the registration of service URNs 
				with the 'sos' service type for emergency services that, at the time of registration, are 
				offered in one country only.

				<t>
					The 'sos' service type describes
emergency services requiring an immediate response, typically offered by
various branches of the government or other public institutions.  Additional
sub-services can be added after expert review. The expert is designated by the
ECRIT working group, its successor, or, in their absence, the IESG.
The designated expert should only approve services
that are to be used for emergency purposes, that are offered in at least one
country, that do not match the description of any existing service URN with the
'sos' service type, and where the service description and the URN are defined
as broadly as possible to encourage reuse. The 'sos' service is not meant to
invoke general government, public information, counseling, or social services.
