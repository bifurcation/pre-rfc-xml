      <t>This document defines a set of new properties for iCalendar data
      and extends the use of some existing properties to the entire
      iCalendar object.</t>

    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>The <xref target='RFC5545'>iCalendar</xref> data format is used to
      represent calendar data and is used with the <xref
      target='RFC5546'> iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability
      Protocol (iTIP) </xref> to handle scheduling operations between
      calendar users. iCalendar is in widespread use, and in accordance with
      provisions in that specification, extension elements have been added by
      various vendors to the data format in order to support and enhance
      capabilities. This specification collects a number of these ad hoc extensions and uses the new IANA registry capability defined in <xref target='RFC5545' /> to register standard variants with clearly defined definitions and semantics. In addition, some new elements are introduced for features that vendors have recently been requesting.</t>
    </section>
    <section title='Conventions Used in This Document'>
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target='RFC2119' />.</t>
      <t>The notation used in this memo is the ABNF notation of <xref target='RFC5234' /> as used by <xref target='RFC5545'>iCalendar</xref>. Any syntax elements shown below that are not explicitly defined in this specification come from <xref target='RFC5545'>iCalendar</xref>.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Backwards-Compatible Extension Properties">
      <t>iCalendar defines properties that can have different value types
      indicated by a "VALUE" parameter. The definition of a property specifies
      a "default" value type that is assumed to be used when no "VALUE"
      parameter is present. However, this poses a problem to the iCalendar
      parser/generator software that does not know about the default values
      for new properties. For example, if a new property "FOO" were defined
      with a default value type of URI and a URI value with a comma was
      used, an iCalendar generator not aware of this fact would likely treat
      the property value as "TEXT" and apply backslash escaping to the comma
      in the value, effectively making it an invalid URI value.</t>

      <t>To avoid this problem, this specification recommends that all
      properties not defined in <xref target="RFC5545"/> always include a
      "VALUE" parameter if the type is other than "TEXT". That is, in the
      example above, the "FOO" property would have a "VALUE=URI"
      parameter. This allows iCalendar parser/generator software to track the correct types of unknown properties.</t>
      <t>New properties defined in this specification use the term "no
      default" in the "Value Type" definition to indicate that the "VALUE"
      parameter has to be included.</t>

    </section>
    <section title="Modifications to Calendar Components">
      <t>This section details changes to the syntax defined in <xref
      target='RFC5545'>iCalendar</xref>. New elements are
      defined in subsequent sections.

      <section title="DESCRIPTION Property" anchor="description">
        <t>This specification modifies the definition of the "DESCRIPTION"
	property to allow it to be defined in an iCalendar object. 

The following additions are made to the definition of this property, originally specified in Section 3.8.1.5 of <xref target="RFC5545"/>. 
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Purpose:">This property specifies the description of the calendar.</t>
          <t hangText="Conformance:">This property can be specified multiple times in an iCalendar object. However, each property MUST represent the description of the calendar in a different language.</t>
          <t hangText="Description:">This property is used to specify a lengthy textual description of the iCalendar object that can be used by calendar user agents when describing the nature of the calendar data to a user. Whilst a calendar only has a single description, multiple language variants can be specified by including this property multiple times with different "LANGUAGE" parameter values on each.</t>

      </section>
      <section title="UID Property" anchor="uid">
        <t>This specification modifies the definition of the "UID" property to
	allow it to be defined in an iCalendar object. The following
additions are made to the definition of this property, originally specified in
Section 3.8.4.7 of <xref target="RFC5545"/>.

        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Purpose:">This property specifies the persistent,
	  globally unique identifier for the iCalendar object. This can be
	  used, for example, to identify duplicate calendar streams that a
	  client may have been given access to. It can be used in conjunction
	  with the "LAST-MODIFIED" property also specified on the "VCALENDAR"
	  object to identify the most recent version of a calendar.</t>

          <t hangText="Conformance:">This property can be specified once in an iCalendar object.</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>The description of the "UID" property in <xref target="RFC5545"/>
	contains some recommendations on how the value can be constructed. In
	particular, it suggests use of host names, IP addresses, and domain
	names to construct the value. However, this is no longer considered
	good practice, particularly from a security and privacy standpoint,
	since use of such values can leak key information about a calendar
	user or their client and network environment. This specification
	updates <xref target="RFC5545"/> by stating that "UID" values MUST NOT
	include any data that might identify a user, host, domain, or any
	other security- or privacy-sensitive information. It is RECOMMENDED
	that calendar user agents now generate "UID" values that are
	hex-encoded random Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) values as
	defined in Sections&nbsp;4.4 and 4.5 of <xref target="RFC4122"/>.</t>
            <t hangText="Example:">The following is an example of such a property value:

]]></artwork>
            </figure></t>
            <t>Additionally, if calendar user agents choose to use other forms
	    of opaque identifiers for the "UID" value, they MUST have a length
	    less than 255 octets and MUST conform to the "iana-token" ABNF
	    syntax defined in Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC5545"/>.</t>

        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Purpose:">This property may be used to convey a location where a more dynamic rendition of the calendar information can be found.</t>

    <section title='Security Considerations'>
      <t>Several of the new properties or parameters defined by this
      specification allow reference to "external" URIs. Care MUST be taken
      when accessing data at external URIs as malicious content could be
      present. Clients SHOULD ensure that suitable permission is granted by
      calendar users before such URIs are dereferenced.</t>

      <t> The "REFRESH-INTERVAL" property could be used by an attacker to make
      a client carry out rapid requests to the server hosting the calendar by
      specifying a very short duration (e.g., one second). This could lead to
      resource consumption on the client or server and to denial-of-service
      attacks against the server. Clients MUST ensure that they throttle
      requests to the server to a reasonable rate. In most cases, updating a
      public calendar once per day would suffice. If the "REFRESH-INTERVAL" is
      any less than that, clients SHOULD warn the calendar user and allow them
      to override it with a longer value.</t>

      <t>The "CONFERENCE" property can include a "FEATURE" property parameter
      with a "MODERATOR" value. In some cases, the access code used by the
      owner/initiator of a conference might be private to an individual, and
      clients and servers MUST ensure that such properties are not sent to
      attendees of a scheduled component.</t>

      <t>Both the "COLOR" and "IMAGE" properties are likely to be used by calendar users to express their own personal view of the calendar data. In addition, these properties could be used by attackers to produce a confusing display in a calendar user agent. When such properties are encountered in calendar data that has come from other calendar users (e.g., via a scheduling message, "public" calendar subscription etc.), it is advisable for the client to give the receiving calendar user the option to remove (or adjust) these properties as the data is imported into their calendar system.</t>
      <t>This specification changes the recommendations on how "UID" property values are constructed to minimize leaking any information that might be security sensitive.</t>
      <t>
        Security considerations in <xref target="RFC5545" /> and <xref target="RFC5546" /> MUST also be adhered to.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Privacy Considerations'>
      <t>Several of the new properties or parameters defined by this
      specification allow reference to "external" URIs. Access to those URIs
      could be tracked, leading to loss of privacy. Clients SHOULD ensure that
      suitable permission is granted by calendar users before such URIs are
      dereferenced. In particular, calendar publishers wishing to help protect
      the privacy of their subscribers MUST use <xref target='RFC7230'>HTTP
      with Transport Layer Security</xref> ("https:" URIs instead of "http:"
      URIs) for access to calendar data or ancillary data such as images.</t>

      <t>In general, for
      their own privacy protection, users have to rely on the privacy policies of any
      conferencing system being accessed via the "CONFERENCE" property. It is entirely possible for such systems
      to uniquely identify and log the activity and participation (or lack thereof) of
      calendar users in the conference. Calendar user agents SHOULD track
      which conferencing systems are used and warn users the first time a new
      one is about to be used. This is particularly important if the client
      automatically "dials in" to the conference when the event start time
      occurs.</t>

      <t>By giving different calendar users different values for the
      "REFRESH-INTERVAL" property, it is possible for a publisher of calendar
      data to uniquely identify each refresh from each calendar users'
      clients and thereby track user activity and IP address over
      time. To address this, clients SHOULD add or subtract some random amount
      of time from the published "REFRESH-INTERVAL" value when doing actual
      refreshes.</t>

      <t>This specification changes the recommendations on how "UID" property
      values are constructed to minimize leaking any information that might be
      privacy sensitive.</t>
        <t>Privacy considerations in <xref target="RFC5545" /> and <xref target="RFC5546" /> MUST also be adhered to.</t>
