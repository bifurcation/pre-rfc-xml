      <abstract>

	 <t>This document specifies protocol enhancements that allow Mobile IPv4
	    entities to send and receive explicit notification messages using a
	    Mobile IPv4 message type designed for this purpose.
	 </t>

      </abstract>

   </front>
   <middle>
      <section anchor="sect.intro" title="Introduction">

	 <t>In some situations, there is a need for Mobile IPv4 entities, 
	    such as the home agent (HA), foreign agent (FA) and mobile
	    node (MN) 
	    to send and receive asynchronous
	    notification messages during a mobility session.  In this context, 'Asynchronous messages' is used to mean messages that are not synchronous with
	    the Registration Request and Registration Reply messages of the base Mobile IP (MIP)
	    specification <xref target="RFC5944"/>. The base Mobile IP
	    specification does not have a provision for this.

	 </t>
	 <t>

	    In order to rectify that, this document defines a generic
notification message and a notification model that can
	    be used by Mobile IPv4 entities to send various notifications.
	    It also defines a corresponding acknowledgement message to make it
possible to ensure reliable 
	    delivery of notifications.  Only the following extensions may be present in
	    these new messages, as defined by this document:

	 </t>
	 <t>
	    <list>  
	       <t>  -  MN-HA Authentication Extension </t>
	       <t>  -  MN-FA Authentication Extension </t>
	       <t>  -  FA-HA Authentication Extension </t>
	       <t>  -  Message String Extension </t> 
	    </list>
	 </t>

	 <t>

	    The semantics of receiving a generic notification message with a
	    Message String Extension are null; i.e., it has no effect on the state
	    of a mobile node's existing registration.  See <xref target="sect.usage.examples"/>
	    for some application examples that motivate the new messages defined
	    in this document.

	 </t>

      <section anchor="sect.term" title="Terminology">

	 <t>It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terminology used
	    in <xref target="RFC4917"/> and <xref target="RFC5944"/>.  
	    In addition, this document frequently uses the following terms: </t>

	 <t>
	    <list style="hanging" hangIndent="10">
	       <t hangText="Notification Message"> <vspace blankLines="0"/>
            A message from a mobility agent to a an MN or other mobility
            agent, or from an MN to a mobility agent, to asynchronously
            notify it about an event that is relevant to the mobility
            service it is currently providing.
	       </t>

	       <t hangText="Generic Notification Message"> <vspace blankLines="0"/>
		  A Notification Message in the context of Mobile IPv4 with
		  a well-defined envelope format and extensibility, and with
		  certain limitations on how extensions may be defined and used,
		  but otherwise generally available for notification purposes
		  within the Mobile IPv4 protocol.  Abbreviated 'GNM' in this document.
	       </t>

	       <t hangText="Generic Notification Acknowledgement Message"> <vspace blankLines="0"/>
		  An acknowledgement of a received Generic Notification Message.

	 <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
	    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

	    target="RFC2119"/>.  </t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="sect.usage" title="Notification Message - Usage Scenarios">
	 <section anchor="sect.usage.examples" title="Notification Message - Examples">
	    <t>

	       The simplest usage scenario for a notification message is one
	       where the notification has no semantic meaning within the protocol;
	       it is only carrying a message that can be displayed to a user or
	       an operator (depending on which is the receiving entity -- see more
	       on this below, 
	       in <xref target="sect.scen.topology"/>).  Examples of such usage are
	       messages from operator to user about billing- or service-related
	       events ("You have used nearly all of your prepaid quota; there
	       are only XX MB left -- please purchase further service if you are
	       going to need it."; or "You have now used data transfer services
	       for the amount of $XXX since your last bill; this is above the
	       notification threshold for your account.") or messages about
	       service interruptions, and more.  These examples are all supported
	       by the use of the Mobile IPv4 Generic Notification Message together
	       with the Message String Extension, as defined in this document.

	    </t>
	    <t>

	       There are also other examples, which cannot be implemented solely
	       using the messages and extensions defined in this document.  Some
	       of these are described briefly below, and covered slightly more
	       extensively in <xref target="sect.future"/>.

	    </t>
	    <t>

	       One example of an application of an extended Generic Notification
	       Message is that during handover between CDMA 2000
	       1x EV-DO and Wireless LAN, the PPP resource on the CDMA side has to
	       be removed on the FA (Packet Data Serving Node) to avoid over-charging subscribers.
	       To address this, the Registration Revocation Message was defined in
	       <xref target="RFC3543"/>, but it would have been preferable to have
	       had it defined as a separate message (i.e., the Generic Notification
	       Message) with a Registration Revocation extension.

	    </t>
	    <t>

   Other applications are:
 
<list style="symbols">
   <t>HA switch-over (before the HA decides to go off-line, it would
      like to notify the MNs to register with another candidate HA),</t>

   <t>Network Mobility (NEMO) prefix changes (an MN is notified by the HA about NEMO
      prefix changes and service- or billing-related events; this is
      an operational requirement),</t>

   <t>load balancing (the HA wants to move some of the registered MNs to
      other HAs),</t>

   <t>service termination (due to end of prepaid time), and</t> 

   <t>service interruption (due to system maintenance).</t>
</list></t>

	 </section>

	 <section anchor="sect.scen.topology" title="Notification Message - Topology">
	    <t>
	       There are several scenarios where a mobility agent could 
	       initiate notification events.  Some of these are described in the following  
	       sections.

		  <t> In this case, the MN has registered with the home

		  <t> The notification mechanism as specified here does not support the
		     case of co-located Care-of Address (CoA) mode with registration through an FA

	    <section anchor="sect.fa2mn" title="Notification Message between a Foreign Agent and a Mobile Node">

	       <t>There are two cases where an FA may send notification

		  an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) node. (Notification messages between a AAA entity and the FA
		  could be based on RADIUS or Diameter, but this is out of scope for
		  this document.)  If the notification is initiated by an FA,
		  the FA may also need to notify the HA about the event.

      <section anchor="sect.message" title="Generic Notification Message and Considerations">

	 <t>This section describes in detail the Generic Notification Message (GNM),
	    Generic Notification Acknowledgement Message (GNAM), and some considerations
	    related to the handling of these messages in the MN, FA, and HA. </t>

	 <t>The MN and HA MUST maintain the following information:

	    <list>  
	       <t>  -  the IP source address of the Registration Request/Reply </t>
	       <t>  -  the IP destination address of the Registration Request/Reply </t>
	       <t>  -  the UDP source port of the Registration Request/Reply   </t>           
	       <t>  -  the UDP destination port of the Registration Request/Reply </t> 
	    </list>
	 </t> 
	 <t>The sending node always sends the GNM following the same
	    procedure for sending a Registration Request as in Section 3.3 of
	    <xref target="RFC5944"/>, and the receiving node follows the same procedure
	    for Registration Reply as in Section 3.4 of <xref target="RFC5944"/>
	    when sending GNAM.
	 </t>


	 <section anchor="sect.gnm.definition" title="Generic Notification Message">

	    <t>A GNM is sent by a mobility agent to
	       inform another mobility agent, or an MN, of MIP-related information
	       in the form of a Message String Extension <xref target="RFC4917"/>. 
	       These messages MUST use the same IP and UDP headers as any previous 
	       Registration Request (RRQ) or Reply (RRP) message to the same entity.
	       This would support NAT traversal and ensure the same security association
	       used for GNM/GNAM and RRQ/RRP.

	 <section title="Notification Retransmission" anchor="sect.gnm.retrans">
	    <t>If the "A" flag has been set during the GNM, but the sender
	       doesn't receive any GNAM within a reasonable time, then the 
	       GNM SHOULD be retransmitted.  When timestamps are used, a new notification 
	       Identification is chosen for each retransmission; thus, it counts as
	       a new GNM.  When
	       nonces are used, the unanswered GNM is retransmitted unchanged;
	       thus, the retransmission does not count as a new GNM (<xref target="sect.security.replay"/>).
	       In this way, a retransmission will not require the receiver
	       to re-synchronize with the sender by issuing another nonce in the
	       case in which the original GNM (rather than its
	       GNAM) was lost by the network.
	    </t>

	    <t>The maximum time until a new GNM is sent SHOULD be
	       no greater than the requested Lifetime of the last GNM.
	       The minimum value SHOULD be large enough to account for the size of
	       the messages, twice the round-trip time for transmission to the receiver,
	       and at least an additional 100 milliseconds to allow for
	       processing the messages before responding.  The round-trip time for
	       transmission to the receiver will be at least as large as the time
	       REQUIRED to transmit the messages at the link speed of the sender's
	       current point of attachment.  Some circuits add another 200
	       milliseconds of satellite delay in the total round-trip time to the
	       receiver.  The minimum time between GNMs MUST NOT
	       be less than 1 second.  Each successive retransmission timeout period
	       SHOULD be at least twice the previous period, as long as that is less
	       than the maximum as specified above.</t>

	    <t>It is possible that the MN MAY receive a GNM from an FA or HA.
	       Both in the case of FA-CoA and co-located CoA, the MN MAY reply

	    <section title="Receiving Generic Notification Messages">
<t>
  When the MN is using an FA-CoA and receives a notification message,
  if the "MD" value is 0, it means that the notification message came
  from the HA.  If the "MD" value is 4, the notification came from the
  FA.  If the MN is using a co-located CoA and receives a notification
  message, the "MD" value will be 0, indicating that the notification
  message came from the HA.
</t><t>
  The MN MUST check for the presence of an authorization-enabling
  extension and perform the indicated authentication.  Exactly one
  authorization-enabling extension MUST be present in the GNM.
</t><t>
  If this message came from an FA, then an MN-FA AE MUST be present.
  If no MN-FA AE is found, or if more than one MN-FA AE is found, or if
  the Authenticator is invalid, then the MN MUST reject the GNM and MAY
  send a GNAM to the FA with Code 195, including an Identification
  field computed in accordance with the rules specified in <xref target="sect.security.replay"/>.
  The MN MUST do no further processing with such a notification, though
  it SHOULD log the error as a security exception.
</t><t>
  If this notification message came from the HA, relayed by the FA, or
  if the MN is using a co-located CoA, then the MN-HA AE MUST be
  checked and the MN MUST check the Authenticator value in the
  Extension.  If no MN-HA AE is found, or if more than one MN-HA AE is
  found, or if the Authenticator is invalid, then the MN MUST reject
  the GNM and MAY send a GNAM to the initiator with Code 196, including
  an Identification field computed in accordance with the rules
  specified in <xref target="sect.security.replay"/>.  The MN MUST do no further processing with
  such a notification, though it SHOULD log the error as a security
  exception.
</t><t>
  The MN MUST check that the Identification field is correct using the
  context selected by the SPI within a mandatory authentication
  extension like the MN-FA AE or MN-HA AE.  See <xref target="sect.security.replay"/> for a
  description of how this is performed.  If incorrect, the MN MUST
  reject the GNM and MAY send a GNAM to the initiator with Code 197,
  including an Identification field computed in accordance with the
  rules specified in <xref target="sect.security.replay"/>.  The MN MUST do no further processing
  with such a notification, though it SHOULD log the error as a
  security exception.
</t><t>
  The MN MUST also check that the extensions present in the Generic
  Notification Message are permitted for use with the GNM.  If not, the
  MN MUST silently discard the message.  It MUST NOT do any further
  processing with such a notification, though it SHOULD log the error.
</t><t>
  If the MN accepts a GNM, then it will process it according to the
  specific rules for the extensions.  After that, the MN MAY reply to the
  originator with a GNAM with Code 0 based on the "A" flag in the GNM.

<t>
  There are a number of reasons why the MN might reject a notification,

  act on or display the notification, or otherwise being resource
  constrained, causing the use of Code value 194 (insufficient resources);

	    This document defines the Generic Notification Message used with
	    the Message String Extension <xref target="RFC4917"/>.
	 </t>

	 <t>
	    However, it is possible to define new notification-related extensions
	    for use with the Generic Notification Message, for cases where the
	    notification is intended to have a semantic content and is
	    intended for the HA, FA, or MN, rather than for the user.
	 </t>
	 
	 <section anchor="sect.future.examples" title="Examples of Possible Extensions">
	     <t>
		One example of such usage, which would have been defined in this document if
		it hadn't already been defined as a separate message, is the
		<xref target="RFC3543">Registration Revocation Message</xref>.  This is a
		message sent from the HA to the FA(s) or MN to notify the receiving node that
		a currently active registration is being revoked.  The use case for this
		is clearly laid out in <xref target="RFC3543"/>.
	     </t>

	     <t>
		Another example would be managed maintenance switch-over between HA instances,
		where an HA due to go down for maintenance could direct the MNs registered
		with it to re-register with another specified HA.  Such a
		message could also be used for managed load balancing.  There is currently no
		support for such forced switch-over in the Mobile IPv4 protocol.  
	     </t>

	     <t>
		Yet another example is when the prefix set handled by an MIPv4 NEMO <xref target="RFC5177"/>
		HA changes; to ensure proper routing, the mobile router needs to be
		notified about the change so that its internal routing rules may be
		updated.
	     </t>

	     <t>

		One final example is home network changes that require host configuration
		changes, for instance, a change of address for the DNS server
		or another network server. Again, this is a case where the HA would want
		to notify the MN of the change, so that service interruptions can be
		avoided.

	     </t>
	 </section>

	 <section anchor="sect.future.specification" title="Extension Specification">
	 <t>
	    In order to avoid making the MIPv4 Generic Notification Message a generic
	    protocol extension mechanism by which new protocol mechanisms could be
	    implemented without appropriate discussion and approval, any new extensions that are
	    to be used with the Generic Notification Message must be registered with
	    IANA, where registration is limited by the 'RFC Required' policy defined
	    in <xref target="RFC5226"/>.
	 </t>
	 <t>

	    If additional extensions are specified for use with the Generic Notification
	    Message, the practice exemplified in <xref target="RFC5944"/> and related
	    specifications should be followed.  Generally, it has not been necessary so
	    far to provide versioning support within individual extensions; in a few cases, it
	    has been necessary to define new extensions with new extension numbers where
	    a generalization of a pre-existing extension has been
	    needed. With the
	    current rate of extension number consumption, that seems to be an acceptable
	    approach.

	 </t>
	 <t>

	    If at some point extensions are specified for use with the Generic Notification
	    Message that overlap with pre-existing notification messages, the authors of the
	    specification should consider providing a method to flag which notification messages
	    are supported, and which notification message usage is requested, in a manner
	    similar to the way tunneling method capabilities and usage requests are flagged in
	    the <xref target="RFC5944">Mobile IPv4 base specification</xref>.

	 </t>
	 <t>

	    Encoded in the extension number of Mobile IPv4 extensions is the notion of
	    'skippable' and 'not skippable' extensions; see Section 1.8 of <xref
	    target="RFC5944"/>.  This notion is also applicable when extensions are used with
	    the Generic Notification Message:  It is not required that a receiver understand a
	    skippable extension, but a non-skippable extension needs to be handled according to
	    Section 1.8 of <xref target="RFC5944"/> (i.e., the message must be silently
	    discarded if the extension is not recognized).  This document does not specify
	    any change from the <xref target="RFC5944">Mobile IPv4 base specification</xref>
	    in this respect.

	       verify that a GNM has been freshly generated by the sending node,
	       not replayed by an attacker from some previous notification.  Two
	       methods are described in this section:  timestamps (REQUIRED) and
	       "nonces" (OPTIONAL).  All senders and receivers MUST implement
	       timestamp-based replay protection.  These nodes MAY also implement
	       nonce-based replay protection </t>

	    <t>The style of replay protection in effect between any two peer nodes
	       among the MN, FA, and HA is part of the mobile security association.
	       A sending node and its receiving node MUST agree 
	       on which method of replay protection will be used.  The interpretation 
	       of the Identification field depends on the method of replay protection 
	       as described in the subsequent subsections.</t>

	    <t>Whatever method is used, the low-order 32 bits of the
Identification field
	       MUST be copied unchanged 
	       from the GNM to the GNAM.  The receiver uses those bits (and the sender's 
	       source address) to match the GNAM with corresponding replies.
	       The receiver MUST verify that the low-order 32 bits of any GNAM
Identification field
	       are identical to the bits it sent in the GNM.</t>

	    <t>The Identification in a new GNM MUST NOT be the same as in an immediately
	       preceding GNM, and SHOULD NOT repeat while the same security context is being
	       used between the MN and the HA.</t>

	    <section anchor="sect.security.replay.timestamps" title="Replay Protection Using Timestamps">

	       <t>The basic principle of timestamp replay protection is that the node
		  generating a message inserts the current time of day, and the node
		  receiving the message checks that this timestamp is sufficiently
		  close to its own time of day.  Unless specified differently in the
		  security association between the nodes, a default value of 7 seconds
		  MAY be used to limit the time difference.  This value SHOULD be
		  greater than 3 seconds.  Obviously, the two nodes must have adequately
		  synchronized time-of-day clocks.  As with any messages, time
		  synchronization messages may be protected against tampering by an
		  authentication mechanism determined by the security context between
		  the two nodes.</t>

	       <t>In this document, the timestamps are used, and the sender MUST set the 
		  Identification field to a 64-bit value formatted as specified by the 
		  Network Time Protocol (NTP) <xref target="RFC5905"/>.  The low-order 32 bits 
		  of the NTP format represent fractional seconds.
		  Note, however, that when using timestamps, the 
		  64-bit Identification used in a GNM from the sender MUST be 
		  greater than that used in any previous GNM, as the receiver
		  uses this field also as a sequence number.  Without such a
		  sequence number, it would be possible for a delayed duplicate of an
		  earlier GNM to arrive at the receiver (within the
		  clock synchronization required by the receiver), and thus be
		  applied out of order, mistakenly altering the sender's current status.</t>

	       <t>Upon receipt of a GNM with an authorization-enabling
		  extension, the receiver MUST check the Identification field for
		  validity.  In order to be valid, the timestamp contained in the
		  Identification field MUST be close enough to the receiver's time-of-day
		 clock and the timestamp MUST be greater than all previously
		  accepted timestamps for the requesting sender.  Time tolerances
		  and re-synchronization details are specific to a particular mobility
		  security association.</t>

	       <t>If the timestamp is valid, the receiver copies the entire
		  Identification field into the GNAM, and it returns the GNAM
		  to the sender.  If the timestamp is not valid, the receiver
		  copies only the low-order 32 bits into the GNAM, and
		  supplies the high-order 32 bits from its own time of day.  In this
		  latter case, the receiver MUST reject the notification by returning
		  Code 69, 133, or 197 (notification Identification mismatch) in the GNAM.</t>

	       <t>Furthermore, the receiver MUST verify that the low-order 32 bits of
		  the Identification in the GNAM are identical to those in the rejected 
		  GNM attempt, before using the high-order bits for clock re-synchronization.</t>

	    <section anchor="sect.security.replay.nonces" title="Replay Protection Using Nonces">
	       <t>The basic principle of nonce replay protection is that node A
		  includes a new random number in every message to node B, and checks
		  that node B returns that same number in its next message to node A.
		  Both messages use an authentication code to protect against
		  alteration by an attacker.  At the same time, node B can send its own
		  nonces in all messages to node A (to be echoed by node A), so that it
		  too can verify that it is receiving fresh messages.</t>

	       <t>The receiver may be expected to have resources for computing
		  pseudo-random numbers useful as nonces, according to <xref target="RFC4086"/>. 
		  It inserts a new nonce
		  as the high-order 32 bits of the Identification field of every
		  GNAM.  The receiver copies the low-order 32 bits of
		  the Identification field from the GNM into the
		  low-order 32 bits of the Identification field in the GNAM.
		  When the sender receives an authenticated GNAM
		  from the receiver, it saves the high-order 32 bits of the
		  Identification field for use as the high-order 32 bits of its next
		  GNM.</t>

	       <t>The sender is responsible for generating the low-order 32 bits
		  of the Identification field in each GNM.  Ideally, it
		  should generate its own random nonces.  However, it may use any
		  expedient method, including duplication of the random value sent by
		  the receiver.  The method chosen is of concern only to the sender
		  because it is the node that checks for valid values in the
		  GNAM.  The high-order and low-order 32 bits of the
		  Identification chosen SHOULD both differ from their previous values.
		   For each notification message, the receiver uses a new high-order value and the sender uses a
		  new low-order value.</t>

	       <t>If a GNM is rejected because of an invalid nonce,
		  the GNAM always provides the sender with a new nonce to be used
		  in the next message.  Thus, the nonce protocol is self-synchronizing.</t>

	 <section title="Non-Authentication Extensions Handling in the Foreign Agent">

	    <t>When the FA is relaying a GNM between the MN and the HA, 
	       and if the FA does not share a mobility security association with the
	       MN or HA, all non-authentication extensions between the MN and FA, or FA and 
	       HA, are not protected. In this case, all non-authentication extensions
	       should be silently discarded.</t>
