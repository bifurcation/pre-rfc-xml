    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

   <t><xref target="RFC3552" /> provides detailed guidance to protocol designers about both how to consider security as part of protocol design and how to inform readers of protocol specifications about security issues. This document intends to provide a similar set of guidelines for considering privacy in protocol design.</t> 

   <t>Privacy is a complicated concept with a rich history that spans many disciplines. With regard to data, often it is a concept applied to "personal data", commonly defined as information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. Many sets of privacy principles and privacy design frameworks have been developed in different forums over the years. These include the <xref target="FIPs">Fair Information Practices</xref>, a baseline set of privacy protections pertaining to the collection and use of personal data (often based on the principles established in <xref target="OECD" />, for example), and the Privacy by Design concept, which provides high-level privacy guidance for systems design (see <xref target="PbD" /> for one example). The guidance provided in this document is inspired by this prior work, but it aims to be more concrete, pointing protocol designers to specific engineering choices that can impact the privacy of the individuals that make use of Internet protocols.</t>

        <t>Different people have radically different conceptions of
        what privacy means, both in general and as it relates to them
        personally <xref target="Westin" />. Furthermore, privacy as a legal concept is understood differently in different jurisdictions. The guidance provided in this document is generic and can be used to inform the design of any protocol to be used anywhere in the world, without reference to specific legal frameworks.</t>
        
        <t>Whether any individual document warrants a specific privacy
considerations section will depend on the document's content. Documents whose
entire focus is privacy may not merit a separate section (for example, "Private
Extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Asserted Identity
within Trusted Networks" <xref target="RFC3325" />). For certain
specifications, privacy considerations are a subset of security considerations
and can be discussed explicitly in the security considerations section. Some
documents will not require discussion of privacy considerations (for example,
"Definition of the Opus Audio Codec" <xref target="RFC6716" />). The guidance
provided here can and should be used to assess the privacy considerations of
protocol, architectural, and operational specifications and to decide whether
those considerations are to be documented in a stand-alone section, within the
security considerations section, or throughout the document. The guidance
provided here is meant to help the thought process of privacy analysis; it does not provide specific directions for how to write a privacy considerations section.</t>

        <t>This document is organized as follows. <xref target="scope"/>
describes the extent to which the guidance offered here is applicable within
the IETF and within the larger Internet community.
<xref target="terminology" /> explains the terminology used in this document.
<xref target="communications-model" /> reviews typical communications
architectures to understand at which points there may be privacy threats.
<xref target="privacy-threats"/> discusses threats to privacy as they apply to
Internet protocols.
<xref target="privacy-goals" /> outlines mitigations of those threats.
<xref target="guidelines"/> provides the guidelines for analyzing and
documenting privacy considerations within IETF specifications.
<xref target="example"/> examines the privacy characteristics of an IETF
protocol to demonstrate the use of the guidance framework. 
   </t>

<!-- ================================================================== -->

        <section anchor="scope" title="Scope of Privacy Implications of Internet Protocols"> 

        <t>Internet protocols are often built flexibly, making them useful in a variety of architectures, contexts, and deployment scenarios without requiring significant interdependency between disparately designed components. Although protocol designers often have a particular target architecture or set of architectures in mind at design time, it is not uncommon for architectural frameworks to develop later, after implementations exist and have been deployed in combination with other protocols or components to form complete systems.</t>

        <t>As a consequence, the extent to which protocol designers can foresee all of the privacy implications of a particular protocol at design time is limited. An individual protocol may be relatively benign on its own, and it may make use of privacy and security features at lower layers of the protocol stack (Internet Protocol Security, Transport Layer Security, and so forth) to mitigate the risk of attack. But when deployed within a larger system or used in a way not envisioned at design time, its use may create new privacy risks. Protocols are often implemented and deployed long after design time by different people than those who did the protocol design. The guidelines in <xref target="guidelines" /> ask protocol designers to consider how their protocols are expected to interact with systems and information that exist outside the protocol bounds, but not to imagine every possible deployment scenario.</t>

        <t>Furthermore, in many cases the privacy properties of a system are dependent upon the complete system design where various protocols are combined together to form a product solution; the implementation, which includes the user interface design; and operational deployment practices, including default privacy settings and security processes of the company doing the deployment. These details are specific to particular instantiations and generally outside the scope of the work conducted in the IETF. The guidance provided here may be useful in making choices about these details, but its primary aim is to assist with the design, implementation, and operation of protocols.</t> 

        <t>Transparency of data collection and use -- often effectuated through user interface design -- is normally relied on (whether rightly or wrongly) as a key factor in determining the privacy impact of a system. Although most IETF activities do not involve standardizing user interfaces or user-facing communications, in some cases, understanding expected user interactions can be important for protocol design. Unexpected user behavior may have an adverse impact on security and/or privacy.</t> 

        <t>        In sum, privacy issues, even those related to
        protocol development, go beyond the technical
        guidance discussed herein. As an example, consider HTTP <xref
target="RFC2616" />, which was designed to allow the exchange of arbitrary
data. A complete analysis of the privacy considerations for uses of HTTP might
include what type of data is exchanged, how this data is stored, and how it is
processed. Hence the analysis for an individual's static personal web page
would be different than the use of HTTP for exchanging health records. A
protocol designer working on HTTP extensions (such as Web Distributed Authoring
and Versioning (WebDAV) <xref target="RFC4918" />) is not expected to describe
the privacy risks derived from all possible usage scenarios, but rather the
privacy properties specific to the extensions and any particular uses of the
extensions that are expected and foreseen at design time.</t>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
        
        <t>This section defines basic terms used in this document, with references to pre-existing definitions as appropriate. As in <xref target="RFC4949" />, each entry is preceded by a dollar sign ($) and a space for automated searching. Note that this document does not try to attempt to define the term 'privacy' with a brief definition. Instead, privacy is the sum of what is contained in this document. We therefore follow the approach taken by <xref target="RFC3552"/>. Examples of several different brief definitions are provided in <xref target="RFC4949" />.</t> 
        
        <section anchor="entities" title="Entities">

<t>Several of these terms are further elaborated in <xref target="communications-model" />.</t>

                <t>
                <list style="hanging">

            <t hangText="$ Attacker:">
            An entity that works against one or more privacy protection goals. Unlike observers, attackers' behavior is unauthorized.</t>

            <t hangText="$ Eavesdropper:">
            A type of attacker that passively observes an initiator's communications without the initiator's knowledge or authorization. See <xref target="RFC4949" />.</t>

            <t hangText="$ Enabler:" >
            A protocol entity that facilitates communication between an initiator and a recipient without being directly in the communications path.</t>
            
            <t hangText="$ Individual:" >
                A human being.</t>

                <t hangText="$ Intermediary:">
                A protocol entity that sits between the initiator and the recipient and is necessary for the initiator and recipient to communicate. Unlike an eavesdropper, an intermediary is 
                an entity that is part of the communication architecture and
therefore at least tacitly authorized. For example, a SIP 
<xref target="RFC3261" /> proxy is an intermediary in the SIP architecture.</t>

                <t hangText="$ Observer:" >
            An entity that is able to observe and collect
                 information from communications, potentially posing privacy
                 threats, depending on the context.  As defined in this document,
                 initiators, recipients, intermediaries, and enablers can all be
                 observers. Observers are distinguished from eavesdroppers by
                 being at least tacitly authorized.</t>

            <t hangText="$ Recipient:">
            A protocol entity that receives communications from an initiator.</t>

            natural names -- official names, personal names, and/or nicknames
            -- or can be artificial (for example, x9z32vb). However,

<section anchor="communications-model" title="Communications Model">

        <t>To understand attacks in the privacy-harm sense, it is helpful to
consider the overall communication architecture and different actors' roles
within it. Consider a protocol entity, the "initiator", that initiates
communication with some recipient. Privacy analysis is most relevant for
protocols with use cases in which the initiator acts on behalf of an individual
(or different individuals at different times). It is this individual whose
privacy is potentially threatened (although in some instances an initiator
communicates information about another individual, in which case both of their
privacy interests will be implicated).</t>  

            <t>Communications may be direct between the initiator and
            the recipient, or they may involve an application-layer
            intermediary (such as a proxy, cache, or relay) that is
            necessary for the two parties to communicate.  In some cases, this
            intermediary stays in the communication path for the entire
            duration of the communication; sometimes it is only used for
            communication establishment, for either inbound or outbound
            communication.  In some cases, there may be a series of
            intermediaries that are traversed. At lower layers, additional
            entities involved in packet forwarding may interfere with
            privacy protection goals as well.
</t>

        <t>Some communications tasks require multiple protocol interactions with different entities. For example, a request to an HTTP server may be preceded by an interaction between the initiator and an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server for network access and to a Domain Name System (DNS) server for name resolution. In this case, the HTTP server is the recipient and the other entities are enablers of the initiator-to-recipient communication. Similarly, a single communication with the recipient might generate further protocol interactions between either the initiator or the recipient and other entities, and the roles of the entities might change with each interaction. For example, an HTTP request might trigger interactions with an authentication server or with other resource servers wherein the recipient becomes an initiator in those later interactions. </t>   
        
        <t>Thus, when conducting privacy analysis of an architecture that involves multiple communications phases, the entities involved may take on different -- or opposing -- roles from a privacy considerations perspective in each phase. Understanding the privacy implications of the architecture as a whole may require a separate analysis of each phase.</t>
        
        <t>Protocol design is often predicated on the notion that recipients, intermediaries, and enablers are assumed to be authorized to receive and handle data from initiators. As <xref target="RFC3552" /> explains, "we assume that the end systems engaging in a protocol exchange have not themselves been compromised". However, privacy analysis requires questioning this assumption, since systems are often compromised for the purpose of obtaining personal data.</t>  

        <t>Although recipients, intermediaries, and enablers may not generally be considered as attackers, they may all pose privacy threats (depending on the context) because they are able to observe, collect, process, and transfer privacy-relevant data. These entities are collectively described below as "observers" to distinguish them from traditional attackers. From a privacy perspective, one important
         type of attacker is an eavesdropper: an entity that passively
         observes the initiator's communications without the initiator's
         knowledge or authorization.</t> 
        
        <t>The threat descriptions in the next section explain how observers and attackers might act to harm individuals' privacy. Different kinds of attacks may be feasible at different points in the communications path. For example, an observer could mount surveillance or identification attacks between the initiator and intermediary, or instead could surveil an enabler (e.g., by observing DNS queries from the initiator).</t>

<section anchor="privacy-threats" title="Privacy Threats">

        <t>Privacy harms come in a number of forms, including harms to financial standing, reputation, solitude, autonomy, and safety. A victim of identity theft or blackmail, for example, may suffer a financial loss as a result. Reputational harm can occur when disclosure of information about an individual, whether true or false, subjects that individual to stigma, embarrassment, or loss of personal dignity. Intrusion or interruption of an individual's life or activities can harm the individual's ability to be left alone. When individuals or their activities are monitored, exposed, or at risk of exposure, those individuals may be stifled from expressing themselves, associating with others, and generally conducting their lives freely. They may also feel a general sense of unease, in that it is "creepy" to be monitored or to have data collected about them. In cases where such monitoring is for the purpose of stalking or violence (for example, monitoring communications to or from a domestic abuse shelter), it can put individuals in physical danger.</t>

                <t>This section lists common privacy threats (drawing liberally from <xref target="Solove" />, as well as <xref target="CoE" />), showing how each of them may cause individuals to incur privacy harms and providing examples of how these threats can exist on the Internet. This threat modeling is inspired by security threat analysis. Although it is not a perfect fit for assessing privacy risks in Internet protocols and systems, no better methodology has been developed to date.</t>

        <t>Some privacy threats are already considered in Internet protocols as a matter of routine security analysis. Others are more pure privacy threats that existing security considerations do not usually address. The threats described here are divided into those that may also be considered security threats and those that are primarily privacy threats.</t>

        <t>Note that an individual's awareness of and consent to the practices
          described below may change an individual's perception of and concern 
          for the extent to which they threaten privacy.  If an individual
          authorizes surveillance of his own activities, for example, the
          individual may be able to take actions to mitigate the harms
          associated with it or may consider the risk of harm to be tolerable.</t> 

<section anchor="security-privacy-threats" title="Combined Security-Privacy Threats">

<section anchor="surveillance" title="Surveillance">

        <t>Surveillance is the observation or monitoring of an individual's
communications or activities. The effects of surveillance on the individual can
range from anxiety and discomfort to behavioral changes such as inhibition and
self-censorship, and even to the perpetration of violence against the
individual. The individual need not be aware of the surveillance for it to
impact his or her privacy -- the possibility of surveillance may be
enough to harm individual autonomy.</t>
        
        <t>Surveillance can impact privacy, even if the individuals being
surveilled are not identifiable or if their communications are encrypted. For
example, an observer or eavesdropper that conducts traffic analysis may be able
to determine what type of traffic is present (real-time communications or bulk
file transfers, for example) or which protocols are in use, even if the observed
communications are encrypted or the communicants are unidentifiable. This kind
of surveillance can adversely impact the individuals involved by causing them
to become targets for further investigation or enforcement activities. It may also enable 
         attacks that are specific to the protocol, such as redirection
         to a specialized interception point or protocol-specific denials
         of service. Protocols that use predictable packet sizes or timing 
         or include fixed tokens at predictable offsets within a packet can 
         facilitate this kind of surveillance.</t>

        <t>Surveillance can be conducted by observers or eavesdroppers at any
point along the communications path. Confidentiality protections (as discussed
in Section 3 of <xref target="RFC3552" />) are necessary to prevent surveillance of the content of communications. To prevent traffic analysis or other surveillance of communications patterns, other measures may be necessary, such as <xref target="Tor" />.</t> 
</section> 

<section anchor="stored-data-compromise" title="Stored Data Compromise">

<t>End systems that do not take adequate measures to secure stored data from unauthorized or inappropriate access expose individuals to potential financial, reputational, or physical harm.</t> 

        <t>Protecting against stored data compromise is typically outside the scope of IETF protocols. However, a number of common protocol functions -- key management, access control, or operational logging, for example -- require the storage of data about initiators of communications. When requiring or recommending that information about initiators or their communications be stored or logged by end systems (see, e.g., RFC 6302 <xref target="RFC6302"/>), it is important to recognize the potential for that information to be compromised and for that potential to be weighed against the benefits of data storage. Any recipient, intermediary, or enabler that stores data may be vulnerable to compromise. (Note that stored data compromise is distinct from purposeful disclosure, which is discussed in <xref target="disclosure" />.)</t>
</section> 

<section anchor="intrusion" title="Intrusion">

        <t>Intrusion consists of invasive acts that disturb or interrupt one's life or activities. Intrusion can thwart individuals' desires to be left alone, sap their time or attention, or interrupt their activities. This threat is focused on intrusion into one's life rather than direct intrusion into one's communications. The latter is captured in <xref target="surveillance"/>.</t> 

        <t>Unsolicited messages and denial-of-service attacks are the most common types of intrusion on the Internet. Intrusion can be perpetrated by any attacker that is capable of sending unwanted traffic to the initiator.</t>
</section> 

<section anchor="misattribution" title="Misattribution">
        <t>Misattribution occurs when data or communications related to one individual are attributed to another. Misattribution can result in adverse reputational, financial, or other consequences for individuals that are misidentified.</t>
        
        <t>Misattribution in the protocol context comes as a result of using
inadequate or insecure forms of identity or authentication, and is sometimes
related to spoofing. For example, as <xref target="RFC6269" /> notes, abuse
mitigation is often conducted on the basis of the source IP address, such that
connections from individual IP addresses may be prevented or temporarily
blacklisted if abusive activity is determined to be sourced from those
addresses. However, in the case where a single IP address is shared by multiple
individuals, those penalties may be suffered by all individuals sharing the
address, even if they were not involved in the abuse. This threat can be
mitigated by using identity management mechanisms with proper forms of
authentication (ideally with cryptographic properties) so that
actions can be attributed uniquely to an individual to provide the basis for
accountability without generating false positives.</t>  
</section>

</section> 

<section anchor="privacy-specific-threats" title="Privacy-Specific Threats">

<section anchor="correlation" title="Correlation">

        <t>Correlation is the combination of various pieces of information related to an individual or that obtain that characteristic when combined. Correlation can defy people's expectations of the limits of what others know about them. It can increase the power that those doing the correlating have over individuals as well as correlators' ability to pass judgment, threatening individual autonomy and reputation.</t>

        <t>Correlation is closely related to identification. Internet protocols can facilitate correlation by allowing individuals' activities to be tracked and combined over time. The use of persistent or infrequently replaced identifiers at any layer of the stack can facilitate correlation. For example, an initiator's persistent use of the same device ID, certificate, or email address across multiple interactions could allow recipients (and observers) to correlate all of the initiator's communications over time. </t>  

<t>As an example, consider Transport Layer Security (TLS) session resumption <xref target="RFC5246"/> or TLS session resumption without server-side state <xref target="RFC5077"/>. In RFC 5246 <xref target="RFC5246"/>, a server provides the client with a session_id in the ServerHello message and caches the master_secret for later exchanges. When the client initiates a new connection with the server, it re-uses the previously obtained session_id in its ClientHello message. The server agrees to resume the session by using the same session_id and the previously stored master_secret for the generation of the TLS Record Layer security association. RFC 5077 <xref target="RFC5077"/> borrows from the session resumption design idea, but the server encapsulates all state information into a ticket instead of caching it. An attacker who is able to observe the protocol exchanges between the TLS client and the TLS server is able to link the initial exchange to subsequently resumed TLS sessions when the session_id and the ticket are exchanged in the clear (which is the case with data exchanged in the initial handshake messages). </t>

        <t>In theory, any observer or attacker that receives an initiator's communications can engage in correlation. The extent of the potential for correlation will depend on what data the entity receives from the initiator and has access to otherwise. Often, intermediaries only require a small amount of information for message routing and/or security.  In theory, protocol
          mechanisms could ensure that end-to-end information is not made
          accessible to these entities, but in practice the difficulty of
          deploying end-to-end security procedures, additional messaging or
          computational overhead, and other business or legal requirements
          often slow or prevent the deployment of end-to-end security
          mechanisms, giving intermediaries greater exposure to initiators' data than is strictly necessary from a technical point of view.</t>
</section> 

<section anchor="identification" title="Identification">

        <t>Identification is the linking of information to a particular individual to infer an individual's identity or to allow the inference of an individual's identity. In some contexts, it is perfectly legitimate to identify individuals, whereas in others, identification may potentially stifle individuals' activities or expression by inhibiting their ability to be anonymous or pseudonymous. Identification also makes it easier for individuals to be explicitly controlled by others (e.g., governments) and to be treated differentially compared to other individuals.</t>

        <t>Many protocols provide functionality to convey the idea that some
means has been provided to validate that entities are who they claim to
be. Often, this is accomplished with cryptographic authentication. Furthermore,
many protocol identifiers, such as those used in SIP or the Extensible
Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), may allow for the direct identification of individuals. Protocol identifiers may also contribute indirectly to identification via correlation. For example, a web site that does not directly authenticate users may be able to match its HTTP header logs with logs from another site that does authenticate users, rendering users on the first site identifiable.</t> 

        <t>As with correlation, any observer or attacker may be able to engage
in identification, depending on the information about the initiator that is
available via the protocol mechanism or other channels.</t>  
</section> 

<section anchor="secondary-use" title="Secondary Use">

        <t>Secondary use is the use of collected information about an individual without the individual's consent for a purpose different from that for which the information was collected. Secondary use may violate people's expectations or desires. The potential for secondary use can generate uncertainty as to how one's information will be used in the future, potentially discouraging information exchange in the first place. Secondary use encompasses any use of data, including disclosure.</t>

        <t>One example of secondary use would be 
        an authentication server that uses a network access server's Access-Requests to track an initiator's location. Any observer or attacker could potentially make unwanted secondary uses of initiators' data. Protecting against secondary use is typically outside the scope of IETF protocols.</t>  
</section> 

<section anchor="disclosure" title="Disclosure">

        <t>Disclosure is the revelation of information about an individual that affects the way others judge the individual. Disclosure can violate individuals' expectations of the confidentiality of the data they share. The threat of disclosure may deter people from engaging in certain activities for fear of reputational harm, or simply because they do not wish to be observed.</t> 

        <t>Any observer or attacker that receives data about an initiator may engage in disclosure. Sometimes disclosure is unintentional because system designers do not realize that information being exchanged relates to individuals. The most common way for protocols to limit disclosure is by providing access control mechanisms (discussed in <xref target="exclusion"/>).  A further example is provided by the IETF geolocation privacy architecture <xref target="RFC6280" />, which supports a way for users to express a preference that their location information not be disclosed beyond the intended recipient.</t>  
</section> 

<section anchor="exclusion" title="Exclusion">

        <t>Exclusion is the failure to allow individuals to know about the data
that others have about them and to participate in its handling and
use. Exclusion reduces accountability on the part of entities that maintain
information about people and creates a sense of vulnerability in relation to
individuals' ability to control how information about them is collected and
used.</t>

        <t>The most common way for Internet protocols to be involved in enforcing exclusion is through access control mechanisms. The presence architecture developed in the IETF is a good example where individuals are included in the control of information about them. Using a rules expression language (e.g., presence authorization rules <xref target="RFC5025" />), presence clients can authorize the specific conditions under which their presence information may be shared.</t> 

        <t>Exclusion is primarily considered problematic when the recipient fails to involve the initiator in decisions about data collection, handling, and use. Eavesdroppers engage in exclusion by their very nature, since their data collection and handling practices are covert.</t>

<section anchor="privacy-goals" title="Threat Mitigations"> 

<t>Privacy is notoriously difficult to measure and quantify. The extent to which a particular protocol, system, or architecture "protects" or "enhances" privacy is dependent on a large number of factors relating to its design, use, and potential misuse. However, there are certain widely recognized classes of mitigations against the threats discussed in <xref target="privacy-threats" />. This section describes three categories of relevant mitigations: (1) data minimization, (2) user participation, and (3) security. The privacy mitigations described in this section can loosely be mapped to existing privacy principles, such as the Fair Information Practices, but they have been adapted to fit the target audience of this document.</t> 

<section anchor="data-minimization-goal" title="Data Minimization">

<t>Data minimization refers to collecting, using, disclosing, and storing the
minimal data necessary to perform a task. Reducing the amount of data exchanged
reduces the amount of data that can be misused or leaked.</t> 

        <t>Data minimization can be effectuated in a number of different ways, including by limiting collection, use, disclosure, retention, identifiability, sensitivity, and access to personal data. Limiting the data collected by protocol elements to only what is necessary (collection limitation) is the most straightforward way to help reduce privacy risks associated with the use of the protocol. In some cases, protocol designers may also be able to recommend limits to the use or retention of data, although protocols themselves are not often capable of controlling these properties.</t>
                
        <t>However, the most direct application of data minimization to protocol design is limiting identifiability. Reducing the identifiability of data by using pseudonyms or no identifiers at all helps to weaken the link between an individual and his or her communications. Allowing for the periodic creation of new or randomized identifiers reduces the possibility that multiple protocol interactions or communications can be correlated back to the same individual. The following sections explore a number of different properties related to identifiability that protocol designers may seek to achieve.</t>
                
        <t>Data minimization mitigates the following threats: surveillance,
stored data compromise, correlation, identification, secondary use, and
disclosure.</t>
        
        <section anchor="further-anonymity" title="Anonymity">

            <t>To enable anonymity of an individual, there must exist a set of individuals that appear to have the same attribute(s) as the individual. To the attacker or the observer, these individuals must appear indistinguishable from each other. The set of all such individuals is known as the anonymity set, and membership of this set may vary over time. </t>

            <t>The composition of the anonymity set depends on the knowledge of the observer or attacker. Thus, anonymity is relative with respect to the observer or attacker. An initiator may be anonymous only within a set of potential initiators -- its initiator anonymity set -- which itself may be a subset of all individuals that may initiate communications. Conversely, a recipient may be anonymous only within a set of potential recipients -- its recipient anonymity set. Both anonymity sets may be disjoint, may overlap, or may be the same. 
           </t>

              <t>As an example, consider RFC 3325 (P-Asserted-Identity (PAI))
<xref target="RFC3325"/>, an extension for the Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) that allows an individual, such as a Voice over IP (VoIP) caller, to instruct an intermediary that he or she trusts not to populate the SIP From header field with the individual's authenticated and verified identity. The recipient of the call, as well as any other entity outside of the individual's trust domain, would therefore only learn that the SIP message (typically a SIP INVITE) was sent with a header field 'From: "Anonymous" &lt;sip:anonymous@anonymous.invalid&gt;' rather than the individual's address-of-record, which is typically thought of as the "public address" of the user. When PAI is used, the individual becomes anonymous within the initiator anonymity set that is populated by every individual making use of that specific intermediary.
                </t>
                <t>Note that this example ignores the fact that the recipient
may infer or obtain personal data from the other SIP payloads (e.g.,
SIP Via and Contact headers, the Session Description Protocol (SDP)). The
implication is that PAI only attempts to address a particular threat, namely
the disclosure of identity (in the From header) with respect to the
recipient. This caveat makes the analysis of the specific protocol extension
easier but cannot be assumed when conducting analysis of an entire
architecture.
                </t>        

        </section>

        <section anchor="further-pseudonymity" title="Pseudonymity">

                <t>In the context of Internet protocols, almost all identifiers can be
                  nicknames or pseudonyms, since there is typically no requirement 
              to use personal names in protocols. However, in certain scenarios it is reasonable to assume that personal names 
              will be used (with vCard <xref target="RFC6350" />, for example). </t>

                  <t>Pseudonymity is strengthened when less personal data can be linked to the pseudonym; when the same pseudonym is used less often and across fewer contexts; and when independently chosen 
                    pseudonyms are more frequently used for new actions (making them, from an observer's or attacker's perspective, unlinkable).</t>

            <t>For Internet protocols, the following are important
            considerations: whether protocols allow pseudonyms to be
            changed without human interaction, the default length of
            pseudonym lifetimes, to whom pseudonyms are exposed, how
            individuals are able to control disclosure, how often pseudonyms
            can be changed, and the consequences of changing them.</t>

        </section>

        <section title="Identity Confidentiality">

            <t>An initiator has identity confidentiality when any party other
than the recipient 
            cannot sufficiently identify the initiator within the anonymity
set. 
            The size of the anonymity set has a direct impact on identity
confidentiality, since the smaller the set is, the easier it is to identify the
initiator.
            Identity confidentiality aims to provide a protection against
eavesdroppers and intermediaries rather than against the intended communication
endpoints.</t>

              <t>As an example, consider the network access authentication procedures utilizing the Extensible Authentication 
              Protocol (EAP) <xref target="RFC3748"/>. EAP includes an identity
exchange where the Identity Response is primarily used for routing purposes and
selecting which EAP method to use. Since EAP Identity Requests and Identity
Responses are sent in cleartext, eavesdroppers and intermediaries along the
communication path between the EAP peer and the EAP server can snoop on the
identity, which is encoded in the form of the Network Access Identifier (NAI)
as defined in RFC 4282 <xref target="RFC4282"/>. To address this threat, as
discussed in RFC 4282 <xref target="RFC4282"/>, the username part of the NAI
(but not the realm part) can be hidden from these eavesdroppers and
intermediaries with the cryptographic support offered by EAP methods. Identity
confidentiality has become a recommended design criteria for EAP (see <xref
target="RFC4017"/>). The EAP method for 3rd Generation Authentication and Key
Agreement (EAP-AKA) <xref target="RFC4187"/>, for example, protects the EAP
peer's identity against passive adversaries by utilizing temporal
identities. The EAP-Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2
(EAP-IKEv2) method <xref target="RFC5106"/> is an example of an EAP method
that offers protection against active attackers with regard to the individual's
identity. </t>

           </section> 

        <section title="Data Minimization within Identity Management">

                <t>Modern systems are increasingly relying on multi-party transactions to authenticate individuals. Many of these systems make use of an identity provider that is responsible for providing AAA functionality to relying parties that offer some protected resources. To facilitate these functions, an identity provider will usually go through a process of verifying the individual's identity and issuing credentials to the individual. When an individual seeks to make use of a service provided by the relying party, the relying party relies on the authentication assertions provided by its identity provider. Note that in more sophisticated scenarios the authentication assertions are traits that demonstrate the individual's capabilities and roles. The authorization responsibility may also be shared between the identity provider and the relying party and does not necessarily need to reside only with the identity provider.</t>
                    
            <t>Such systems have the ability to support a number of properties that minimize data collection in different ways:</t>
        
        <t><list style="hanging">
                <t>In certain use cases, relying parties do not need to know the real name or date of birth of an individual (for example, when the individual's age is the only attribute that needs to be authenticated).</t>
                <t>Relying parties that collude can be prevented from using an individual's credentials to track the individual. That is, two different relying parties can be prevented from determining that the same individual has authenticated to both of them. This
                     typically requires identity management protocol support
                     as well as support by both the relying party and the identity
                     provider.</t>
                <t>The identity provider can be prevented from knowing which
relying parties an individual interacted with. This requires, at a minimum, avoiding direct communication between the identity provider 
                and the relying party at the time when access to a resource by the initiator is made.</t>
        
                </list></t>
                
        </section>
        
</section> 

<section anchor="user-participation-goal" title="User Participation">

<t>As explained in <xref target="exclusion" />, data collection and use that happen "in secret", without the individual's knowledge, are apt to violate the individual's expectation of privacy and may create incentives for misuse of data. As a result, privacy regimes tend to include provisions to require informing individuals about data collection and use and involving them in decisions about the treatment of their data. In an engineering context, supporting the goal of user participation usually means providing ways for users to control the data that is shared about them. It may also mean providing ways for users to signal how they expect their data to be used and shared. Different protocol and architectural designs can make supporting user participation (for example, the ability to support a dialog box for user interaction) easier or harder; for example, OAuth-based services may have more natural hooks for user input than AAA services.</t>

<t>User participation mitigates the following threats: surveillance, secondary
use, disclosure, and exclusion.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="security-goal" title="Security">

<t>Keeping data secure at rest and in transit is another important
component of privacy protection. As they are described in
Section 2 of <xref target="RFC3552" />, a number of security goals also serve
to enhance privacy:</t>

<t><list style='symbols'>

        <t>Confidentiality: Keeping data secret from unintended listeners.</t>

        <t>Peer entity authentication: Ensuring that the endpoint of a communication is the one that is intended (in support of maintaining confidentiality).</t>

        <t>Unauthorized usage: Limiting data access to only those users who are authorized. (Note that this goal also falls within data minimization.)</t>

        <t>Inappropriate usage: Limiting how authorized users can use data. (Note that this goal also falls within data minimization.)</t>
        
</list></t>

<t>Note that even when these goals are achieved, the existence of items of interest -- attributes, identifiers, identities, communications, actions (such as the sending or receiving of a communication), or anything else an attacker or observer might be interested in -- may still be detectable, even if they are not readable. Thus, undetectability, in which an observer or attacker cannot sufficiently distinguish whether an item of interest exists or not, may be considered as a further security goal (albeit one that can be extremely difficult to accomplish).</t>

<t>Detection of the protocols or applications in use via traffic analysis may be particularly difficult to defend against. As with the anonymity of individuals, achieving "protocol anonymity" requires that multiple protocols or 
 applications exist that appear to have the same attributes -- packet sizes, content, token locations, or inter&nbhy;packet timing, for example. An attacker or observer will not be able to use traffic analysis to identify which protocol or application is in use if multiple protocols or applications are indistinguishable.</t>

<t>Defending against the threat of traffic analysis will be possible to
different extents for different protocols, may depend on implementation- or
use-specific details, and may depend on which other protocols already exist and
whether they share similar traffic characteristics. The defenses will also vary
relative to what the protocol is designed to do; for example, in some situations randomizing packet sizes, timing, or token locations will reduce the threat of traffic analysis, whereas in other situations (real-time communications, for example) holding some or all of those factors constant is a more appropriate defense. See "Guidelines for the Use of Variable Bit Rate Audio with Secure RTP" <xref target="RFC6562" /> for an example of how these kinds of trade-offs should be evaluated.</t>

<t>By providing proper security protection, the following threats can be
mitigated: surveillance, stored data compromise, misattribution, secondary use,
disclosure, and intrusion.</t>

recommendations about particular uses of data or how privacy might be balanced

analysis that can serve as the basis for discussion of whether the protocol
adequately protects against privacy threats. This guidance is meant to help the thought process of privacy analysis; it does not provide specific directions for how to write a privacy considerations section.</t> 

<t>The framework is divided into four sections: three sections that address

    <section anchor="example" title="Example">
        <t> The following section gives an example of the threat analysis and
threat mitigations recommended by this document. It covers a particularly
difficult application protocol, presence,
           to try to demonstrate these principles on an architecture that is vulnerable to many of the threats described above. 
           This text is not intended as an example of a privacy considerations section that might appear in an IETF specification,
           but rather as an example of the thinking that should go into the design of a protocol when considering privacy as
           a first principle.</t>

           <t>A presence service, as defined in the abstract in <xref target="RFC2778" />,
           allows users of a communications service to monitor one another's
           availability and disposition in order to make decisions about
           communicating.  Presence information is highly dynamic and generally
           characterizes whether a user is online or offline, busy or idle, away
           from communications devices or nearby, and the like.  Necessarily,
           this information has certain privacy implications, and from the start
           the IETF approached this work with the aim of providing users with the
           controls to determine how their presence information would be shared.
           The Common Profile for Presence (CPP) <xref target="RFC3859" /> defines a set of
           logical operations for delivery of presence information.  This
           abstract model is applicable to multiple presence systems.  The
           SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging
Extensions (SIMPLE) presence system <xref target="RFC3856" /> uses CPP as its baseline
           architecture, and the presence operations in the Extensible Messaging
           and Presence Protocol (XMPP) have also been mapped to CPP <xref
target="RFC3922" />.</t>

           <t>The fundamental architecture defined in RFC 2778 and RFC 3859 is a mediated
           one. Clients (presentities in RFC 2778 terms) publish their presence information to presence servers, which
           in turn distribute information to authorized watchers. Presence servers thus retain presence information
           for an interval of time, until it either changes or expires, so that it can be revealed to authorized
           watchers upon request. This architecture mirrors
           existing pre-standard deployment models. The integration of an explicit
           authorization mechanism into the presence architecture has been widely successful in
           involving the end users in the decision-making process before
           sharing information. Nearly all presence systems deployed today
           provide such a mechanism, typically through a reciprocal
           authorization system by which a pair of users, when they agree to be
           "buddies", consent to divulge their presence information to one
           another. Buddylists are managed by servers but controlled by end users. Users
           can also explicitly block one another through a similar interface, and in some deployments
           it is desirable to provide "polite blocking" of various kinds.</t>

          <t>From a perspective of privacy design, however, the classical presence architecture
           represents nearly a worst-case scenario. In terms of data minimization, presentities
           share their sensitive information with presence services, and while services only share this
           presence information with watchers authorized by the user, no technical mechanism constrains those
           watchers from relaying presence to further third parties. Any of these entities
           could conceivably log or retain presence information indefinitely. The sensitivity
           cannot be mitigated by rendering the user anonymous, as it is indeed the purpose of the
           system to facilitate communications between users who know one another. The identifiers employed
           by users are long-lived and often contain personal information, including personal names and the domains of service providers.
           While users do participate in the construction of buddylists and blacklists,
           they do so with little prospect for accountability:
           the user effectively throws their presence information over the wall to a presence server
           that in turn distributes the information to watchers. Users typically have no way to verify that presence
           is being distributed only to authorized watchers, especially as it is the server that authenticates
           watchers, not the end user. Moreover, connections between the server and all publishers and consumers of presence
           data are an attractive target for eavesdroppers and require strong confidentiality mechanisms, though
           again the end user has no way to verify what mechanisms are in place between the presence server and a watcher.</t>

           <t>Additionally, the sensitivity of presence information is not limited to
           the disposition and capability to communicate. Capabilities can reveal the type of device that a user employs, for example, and
           since multiple devices can publish the same user's presence, there are significant risks of allowing attackers to correlate user devices.
           An important extension to presence was developed to enable the support for
           location sharing.  The effort to standardize protocols for
           systems sharing geolocation was started in the GEOPRIV
           working group.  During the initial requirements and privacy threat
           analysis in the process of chartering the working group, it became
           clear that the system would require an underlying communication mechanism
           supporting user consent to share location information.  The
           resemblance of these requirements to the presence framework was
           quickly recognized, and this design decision was documented in <xref target="RFC4079" />. Location information thus mingles with other presence information available through the system
           to intermediaries and to authorized watchers.</t>

           <t>Privacy concerns about presence information largely arise due to the built-in mediation of the presence architecture.
           The need for a presence server is motivated by two primary design requirements of presence: in the first place,
           the server can respond with an "offline" indication when the user is not online; in the
           second place, the server can compose presence information published by different devices under
           the user's control. Additionally, to facilitate the use of URIs as identifiers for entities,
           some service must operate a host with the domain name appearing in a presence URI, and in practical
           terms no commercial presence architecture would force end users to own and operate their own domain names. 
           Many end users of applications like presence are behind NATs or firewalls and effectively cannot receive direct 
           connections from the Internet -- the persistent bidirectional channel these clients open and maintain with a presence
           server is essential to the operation of the protocol.</t>

           <t>One must first ask if the trade-off of mediation for presence is worthwhile.
           Does a server need to be in the middle of all publications of presence information? It might seem
           that end-to-end encryption of the presence information could solve many of these problems. A presentity
           could encrypt the presence information with the public key of a watcher and only then send the 
           presence information through the server.
           The IETF defined an object format for presence information
           called the Presence Information Data
           Format (PIDF), which for the purposes of conveying
           location information was extended to the PIDF Location
           Object (PIDF-LO) -- these XML objects were designed to accommodate an encrypted wrapper. 
           Encrypting this data would have the added benefit of preventing stored cleartext presence information from being
           seized by an attacker who manages to compromise a presence server.
           This proposal, however,
           quickly runs into usability problems. Discovering the public keys of watchers is the first difficulty,
           one that few Internet protocols have addressed successfully. This solution would then require the presentity to publish
           one encrypted copy of its presence information per authorized watcher to the presence service, regardless of whether
           or not a watcher is actively seeking presence information -- for a presentity with many watchers, this may
           place an unacceptable burden on the presence server, especially given the dynamism of presence information. Finally, it 
           prevents the server from composing presence information reported by multiple devices under the same user's control. On the whole,
           these difficulties render object encryption of presence information a doubtful prospect.</t>

           <t>Some protocols
           that support presence information, such as SIP, can operate intermediaries in 
           a redirecting mode rather than a publishing or proxying mode. Instead of sending presence information
           through the server, in other words, these protocols can merely redirect watchers to the presentity, and
           then presence information could pass directly and securely from the presentity to the watcher. 
           It is worth noting that this would disclose the IP address of the presentity to the watcher, which has its own set of risks. In that case,
           the presentity can decide exactly what information it would like to share with the watcher in question, it
           can authenticate the watcher itself with whatever strength of credential it chooses, and with end-to-end encryption
           it can reduce the likelihood of any eavesdropping. In a redirection architecture, a presence server could still
           provide the necessary "offline" indication without requiring the presence server to observe and forward all information 
           itself. This mechanism is more promising than encryption but also suffers from significant difficulties. It too does not
           provide for composition of presence information from multiple devices -- it in fact forces the watcher to perform this
           composition itself. The largest single impediment to this approach is, however, the 
           difficulty of creating end-to-end connections between the presentity's device(s) and a watcher, as some or all of these
           endpoints may be behind NATs or firewalls that prevent peer-to-peer connections. While there are potential solutions for
           this problem, like Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) and
Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN), they add complexity to the overall
system.</t>

           <t>Consequently, mediation is a difficult feature of the presence
architecture to remove. It is hard to minimize the data shared with
intermediaries, especially due to the requirement for composition. Control over
sharing with intermediaries must therefore
           come from some other explicit component of the architecture.  As such, the presence work
           in the IETF focused on improving user participation in the activities of the presence server. This work began in the GEOPRIV
           working group, with controls on location privacy, as location of users is perceived as having especially sensitive properties.
           With the aim of meeting the privacy requirements
           defined in <xref target="RFC2779" />, a set of usage indications, such as
           whether retransmission is allowed or when the retention period
           expires, have been added to the PIDF-LO such that they 
           always travel with the location information itself. These privacy preferences apply not only to the 
           intermediaries that store and forward presence information but also to the watchers who consume it.</t>

           <t>This approach very much follows the spirit of <xref target="CC">Creative Commons</xref>, namely the usage of a limited number of conditions
           (such as <xref target="CC-SA">'Share Alike'</xref>).  Unlike Creative Commons, the
           GEOPRIV working group did not, however, initiate work to produce
           legal language or design graphical icons, since this would fall
           outside the scope of the IETF.  In particular, the GEOPRIV rules
           state a preference on the retention and retransmission of location
           information; while GEOPRIV cannot force any entity receiving a
           PIDF-LO object to abide by those preferences, if users lack the
           ability to express them at all, we can guarantee their preferences
           will not be honored. The GEOPRIV rules can provide a means to establish accountability.</t>

           <t>The retention and retransmission elements were envisioned as the most essential examples of preference expression in sharing presence. The PIDF
           object was designed for extensibility, and the rulesets created for
the PIDF-LO can
           also be extended to provide new expressions of user preference. Not all user preference information
           should be bound into a particular PIDF object, however; many forms of access control policy assumed by
           the presence architecture need to be provisioned in the presence server by some interface with the user.
           This requirement eventually triggered the standardization of a general access control policy
           language called the common policy framework (defined in <xref
target="RFC4745" />).  This language allows one to express ways to control the
           distribution of information as simple conditions, actions, and
           transformation rules expressed in an XML format.  Common Policy
           itself is an abstract format that needs to be instantiated: two
           examples can be found with the presence authorization rules <xref target="RFC5025" />
           and the Geolocation Policy <xref target="RFC6772" />.  The former
           provides additional expressiveness for presence-based systems, while
           the latter defines syntax and semantics for location-based
           conditions and transformations.</t>

           <t>Ultimately, the privacy work on presence represents a compromise between privacy principles and
           the needs of the architecture and marketplace. While it was not feasible to remove intermediaries 
           from the architecture entirely or prevent their access to presence information, the IETF 
           did provide a way for users to express their preferences and provision their controls at the presence
           service. We have not had great successes in the implementation space with privacy mechanisms thus far, but by documenting and acknowledging the limitations of these mechanisms, the designers were able 
           to provide implementers, and end users, with an informed perspective on the privacy properties of the
           IETF's presence protocols.</t>
