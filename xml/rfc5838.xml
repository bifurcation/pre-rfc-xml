  <abstract>
   <t>This document describes a mechanism for supporting multiple address
   families (AFs) in OSPFv3 using multiple instances. It maps an AF to an
   OSPFv3 instance using the Instance ID field in the
   OSPFv3 packet header. This approach is fairly simple and minimizes
   extensions to OSPFv3 for supporting multiple AFs.</t>
  </abstract>

<section title="Introduction">
    <t>OSPFv3 <xref target="OSPFV3"/> has been defined to support the
        base IPv6 unicast address family (AF).  There are requirements
        to advertise other AFs in OSPFv3, including multicast IPv6,
        unicast IPv4, and multicast IPv4. This document supports these
        other AFs in OSPFv3 by mapping each AF to a separate Instance ID
        and OSPFv3 instance.</t>
<section title="Design Considerations">
   <t>This section describes the rationale for using the multiple
   Instance ID approach to support multiple address families in
   OSPFv3. As described earlier, OSPFv3 is designed to support multiple
   instances. Hence, mapping an instance to an address family doesn't
   introduce any new mechanisms to the protocol. It minimizes the protocol
   extensions required, and it simplifies the implementation. The
   presence of a separate link state database per address family is 
   also easier to debug and operate. Additionally, it doesn't change 
   the existing instance, area, and interface-based configuration model
   in most OSPFv3 implementations.</t>
</section>
<section title="Requirements Notation">
   <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
      "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
       and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
       described in <xref target="RFC-KEYWORDS"/>.</t>
</section>
</section>
<section title="Protocol Details">
   <t>Currently, the entire Instance ID number space is used for IPv6
       unicast. This specification assigns different Instance ID ranges
       to different AFs in order to support other AFs in OSPFv3. Each
       Instance ID implies a separate OSPFv3 instance with its own
       neighbor adjacencies, link state database, protocol data
       structures, and shortest path first (SPF) computation.</t>
   <t> Additionally, the current Link State Advertisements (LSAs) defined
       to advertise IPv6 unicast prefixes can be used to advertise prefixes
       from other AFs without modification.</t>
   <t>It should be noted that OSPFv3 runs on top of IPv6 and uses
       IPv6 link local addresses for OSPFv3 control packets. Therefore,
       it is required that IPv6 be enabled on an OSPFv3 link, although
       the link may not be participating in any IPv6 AFs.</t>
<section title="Instance ID Values for New AFs">
   <t>Instance ID zero is already defined by default for the IPv6 unicast AF.
   When this specification is used to support multiple AFs, 
   we define the following ranges for different AFs. The first value
   of each range is the default value for the corresponding AF.

<section anchor="AF" title="OSPFv3 Options Changes">
   <t>A new AF-bit is added to the OSPFv3 Options field. The V6-bit
      is only applicable to the IPv6 unicast AF.</t>

  </figure>
   <vspace blankLines="1" /><list style="hanging">  
   <t hangText="V6-bit"><vspace blankLines="0" />
      The V6-bit is used in OSPFv3 to exclude a node from IPv6 unicast
      route calculation but allow it in the SPF calculation for 
      other address families. Since the Instance ID now denotes the AF
      explicitly, this bit is ignored in AFs other than IPv6 unicast.</t>
   <t hangText="AF-bit"><vspace blankLines="0" />
    When an OSPFv3 router is supporting AFs as described in this specification, it 
    MUST set the AF-bit in the OSPFv3 Options field of Hello packets, Database
    Description packets, and LSAs.</t> 
   </list></t>
</section>
<section title="Advertising Prefixes in AFs Other Than IPv6">
   <t>Each prefix advertised in OSPFv3 has a prefix Length field 
   <xref target="OSPFV3"/>. This
   facilitates advertising prefixes of different lengths in different
   AFs. The existing LSAs defined in OSPFv3 are used for this
   and there is no need to define new LSAs.</t>
   <t>Prefixes that don't conform to the AF of an OSPFv3 instance MUST 
      NOT be used in the route computation for that instance.</t>

</section>
<section title="Changes to the Hello Packet Processing">
   <t>When an OSPFv3 router does not support this specification and 
   it is configured with the corresponding Instance ID, packets could be
   black holed. This could happen due to misconfiguration or a router 
   software downgrade.  Black holing is possible because a router that
   doesn't support this specification can still be included in the SPF calculated
   path as long as it establishes adjacencies using the Instance ID
   corresponding to the AF. Note that Router-LSAs and Network-LSAs are AF
   independent.</t>
   <t>In order to avoid the above situation, Hello packet processing is changed in
   order to only establish adjacencies with routers that have the
   AF-bit set in their Options field.</t>
   <t>Receiving Hello packets is specified in section 4.2.2.1 of <xref
target="OSPFV3"/>. The following check is added to Hello packet reception:
   <vspace blankLines="0" /><list style="symbols"> 
   <t>When an OSPFv3 router participates in an AF (sets the AF-bit in the Options field),
     it MUST discard Hello packets having the AF-bit clear in the Options
     field. The only exception is the Base IPv6 unicast AF, where this check
     MUST NOT be done (for backward compatibility).</t>
   </list></t>
</section>
<section title="Next-Hop Calculation for IPv4 Unicast and Multicast AFs">
   <t>OSPFv3 runs on top of IPv6 and uses IPv6 link local addresses
   for OSPFv3 control packets and next-hop calculations. Although IPv6
   link local addresses could be used as next hops for IPv4 address
   families, it is desirable to have IPv4 next-hop addresses. For 
   example, in the IPv4 multicast AF, the Protocol Independent
   Multicast (PIM) <xref target="PIM"/> neighbor address and the next-hop
   address should both be IPv4 addresses in order for the Reverse Path Forwarding
   (RPF) lookup to work correctly. Troubleshooting is also easier when 
   the prefix address and next-hop address are in the same AF.</t>

   <t>In order to achieve this, the link's IPv4 address will be advertised 
   in the "link local address" field of the IPv4 instance's Link-LSA.  
   This address is placed in the first 32 bits of the "link local address"
   field and is used for IPv4 next-hop calculations. The remaining bits
   MUST be set to zero.</t>

   <t>We denote a Direct Interface Address (DIA) as an IPv4 or IPv6 address that
   is both directly reachable via an attached link and has an available layer 3 to
   layer 2 mapping. Note that there is no explicit need for the IPv4 link 
   addresses to be on the same subnet. An implementation SHOULD resolve
   layer 3 to layer 2 mappings via the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) <xref target="ARP"/>
   or Neighbor Discovery (ND) <xref target="ND"/> for a DIA even if the IPv4
   address is not on the same subnet as the router's
   interface IP address.</t> 
</section>
<section title="AS-External-LSA and NSSA-LSA Forwarding Address for IPv4 Unicast and IPv4 Multicast AFs">
<t>For OSPFv3, this address is an IPv6 host address (128 bits).  If
    included, data traffic for the advertised destination will be
    forwarded to this address. For IPv4 unicast and IPv4 multicast AFs,
    the Forwarding Address in AS-external-LSAs and NSSA-LSAs MUST encode an
IPv4 
    address. To achieve this, the IPv4 Forwarding Address is advertised
    by placing it in the first 32 bits of the Forwarding Address field
    in AS-external-LSAs and NSSA-LSAs. The remaining bits MUST be set to
zero.</t> 

</section>
<section anchor="MTU" title="Database Description Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) 
Specification for Non-IPv6 AFs">
<t>For address families other than IPv6, both the MTU for the instance address
    family and the IPv6 MTU used for OSPFv3 maximum packet
    determination MUST be considered. The MTU in the Database
    Description packet MUST always contain the MTU corresponding to the
    advertised address family.  For example, if the instance corresponds
    to an IPv4 address family, the IPv4 MTU for the interface MUST be
    specified in the interface MTU field. As specified in Section 10.6 of
    <xref target="OSPFV2"/>, the Database Description packet will be
    rejected if the MTU is greater than the receiving interface's MTU
    for the address family corresponding to the instance. This behavior
    will assure that an adjacency is not formed and address family specific
    routes are not installed over a path with conflicting MTUs.</t>
<t>The value used for OSPFv3 maximum packet size determination MUST also
    be compatible for an adjacency to be established. Since only a
    single MTU field is specified, the M6-bit is defined by this
    specification.  If the M6-bit is clear, the specified MTU SHOULD
    also be checked against the IPv6 MTU, and the Database Description
    packet SHOULD be rejected if the MTU is larger than the receiving
    interface's IPv6 MTU.  An OSPFv3 router SHOULD NOT set the M6-bit if
    its IPv6 MTU and address family specific MTU are the same.</t>

<t> If the IPv6 and IPv4 MTUs differ, the M6-bit MUST be set for
    non-IPv6 address families. If the M6-bit is set, the IPv6 MTU is dictated
    by the presence or absence of an IPv6 MTU TLV in the link-local 
    signaling (LLS) <xref target="LLS"/> block. If this TLV is present, it carries the
    IPv6 MTU that SHOULD be compared with the local IPv6 MTU. If this TLV
    is absent, the minimum IPv6 MTU of 1280 octets SHOULD be used for
    the comparison (refer to <xref target="IPV6"/>).</t>

<t>If the M6-bit is set in a received Database Description packet for a
    non-IPv6 address family, the receiving router MUST NOT check the
    Interface MTU in the Database Description packet against the receiving
    interface's IPv6 MTU.</t>

octets 20-23 of the OSPFv3 Database Description packet:

<t>Only one instance of the IPv6 MTU TLV MAY appear in the LLS block.

inconsistency SHOULD be logged. 
</t>
</section>
<section title="Operation over Virtual Links">
  <t>OSPFv3 control packets sent over a virtual link are IPv6 packets and
   may traverse multiple hops. Therefore, there MUST be a global IPv6
   address associated with the virtual link so that OSPFv3 control
   packets are forwarded correctly by the intermediate hops between virtual link
   endpoints. Although this requirement can be satisfied in IPv6 unicast
   AFs, it will not function in other AFs as there will not be a routable
   global IPv6 address or forwarding path.  Therefore,
   virtual links are not supported in AFs other than IPv6 unicast.</t>
</section>
</section>
<section title="Backward Compatibility">
   <t>All modifications to OSPFv3 apply exclusively to the support of 
      address families other than the IPv6 unicast AF using multiple OSPFv3
      instances as described in this specification. These modifications are not
      applicable to IPv6 unicast topologies and do not preclude
      future single instance mechanisms for supporting multiple address families.</t>
   <t>In this section, we will define a non-capable OSPFv3 router as one
   not supporting this specification. When multiple AFs are supported 
   as defined herein, each new AF will have a corresponding Instance ID and can
   interoperate with the existing non-capable OSPFv3 routers in an IPv6 unicast
   topology. Furthermore, when a non-capable OSPFv3 router uses an Instance ID that
   is reserved for a given AF, no adjacency will be formed with this router since
   the AF-bit in the Options field will be clear in its OSPFv3 Hello packets.
   Therefore, there are no backward compatibility
   issues. AFs can be gradually deployed without disturbing OSPFv3 routing domains
   with non-capable OSPFv3 routers.</t>
</section>
<section title="Security Considerations">                        
   <t>IPsec <xref target="IPsec"/> can be used for OSPFv3
       authentication and confidentiality as described in <xref
           target="OSPFV3-AUTH"/>. When multiple OSPFv3 instances use the same
interface, they all MUST use the same Security Association (SA), since the SA
selectors do not provide selection based on data in OSPFv3 Header fields (e.g.,
the Instance ID).  This
       restriction is documented in Section 8 of <xref
           target="OSPFV3-AUTH"/>.</t>
   <t>Security considerations for 
   OSPFv3 are covered in <xref target="OSPFV3"/>.</t>
</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">
   <t>The following IANA assignments were made from existing
       registries.
<list style="symbols">
   <t>The AF-bit was assigned from the OSPFv3 Options registry as defined in
       <xref target="AF"/>.</t>
<t>The M6-bit was assigned from the DD Packet Flags registry as defined in
<xref target="MTU"/></t>
<t>The TLV type (17) for the IPv6 MTU TLV was assigned from the OSPF LLS TLVs
registry.</t>
</list>
</t>
   <t>IANA created a new registry, "OSPFv3 Instance ID
       Address Family Values",  for assignment of the mapping of 
       OSPFv3 Instance IDs to address families when this
       specification is used to support multiple address families. Note that the 
       Instance ID field MAY be used 
       for applications other than the support of multiple address
       families. However, if it is being used for address families as
       described in this specification, the assignments herein SHOULD 
       be honored.
