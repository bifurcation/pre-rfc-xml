<section title='Introduction' anchor='introduction'>

<t>The <xref target='RFC3711'>Secure Real-time Transport Protocol</xref>
	specification provides confidentiality, message authentication, and
	replay protection for multimedia payloads sent using the
    <xref target='RFC3550'>Real-time Protocol (RTP)</xref>.  However, in order
	to preserve RTP header compression efficiency, SRTP provides only
	authentication and replay protection for the headers of RTP packets, not
	confidentiality.
</t>

<t>For the standard portions of an RTP header, providing only
  authentication and replay protection does not normally present
  a problem, as the information carried in an RTP header does not provide much
  information beyond that which an attacker could infer by observing the
  size and timing of RTP packets.  Thus, there is little need for
  confidentiality of the header information.</t>

<t>However, the security requirements can be different for information carried in
  RTP header extensions.  A number of recent proposals for header extensions
  using the mechanism described in <xref target='RFC5285'>"A General Mechanism for RTP Header
  Extensions"</xref> carry information for which confidentiality could
  be desired or essential.  Notably, two recent specifications
  (<xref target='RFC6464' />
  and <xref target='RFC6465' />) contain information about
  per-packet sound levels of the media data carried in the RTP payload
  and specify that exposing this information to an eavesdropper is unacceptable in
  many circumstances (as described in the Security
  Considerations sections of those RFCs).</t>

<t>This document, therefore, defines a mechanism by which encryption
  can be applied to RTP header extensions when they are
  transported using SRTP.  As an RTP sender may wish some extension
  information to be sent in the clear (for example, it may be useful
  for a network monitoring device to be aware
  of <xref target='RFC5450'>RTP transmission time offsets</xref>), this
  mechanism can be selectively applied to a subset of the header
  extension elements carried in an SRTP packet.</t>

<t>The mechanism defined by this document encrypts packets' header
  extensions using the same cryptographic algorithms and parameters as
  are used to encrypt the packets' RTP payloads.  This document
  defines how this is done for the encryption transforms defined in
  <xref target='RFC3711' />, <xref target='RFC5669' />, and
  <xref target='RFC6188' />, which are the SRTP encryption transforms defined by
  Standards Track RFCs at the time of this writing.  It also updates
  <xref target='RFC3711' /> to indicate that specifications of future
  SRTP encryption transforms must define how header extension
  encryption is to be performed.</t> 

</section>

<section title='Terminology'>

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", 
"SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", 
and "OPTIONAL" in this document
are to be interpreted as described in <xref
target='RFC2119'>RFC 2119</xref> and indicate requirement levels for
compliant implementations.</t>

</section>

<section title='Encryption Mechanism' anchor='mechanism'>

<t>Encrypted header extension elements are carried in the same manner
  as non-encrypted header extension elements, as defined by
  <xref target='RFC5285' />.  The one- or two-byte header of the
  extension elements is not encrypted, nor is any of the header extension padding.  If
  multiple different header extension elements are being encrypted,
  they have separate element identifier values, just as they would if
  they were not encrypted. Similarly, encrypted and non-encrypted
  header extension elements have separate identifier values.</t>

<t>Encrypted header extension elements are carried only in packets encrypted
  using the <xref target='RFC3711'>Secure Real-time Transport Protocol</xref>.
  To encrypt (or decrypt) encrypted header extension elements, an SRTP
  participant first uses the SRTP key derivation algorithm, specified
  in Section 4.3.1 of <xref target='RFC3711' />, to generate header
  encryption and header salting keys, using the same pseudorandom
  function family as is used for the key derivation for the SRTP
  session.  These keys are derived as follows:
  <list style="symbols">
	<t>k_he (SRTP header encryption): <![CDATA[<label>]]> = 0x06, n=n_e.</t>
	<t>k_hs (SRTP header salting key): <![CDATA[<label>]]> = 0x07, n=n_s.</t>
  </list>
  where n_e and n_s are from the cryptographic context: the same size
  encryption key and salting key are used as are used for the SRTP payload.
  Additionally, the same master key, master salt, index, and
  key_derivation_rate are used as for the SRTP payload.
  (Note that since RTP headers, including header extensions,
  are authenticated in SRTP, no new authentication key is needed for
  header extensions.)
</t>

<t>A header extension keystream is generated for each packet
  containing encrypted header extension elements.
  The details of how this header extension keystream is
  generated depend on the encryption transform that is used for the
  SRTP packet.  For encryption transforms that have been standardized
  as of the date of publication of this document, see
  <xref target='existing-transforms'/>; for requirements for new
  transforms, see <xref target='new-transforms'/>.
</t>

<t>After the header extension keystream is generated, the SRTP participant then
  computes an encryption mask for the
  header extension, identifying the portions of the header extension
  that are, or are to be, encrypted.
  (For an example of this procedure, see <xref target='example'/>.)
  This encryption mask corresponds
  to the entire payload of each header extension element that is
  encrypted.  It does not include any non-encrypted header extension
  elements, any extension element headers, or any padding octets.
  The encryption mask has all&nbhy;bits&nbhy;1 octets (i.e., hexadecimal 0xff) for
  header extension octets that are to be encrypted and all&nbhy;bits&nbhy;0
  octets for header extension octets that are not to 
  be encrypted.  The set of extension elements to be
  encrypted is communicated between the sender and the receiver using the
  signaling mechanisms described in <xref target='signaling' />.</t>

<t>This encryption mask is computed separately for every packet that
  carries a header extension.  Based on the non-encrypted portions of
  the headers and the signaled list of encrypted extension elements,
  a receiver can always determine the correct encryption mask for any
  encrypted header extension.</t>

<t>The SRTP participant bitwise-ANDs the encryption mask with the keystream to
  produce a masked keystream.  It then bitwise exclusive-ORs the
  header extension with this masked keystream to produce the
  ciphertext version of the header extension.  
  (Thus, octets indicated as all&nbhy;bits&nbhy;1 in the encrypted mask are encrypted,
  whereas those indicated as all&nbhy;bits&nbhy;0 are not.)</t>

<t>The header extension encryption process does not include the
  "defined by profile" or "length" fields of the header extension,
  only the field that Section 5.3.1 of <xref target='RFC3550'/> calls
  "header extension" proper, starting with the first
  <xref target='RFC5285'/> ID and length.  Thus, both the encryption
  mask and the keystream begin at this point.</t>

<t>This header extension encryption process could, equivalently, be
  computed by considering the encryption mask as a mixture of the
  encrypted and unencrypted headers, i.e., as

<figure>
<artwork>
    EncryptedHeader = (Encrypt(Key, Plaintext) AND MASK) OR
                      (Plaintext AND (NOT MASK))
</artwork></figure>

  where Encrypt is the encryption function, MASK is the encryption
  mask, and AND, OR, and NOT are bitwise operations.  This formulation
  of the encryption process might be preferred by implementations for
  which encryption is performed by a separate module and cannot
  be modified easily.</t>

<t>The SRTP authentication tag is computed across the encrypted
 header extension, i.e., the data that is actually transmitted on
 the wire.  Thus, header extension encryption MUST be done before the
 authentication tag is computed, and authentication tag validation
 MUST be done on the encrypted header extensions.  For receivers,
 header extension decryption SHOULD be done only after the receiver
 has validated the packet's message authentication tag, and the
 receiver MUST NOT take any actions based on decrypted headers, prior to
 validating the authentication tag, that
 could affect the security or proper functioning of the system.</t>


<section title='Example Encryption Mask' anchor='example'>

<t>If a sender wished to send a header extension containing an encrypted
  <xref target='RFC5484'>SMPTE timecode</xref> with ID 1, a
  plaintext <xref target='RFC5450'>transmission time offset</xref>
  with ID 2, an encrypted

  the plaintext RTP header
  extension might look like this:</t>

  the header extension keystream SHALL be generated for each packet

<t>For the <xref target='RFC5669'>SEED-CCM and SEED-GCM transforms</xref>,
  the header extension keystream SHALL be
  generated using the algorithm specified above for the
  SEED-CTR algorithm.  (Because the Authenticated Encryption with
  Associated Data (AEAD) transform used on the payload
  in these algorithms includes the RTP header, including the RTP
  header extension, in its Associated Authenticated Data (AAD), 
  counter-mode encryption for the header extension is believed to be
  of equivalent cryptographic strength to the CCM and GCM transforms.)</t>

<t>For the <xref target='RFC3711'>NULL encryption transform</xref>,
  the header extension keystream SHALL be all-zero.</t>

</section>

<section title='Header Extension Keystream Generation for Future

<t>When new SRTP encryption transforms are defined, this document
  updates <xref target='RFC3711'/> as follows: in addition
  to the rules specified in Section 6 of RFC 3711, the Standards Track
  RFC defining the new transform MUST specify how the encryption
  transform is to be used with header extension encryption.</t>

<t>It is RECOMMENDED that new transformations follow the same
  mechanisms as are defined in <xref target='existing-transforms'/> of this document
  if they are applicable and are believed to be cryptographically
  adequate for the transform in question.</t>

<section title='Signaling (Setup) Information' anchor='signaling'>

<t>Encrypted header extension elements are signaled in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) extmap
  attribute using the URI "urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:encrypt"
  followed by the URI of the header extension element being encrypted,
  as well as any extensionattributes that extension normally takes.

  <xref target='encrypt_grammar' /> gives a
  formal <xref target='RFC5234'>Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)</xref>
  showing this grammar extension, extending the grammar defined in
  <xref target='RFC5285'/>.</t>

<t>This example uses <xref target='RFC4568'>SDP security
	descriptions</xref> for SRTP keying, but this is merely for
	illustration. Any SRTP keying mechanism to establish session keys
	will work.</t>

<t>The extmap SDP attribute is defined in <xref target='RFC5285' /> as
  being either a session or media attribute.  If the extmap for an
  encrypted header extension is specified as a media attribute, it
  MUST be specified only for media that use SRTP-based RTP profiles.
  If such an extmap is specified as a session attribute, there MUST be
  at least one media in the SDP session that uses an SRTP-based RTP
  profile. The session-level extmap applies to all the SRTP-based
  media in the session and MUST be ignored for all other (non-SRTP or
  non-RTP) media.</t>

<t>The "urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:encrypt" extension MUST NOT be
  recursively applied to itself.</t>

<section title='Backward Compatibility'>

<t>Following the procedures in <xref target='RFC5285' />, an SDP
   endpoint that does not understand the
   "urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:encrypt" extension URI will ignore the
   extension and, for SDP offer/answer, will negotiate not to use it.</t>

<t>For backward compatibility with endpoints that do not implement
  this specification, in a negotiated session (whether using
  offer/answer or some other means), best-effort encryption of a
  header extension element is possible: an endpoint MAY offer the same
  header extension element both encrypted and unencrypted.  An offerer
  MUST offer only best-effort negotiation when lack of confidentiality
  would be acceptable in the backward-compatible case.  Answerers (or
  equivalent peers in a negotiation) that understand header extension
  encryption SHOULD choose the encrypted form of the offered header
  extension element and mark the unencrypted form "inactive", unless
  they have an explicit reason to prefer the unencrypted form.  In all
  cases, answerers MUST NOT negotiate the use of, and senders MUST NOT
  send, both encrypted and unencrypted forms of the same header
  extension.</t>

<t>Note that, as always, users of
  best-effort encryption MUST be cautious of bid-down attacks, where a
  man-in-the-middle attacker removes a higher-security option, forcing
  endpoints to negotiate a lower-security one.  Appropriate
  countermeasures depend on the signaling protocol in use, but users
  can ensure, for example, that signaling is integrity-protected.</t>


</section>

</section>

<section title='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>

<t>The security properties of header extension elements protected by the
  mechanism in this document
  are equivalent to those for SRTP payloads.</t>

<t>The mechanism defined in this document does not provide
  confidentiality about which header extension elements are used for a
  given SRTP packet, only for the content of those header extension
  elements.  This appears to be in the spirit of SRTP itself, which
  does not encrypt RTP headers.  If this is a concern, an alternate
  mechanism would be needed to provide confidentiality.</t>


<t>For the two-byte-header form of header extension elements (0x100N, where "N" is the appbits field),
  this mechanism does not provide any protection to zero-length header
  extension elements (for which their presence or absence is the only
  information they carry).  It also does not provide any protection
  for the appbits (field 256, the lowest four bits of the
  "defined by profile" field) of the two-byte headers.  Neither of these features is present in
  the one-byte-header form of header extension elements (0xBEDE), so
  these limitations do not apply in that case.</t>

<t>This mechanism cannot protect RTP header extensions that do not
  use the mechanism defined in <xref target='RFC5285' />.</t>

<t>This document does not specify the circumstances in which extension
  header encryption should be used.  Documents defining specific
  header extension elements should provide guidance on when encryption
  is appropriate for these elements.</t>

<t>If a middlebox does not have access to the SRTP authentication
  keys, it has no way to verify the authenticity of unencrypted RTP
  header extension elements (or the unencrypted RTP header), even
  though it can monitor them.  Therefore, such middleboxes MUST treat
  such headers as untrusted and potentially generated by an attacker,
  in the same way as they treat unauthenticated traffic.  (This does not mean
  that middleboxes cannot view and interpret such traffic, of course,
  only that appropriate skepticism needs to be maintained about the
  results of such interpretation.)</t>

<t>There is no mechanism defined to protect header extensions with
  different algorithms or encryption keys than are used to protect the
  RTP payloads.  In particular, it is not possible to provide
  confidentiality for a header extension while leaving the payload in
  cleartext.</t>

<t>The dangers of using weak or NULL authentication with SRTP,
  described in Section 9.5 of <xref target='RFC3711' />, apply to
  encrypted header extensions as well.  In particular, since some
  header extension elements will have some easily guessed plaintext
  bits, strong authentication is REQUIRED if an attacker setting such
  bits could have a meaningful effect on the behavior of the
  system.</t>

<t>The technique defined in this document can be applied only to
  encryption transforms that work by generating a pseudorandom
  keystream and bitwise exclusive-ORing it with the plaintext, such as
  CTR or f8.  It will not work with ECB, CBC, or any other
  encryption method that does not use a keystream.</t>

<section title='Test Vectors'>

<section title='Key Derivation Test Vectors' anchor='kdatestvect'>

<t>This section provides test data for the header extension key derivation
   function, using AES-128 in Counter Mode.  (The algorithms and keys
   used are the same as those for the test vectors in Appendix B.3 of
   <xref target='RFC3711' />.)</t>

<t>The inputs to the key derivation function are the 16-octet master key
   and the 14-octet master salt:

<list style='empty'>
  <t>master key:  E1F97A0D3E018BE0D64FA32C06DE4139</t>
  <t>master salt: 0EC675AD498AFEEBB6960B3AABE6</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>Following <xref target='RFC3711'/>, the input block for
   AES-CM is generated by exclusive-ORing the master salt with the
   concatenation of the encryption key label 0x06 with (index DIV kdr),
   then padding on the right with two null octets, which implements the
   multiply-by-2^16 operation (see Section 4.3.3
   of <xref target='RFC3711' />).  The resulting value
   is then AES-CM-encrypted using the master key to get the cipher
   key.</t>

<t>Next, we show how the cipher salt is generated.  The input block for
   AES-CM is generated by exclusive-ORing the master salt with the
   concatenation of the encryption salt label.  That value is padded and
   encrypted as above.</t>

<section title='Header Encryption Test Vectors Using AES-CM'>

<t>This section provides test vectors for the encryption of a header
  extension using the AES_CM cryptographic transform.</t>

<t>The header extension is encrypted using the header cipher
  key and header cipher salt computed in <xref target='kdatestvect'
  />.  The header extension is carried in an SRTP-encrypted RTP packet
  with SSRC 0xCAFEBABE, sequence number 0x1234, and an all-zero
  rollover counter.</t>

    Session Key:      549752054D6FB708622C4A2E596A1B93
    Session Salt:     AB01818174C40D39A3781F7C2D27

    SSRC:                     CAFEBABE
    Rollover Counter:                 00000000
    Sequence Number:                          1234

<t>The SRTP session was negotiated to indicate that header extension
  ID values 1, 3, and 4 are encrypted.</t>

<t>In hexadecimal, the header extension being encrypted is as follows (spaces
  have been added to show the internal structure of the header extension):</t>

<t>This header extension is 24 bytes long.  (Its values are intended
  to represent plausible values of the header extension elements shown
  in <xref target='example' />, but their specific meaning is not
  important for the example.)  The header extension "defined by
  profile" and "length" fields, which in this case are BEDE 0006
  in hexadecimal, are not included in the encryption process.</t> 

<t>In hexadecimal, the corresponding encryption mask selecting the
  bodies of header extensions 1, 2, and 4 (corresponding to the mask
  in <xref target='mask' />) is:</t>

   00 FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF 00 000000 00 FF 00 FFFFFFFFFFFFFF 00

</figure>

<t>Finally, we compute the keystream from the session key and the
  initial counter, apply the mask to the keystream, and then exclusive-OR the
  keystream with the plaintext:</t>
