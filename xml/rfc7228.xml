<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Small devices with limited CPU, memory, and power resources, so-called
"constrained devices" (often used as sensors/actuators, smart objects,
or smart devices) can
form a network, becoming "constrained nodes" in that network.
Such a network may itself exhibit constraints, e.g., with unreliable or
lossy channels, limited and unpredictable bandwidth, and a highly
dynamic topology.</t>

<t>Constrained devices might be in charge of gathering information in
diverse settings, including natural ecosystems, buildings, and
factories, and sending the information to one or more server stations.
They might also act on information, by performing some
physical action, including displaying it.
Constrained devices may work under severe resource constraints such
as limited battery and computing power, little memory, and
insufficient wireless bandwidth and ability to communicate; these
constraints often exacerbate each other.
Other entities on the network, e.g., a base station or controlling
server, might have more computational and communication resources and
could support the interaction between the constrained devices and
applications in more traditional networks.</t>



<t>Today, diverse sizes of constrained devices with different resources
and capabilities are becoming connected.  Mobile personal gadgets,
building-automation devices, cellular phones, machine-to-machine (M2M)
devices, and other devices benefit from interacting with other "things" nearby
or somewhere in the Internet.  With this, the Internet of Things (IoT)
becomes a reality, built up out of uniquely identifiable and
addressable objects (things).  Over the next decade, this could
grow to large numbers <xref target="FIFTY-BILLION"/> of Internet-connected constrained
devices, greatly increasing the Internet's size and scope.</t>

<t>The present document provides a number of basic terms that have 
been useful in the standardization work for constrained
environments.  The intention is not to exhaustively cover the field
but to make sure a few core terms are used consistently between
different groups cooperating in this space.</t>

<t>In this document, the term "byte" is used in its now customary sense
as a synonym for "octet".  Where sizes of semiconductor memory are
given, the prefix "kibi" (1024) is combined with "byte" to "kibibyte",
abbreviated "KiB", for 1024 bytes <xref target="ISQ-13"/>.</t>

<t>In computing, the term "power" is often used for the concept of
"computing power" or "processing power", as in CPU performance.
In this document, the term stands
for electrical power unless explicitly stated otherwise.  "Mains-powered" is used as a shorthand for
being permanently connected to a stable electrical power grid.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="core-terminology" title="Core Terminology">

<t>There are two important aspects to <spanx style="emph">scaling</spanx> within the Internet of Things:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>scaling up Internet technologies to a large number <xref target="FIFTY-BILLION"/> of
inexpensive nodes, while</t>
  <t>scaling down the characteristics of each of these nodes and of the
networks being built out of them, to make this scaling up economically
and physically viable.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The need for scaling down the characteristics of nodes leads to
"constrained nodes".</t>

<section anchor="constrained-nodes" title="Constrained Nodes">

<t>The term "constrained node" is best defined by contrasting the
characteristics of a constrained node with certain widely held
expectations on more familiar Internet nodes:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='Constrained Node:'>
  A node where some of the characteristics that are otherwise pretty
much taken for granted for Internet nodes at the time of writing are not
attainable, often due to cost constraints and/or physical
constraints on characteristics such as size, weight, and available
power and energy.
The tight limits on power, memory, and processing resources lead to
hard upper bounds on state, code space, and processing cycles, making
optimization of energy and network bandwidth usage a dominating
consideration in all design
requirements.  Also, some layer-2 services such as full connectivity
and broadcast/multicast may be lacking.</t>
</list></t>

<t>While this is not a rigorous definition, it is
grounded in the state of the art and clearly sets apart constrained
nodes from server systems, desktop or laptop computers, powerful
mobile devices such as smartphones, etc.  There may be many design
considerations that lead to these constraints, including cost, size,
weight, and other scaling factors.</t>

<t>(An alternative term, when the properties as a network node are not in
focus, is "constrained device".)</t>

<t>There are multiple facets to the constraints on nodes, often applying
in combination, for example:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>constraints on the maximum code complexity (ROM/Flash),</t>
  <t>constraints on the size of state and buffers (RAM),</t>
  <t>constraints on the amount of computation feasible in a period of
time ("processing power"),</t>
  <t>constraints on the available power, and</t>
  <t>constraints on user interface and accessibility in deployment
(ability to set keys, update software, etc.).</t>
</list></t>

<t><xref target="devclass"/> defines a small number of interesting classes ("class-N"
for N = 0, 1, 2) of constrained nodes focusing on relevant combinations of
the first two constraints.
With respect to available power, <xref target="RFC6606"/> distinguishes
"power-affluent" nodes (mains-powered or regularly recharged) from
"power-constrained nodes" that draw their power from primary batteries
or by using energy harvesting; more detailed power terminology is
given in <xref target="power"/>.</t>

<t>The use of constrained nodes in networks often also leads to
constraints on the networks themselves.  However, there may also be
constraints on networks that are largely independent from those of the
nodes.  We therefore distinguish "constrained networks" from
"constrained-node networks".</t>


</section>
<section anchor="constrained-networks" title="Constrained Networks">

<t>We define "constrained network" in a similar way:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='Constrained Network:'>
  A network where some of the characteristics pretty much taken for
granted with link layers in common use in the Internet at the time
of writing are
not attainable.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Constraints may include:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>low achievable bitrate/throughput (including limits on duty cycle),</t>
  <t>high packet loss and high variability of packet loss (delivery rate),</t>
  <t>highly asymmetric link characteristics,</t>
  <t>severe penalties for using larger packets (e.g., high packet loss
due to link-layer fragmentation),</t>
  <t>limits on reachability over time (a substantial number of devices
may power off at any point in time but periodically "wake up" and
can communicate for brief periods of time), and</t>
  <t>lack of (or severe constraints on) advanced services such as IP multicast.</t>
</list></t>

<t>More generally, we speak of constrained networks whenever at least
some of the nodes involved in the network exhibit these
characteristics.</t>

<t>Again, there may be several reasons for this:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>cost constraints on the network,</t>
  <t>constraints posed by the nodes (for constrained-node networks),</t>
  <t>physical constraints (e.g., power constraints, environmental
constraints, media constraints
such as underwater operation, limited spectrum for very high
density, electromagnetic compatibility),</t>
  <t>regulatory constraints, such as very limited spectrum availability
(including limits on effective radiated power and duty cycle) or
explosion safety, and</t>
  <t>technology constraints, such as older and lower-speed technologies that
are still operational and may need to stay in use for some more time.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="challenged-networks" title="Challenged Networks">

<t>A constrained network is not necessarily a "challenged network" <xref target="FALL"/>:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='Challenged Network:'>
  A network that has serious trouble maintaining what an application
would today expect of the end-to-end IP model, e.g., by:

<list style="symbols">
  <t>not being able to offer end-to-end IP connectivity at all,</t>
  <t>exhibiting serious interruptions in end-to-end IP connectivity, or</t>
  <t>exhibiting delay well beyond the Maximum Segment Lifetime (MSL)
defined by TCP <xref target="RFC0793"/>.
</t>
</list></t>


</list>

</t>



<t>All challenged networks are constrained networks in some sense, but
not all constrained networks are challenged networks.  There is no
well-defined boundary between the two, though.  Delay-Tolerant
Networking (DTN) has been designed to cope with challenged networks
<xref target="RFC4838"/>.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="constrained-node-networks" title="Constrained-Node Networks">

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='Constrained-Node Network:'>
  A network whose characteristics are influenced by being composed of
a significant portion of constrained nodes.</t>
</list></t>

<t>A constrained-node network always is a constrained network because of
the network constraints stemming from the node constraints, but it may
also have other constraints that already make it a constrained network.</t>

<t>The rest of this subsection introduces two additional terms that are
in active use in the area of constrained-node networks, without an
intent to define them: LLN and (6)LoWPAN.</t>

<section anchor="lln-low-power-lossy-network" title="LLN">

<t>A related term that has been used to describe the focus of the IETF
ROLL working group is
"Low-Power and Lossy Network (LLN)".  The ROLL (Routing Over Low-Power and
Lossy) terminology document
<xref target="RFC7102"/> defines LLNs as follows:</t>

<t><list style='empty'>
  <t>
   LLN: Low-Power and Lossy Network.  Typically composed of many
      embedded devices with limited power, memory, and processing
      resources interconnected by a variety of links, such as IEEE
      802.15.4 or low-power Wi-Fi.  There is a wide scope of application
      areas for LLNs, including industrial monitoring, building
      automation (heating,
      ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), lighting, access control, fire), connected home,
      health care, environmental monitoring, urban sensor networks,
      energy management, assets tracking, and refrigeration.
</t>
</list></t>

<t>Beyond that, LLNs often exhibit considerable loss at the
physical layer, with significant variability of the delivery rate,
and some short-term unreliability, coupled with some medium-term
stability that makes it worthwhile to both construct directed acyclic graphs that are medium-term stable for routing and do measurements on the edges
such as Expected Transmission Count (ETX) <xref target="RFC6551"/>.  Not all LLNs comprise low-power nodes
<xref target="RPL-DEPLOYMENT"/>.</t>


<t>LLNs typically are composed
of constrained nodes; this leads to the design of
operation modes such as the "non-storing mode" defined by RPL (the
IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks <xref target="RFC6550"/>).  So, in the
terminology of the present document, an LLN is a constrained-node network with
certain network characteristics, which include
constraints on the network as well.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="lowpan-6lowpan" title="LoWPAN, 6LoWPAN">

<t>One interesting class of a constrained network often used as a
constrained-node network is "LoWPAN" <xref target="RFC4919"/>, a term inspired
from the name of an IEEE 802.15.4 working group (low-rate wireless
personal area networks (LR-WPANs)).  The expansion of the LoWPAN acronym,
"Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network", contains a hard-to-justify
"Personal" that is due to the history of task group naming in IEEE 802
more than due to an
orientation of LoWPANs around a single person.  Actually, LoWPANs have
been suggested for urban monitoring, control of large buildings, and
industrial control applications, so the "Personal" can only be
considered a vestige.  Occasionally, the term is read as "Low-Power
Wireless Area Networks" <xref target="WEI"/>.  Originally focused on IEEE
802.15.4, "LoWPAN" (or when used for IPv6, "6LoWPAN") also refers to
networks built from similarly constrained link-layer
technologies <xref target="V6-BTLE"/> <xref target="V6-DECT-ULE"/> <xref target="V6-G9959"/>.</t>

</section>
</section>
</section>
<section anchor="devclass" title="Classes of Constrained Devices">

<t>Despite the overwhelming variety of Internet-connected devices that
can be envisioned, it may be worthwhile to have some succinct
terminology for different classes of constrained devices.  In this
document, the class designations in <xref target="devclasstbl"/> may be used as rough
indications of device capabilities:</t>
<?rfc compact="no"?>
<texttable title="Classes of Constrained Devices (KiB = 1024 bytes)" anchor="devclasstbl">
      <ttcol align='left'>Name</ttcol>
      <ttcol align='left'>data size (e.g., RAM)</ttcol>
      <ttcol align='left'>code size (e.g., Flash)</ttcol>
      <c>Class 0, C0</c>
      <c>&lt;&lt; 10 KiB</c>
      <c>&lt;&lt; 100 KiB</c>
      <c>Class 1, C1</c>
      <c>~ 10 KiB</c>
      <c>~ 100 KiB</c>
      <c>Class 2, C2</c>
      <c>~ 50 KiB</c>
      <c>~ 250 KiB</c>
</texttable>
<?rfc compact="yes"?>
<t>As of the writing of this document, these characteristics correspond
to distinguishable clusters of commercially available chips and design
cores for constrained devices.  While it is expected that the
boundaries of these classes will move over time, Moore's law tends to
be less effective in the embedded space than in personal computing
devices: gains made available by increases in transistor count and
density are more likely to be invested in reductions of cost and power
requirements than into continual increases in computing power.</t>


<t>Class 0 devices are very constrained sensor-like motes.  They are so
severely constrained in memory and processing capabilities that most
likely they will not have the resources required to communicate
directly with the Internet in a secure manner (rare heroic, narrowly
targeted implementation efforts
notwithstanding).  Class 0 devices will participate in Internet
communications with the help of larger devices acting as proxies,
gateways, or servers.  Class 0 devices generally cannot be secured or managed
comprehensively in the traditional sense.  They will most likely be
preconfigured (and will be reconfigured rarely, if at all) with a very
small data set.  For management purposes, they could answer keepalive
signals and send on/off or basic health indications.</t>


<t>Class 1 devices are quite constrained in code space and processing
capabilities, such that they
cannot easily talk to other Internet nodes employing a
full protocol stack such as using HTTP, Transport Layer Security (TLS), and related security
protocols and XML-based data representations.  
However, they are capable enough to
use a protocol stack specifically designed for
constrained nodes (such as the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) over UDP <xref target="COAP"/>) and participate in meaningful
conversations without the help of a gateway node.  In particular, they
can provide support for the security functions required on a large
network.  Therefore, they can be integrated as fully developed peers
into an IP network, but they need to be parsimonious with state
memory, code space, and often power expenditure for protocol and
application usage.</t>

<t>Class 2 devices are less constrained and fundamentally capable of
supporting most of the same protocol stacks as used on
notebooks or servers.  However, even these devices can benefit from
lightweight and energy-efficient protocols and from consuming less
bandwidth.  Furthermore, using fewer resources for networking leaves
more resources available to applications.  Thus, using the protocol
stacks defined for more constrained devices on Class 2 devices
might reduce development costs and increase the interoperability.</t>

<t>Constrained devices with capabilities significantly beyond Class 2
devices exist.  They are less demanding from a standards development
point of view as they can largely use existing protocols unchanged.
The present document therefore does not make any attempt to define
classes beyond Class 2.  These devices can still be constrained by a
limited energy supply.</t>

<t>With respect to examining the capabilities of constrained nodes,
particularly for Class 1 devices, it is important to understand what
type of applications they are able to run and which protocol
mechanisms would be most suitable.  Because of memory and other
limitations, each specific Class 1 device might be able to support
only a few selected functions needed for its intended operation.  In
other words, the set of functions that can actually be supported is
not static per device type: devices with similar constraints might
choose to support different functions.  Even though Class 2 devices
have some more functionality available and may be able to provide a
more complete set of functions, they still need to be assessed for the
type of applications they will be running and the protocol functions
they would need.  To be able to derive any requirements, the use
cases and the involvement of the devices in the application and the
operational scenario need to be analyzed.  Use cases may combine
constrained devices of multiple classes as well as more traditional
Internet nodes.

<section anchor="power" title="Power Terminology">

<t>Devices not only differ in their computing capabilities but also in
available power and/or energy.  While it is harder to find
recognizable clusters in this space, it is still useful to introduce
some common terminology.</t>

<section anchor="scaling-properties" title="Scaling Properties">

<t>The power and/or energy available to a device may vastly differ, from
kilowatts to microwatts, from essentially unlimited to hundreds of
microjoules.</t>

<t>Instead of defining classes or clusters, we simply state, using
the International System of Units (SI units), an approximate value for one or both of the quantities
listed in <xref target="scaletbl"/>:</t>
<?rfc compact="no" ?>
<texttable title="Quantities Relevant to Power and Energy" anchor="scaletbl">

<?rfc compact="yes"?>
<t>The value of Et may need to be interpreted in conjunction with an
indication over which period of time the value is given; see <xref target="classes-of-energy-limitation"/>.</t>

<t>Some devices enter a "low-power" mode before the energy available in a
period is exhausted or even have multiple such steps on the way to
exhaustion.  For these devices, Ps would need to be given for each of
the modes/steps.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="classes-of-energy-limitation" title="Classes of Energy Limitation">

<t>As discussed above, some devices are limited in available energy as
opposed to (or in addition to) being limited in available power.
Where no relevant limitations exist with respect to energy, the device
is classified as E9.
The energy limitation may be in total energy available in the usable
lifetime of the device
(e.g., a device that is discarded when its 
non-replaceable primary battery is exhausted),
classified as E2.
Where the relevant limitation is for a specific period, the device is                                                       classified as E1, e.g., a solar-powered device with a limited amount of 
energy available for the night, a device that is manually connected to a 
charger and has a period of time between recharges, or a device with a                                                      periodic (primary) battery replacement interval. 
Finally, there may be a limited amount of energy available for a specific
event, e.g., for a button press in an energy-harvesting light switch;
such devices are classified as E0.
Note that, in a sense, many E1 devices are also E2, as the rechargeable
battery has a limited number of useful recharging cycles.</t>

<section anchor="poweruse" title="Strategies for Using Power for Communication">

<t>Especially when wireless transmission is used, the radio often
consumes a big portion of the total energy consumed by the device.
Design parameters, such as the available spectrum, the desired range,
and the bitrate aimed for,
influence the power consumed during transmission and reception; the
duration of transmission and reception (including potential reception)
influence the total energy consumption.</t>

<t>Different 
strategies for power usage and network attachment may be used, based on the type of the energy source (e.g., battery or mains-powered)
and the frequency with which a device needs to communicate. </t>

<t>The general strategies for power usage can be described as follows:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='Always-on:'>
  This strategy is most applicable if there is no reason for extreme
measures for power saving.  The device can stay on in the usual manner
all the time.  It may be useful to employ power-friendly hardware or
limit the number of wireless transmissions, CPU speeds, and other
aspects for general power-saving and cooling needs, but the device can
be connected to the network all the time.</t>
  <t hangText='Normally-off:'>
  Under this strategy, the device sleeps such long periods at a time
that once it wakes up, it makes sense for it to not pretend that it
has been connected to the network during sleep: the device reattaches
to the network as it is woken up.  The main optimization goal is to
minimize the effort during the reattachment process and any
resulting application communications.</t>
  <t>If the device sleeps for long periods of time and needs to
communicate infrequently, the relative increase in energy expenditure
during reattachment may be acceptable.</t>
  <t hangText='Low-power:'>
  This strategy is most applicable to devices that need to operate on
a very small amount of power but still need to be able to communicate
on a relatively frequent basis. This implies that extremely low-power
solutions need to be used for the hardware, chosen link-layer
mechanisms, and so on.  Typically, given the small amount of time
between transmissions, despite their sleep state, these devices retain
some form of attachment to the network.  Techniques used for
minimizing power usage for the network communications include
minimizing any work from re-establishing communications after waking
up and tuning the frequency of communications (including "duty cycling",
where components are switched on and off in a regular cycle) and other parameters
appropriately.</t>

a Non-Sleepy Node as a node that always remains in a fully powered-on

into a sleep mode (a low-power state to conserve power) and

<t>This document introduces common terminology that does not raise any
new security issues.  Security considerations arising from the
constraints discussed in this document need to be discussed in the
context of specific protocols.  For instance, Section 11.6 of <xref target="COAP"/>,
"Constrained node considerations", discusses implications of specific
constraints on the security mechanisms employed.
<xref target="ROLL-SEC-THREATS"/> provides a security
threat analysis for the RPL routing protocol.
Implementation considerations for security protocols on constrained
nodes are discussed in <xref target="IKEV2-MINIMAL"/> and
<xref target="TLS-MINIMAL"/>.
A wider view of security in constrained-node networks is provided in
<xref target="IOT-SECURITY"/>.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="acknowledgements" title="Acknowledgements">

<t>Dominique Barthel and Peter van der Stok provided useful comments;
Charles Palmer provided a full editorial review.</t>

<t>Peter van der Stok insisted that we should include power terminology,
hence <xref target="power"/>.
The text for <xref target="poweruse"/> is mostly lifted from a previous version of
<xref target="COAP-CELLULAR"/> and has been adapted for this document.</t>
