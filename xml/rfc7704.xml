        <abstract>
            <t>The process of producing today's Internet technologies through a
                culture of open participation and diverse collaboration has
                proved strikingly efficient and effective, and it is distinctive
                among standards organizations. During the early years of the
		IETF and its antecedent,
                participation was almost entirely
                composed of a small group of well-funded, American, white, male
                technicians, demonstrating a distinctive and challenging group
                dynamic, both in management and in personal interactions. In the
                case of the IETF, interaction style can often contain singularly
                aggressive behavior, often including singularly hostile tone and
                content. Groups with greater diversity make better decisions.
                Obtaining meaningful diversity requires more than generic good
                will and statements of principle. Many different behaviors can
                serve to reduce participant diversity or participation
                diversity. This document discusses IETF participation in terms
                of the nature of diversity and practical issues that can
                increase or decrease it. The document represents the authors'

        <section title="Introduction">

            <t>This document discusses IETF participation, in terms of the
                nature of diversity and practical issues that can increase or
                decrease it. The topic has received recent discussion in the
                IETF, and the document represents the authors' assessments and
                recommendations about it, in the belief that it is constructive
                for the IETF and that it is consonant with at least some of the
                IETF community's participants. </t>

            <t>The Internet Engineering Task Force <xref target="IETF"/> grew
                out of a research effort that was started in the late 1960s,
                with central funding by the US Department of Defense Advanced
                Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later DARPA) employing a
                collection of research sites around the United States, and
                including some participation by groups of the US military. The
                community was originally restricted to participation by members
                of the funded research groups. In the 1980s, participation
                expanded to include projects funded by other agencies, most
                notably the US National Science Foundation for its NSFNet
                effort. At around the time the IETF was created in its current
                form, in the late 1980s, participation in the group became fully
                open, permitting attendance by anyone, independent of funding,
                affiliation, country of origin, or the like.</t>

            <t>Beyond the obvious effects of the resulting technology that we
                now enjoy, the process of producing today's Internet
                technologies through a culture of open participation and diverse
                collaboration has proved strikingly efficient and effective, and
                it is distinctive among standards organizations. This culture
                has been sustained across many changes in participant origins,
                organizational structures, economic cycles, and formal
                processes. However, maintenance of the IETF's effectiveness
                requires constant vigilance. As new participants join the IETF
                mix, it is increasingly easy for the IETF's operation to
                gradually invoke models from other environments, which are more
                established and more familiar, but often are less effective.</t>

            <t>Historically, participation in the IETF and its antecedent was
                almost entirely composed of a small group of well-funded,
                American, white, male technicians. No matter the intentions of
                the participants, such a narrow demographic demonstrated a
                distinctive group dynamic, both in management and in personal
                interactions, that persists into the current IETF. Aggressive
                and even hostile discussion behavior is quite common. In terms
                of management, the IETF can be significantly in-bred, favoring
                selection of those who are already well-known. Of course, the
                pool of candidates from which selections are made suffer classic
                limitations of diversity found in many engineering environments.
                Still, there is evidence and perception of selection bias, beyond
                this.</t>

            <t>In the case of the IETF, the style of interaction can often
                demonstrate singularly aggressive behavior, including singularly
                hostile tone and content. In most professional venues, such
                behavior is deemed highly unprofessional, or worse. Within the
                IETF, such behavior has had long-standing tolerance. Criticizing
                someone's hostility is dismissed by saying that's just the way
                they are, or that someone else provoked it, or that the person
                is generally well-intentioned. Further, anyone expressing concern
                about the behavior is typically admonished to be less sensitive;
                that is, a recipient of an attack who then complains is often
                criticized or dismissed.</t>

            <t>As the IETF opened its doors to participation by anyone, its
                demographics have predictably moved towards much greater
                variety. However, the group culture has not adapted to
                accommodate these changes. The aggressive debating style and the
                tolerance for personal attacks can be extremely off-putting for
                participants from more polite cultures. And, the management
                selection processes can tend to exclude some constituencies
                inappropriately.</t>

            <t>Recently, members of an informal IETF women's interest group,
                called "systers", organized a quiet experiment, putting forward
                a large number of women candidates for management positions,
                through the IETF's "NomCom" process. NomCom is itself a
                potentially diverse group of IETF participants, chosen at random
                from a pool of recent meeting attendees who offer their
                services. Hence, its problematic choices -- or rather, omissions
                -- could be seen as reflecting IETF culture generally.</t>

            <t>Over the years, some women have been chosen for IETF positions as
                authors, working group chairs, area directors, Internet
                Architecture Board <xref target="IAB"/> members, and IETF
                Administrative Oversight Committee <xref target="IAOC"/> members.
                However, the results of the systers experiment were not
                encouraging. In spite of their recruiting a disproportionately
                high number of female candidates, not a single one was selected.
                Although any one candidate might be rejected for entirely
                legitimate reasons, a pattern of rejection this consistent
                suggested an organizational bias. The results were presented at
                an IETF plenary, and they engendered significant IETF
                soul-searching, as well as creation of a group to consider
                diversity issues for the IETF <xref target="Div-DT"/> <xref
                    target="Div-Discuss"/>.</t>

            <t>Other activities around that same time also engendered IETF
                consideration of unacceptable behaviors, generally classed as
                harassment. This resulted in the IESG's issuing a formal IETF
                anti-harassment policy <xref target="Anti-Harass"/>.
            </t>

            <t>Changing an organization's culture is difficult and requires not
                only commitment to the underlying principles, but also vigilant
                and sustained effort. The IESG has taken essential first steps.
                What is needed is going beyond the position papers and
                expression of ideals, into continuing education of the entire
                community, and immediate and substantive response to
                unacceptable behaviors. </t>

        <section title="Concerns">

            <section title="Diversity">
                <t>Diversity concerns the variability of a group's composition.
                    It can reasonably touch every conceivable participant
                    attribute. It includes task-related attributes, such as
                    knowledge and experience, as well as the usual range of
                    "identified class" attributes, including race, creed, color,
                    religion, gender and sexual orientation, but also extends
                    to all manner of beliefs, behaviors, experiences,
                    preferences, and economic status.</t>

                <t>The factors affecting the quality of group decision-making
                    are complex and subtle, and are not subject to precise
                    specification. Nevertheless, in broad terms, groups with
                    greater diversity make better decisions <xref
                        target="Kellogg"/>. They perform better at diverse tasks
                    both in terms of quantity and quality, and a great deal of
                    research has found that heterogeneity often acts as a
                    conduit for ideas and innovation <xref target="WiseCrowd"
                        /> <xref target="Horowitz"/> <xref target="Stahl"
                        /> <xref target="Joshi"/>. The implicit assumptions of
                    one participant might not be considerations for another and
                    might even be unknown by still others. And, different
                    participants can bring different bases of knowledge and
                    different styles of analysis. People with the same
                    background and experience will all too readily bring the
                    same ideas forward and subject them to the same analysis,
                    thus diminishing the likelihood for new ideas and methods to
                    emerge, or underlying problems to be noted.</t>

                <t>However, a desire to diligently attend to group diversity
                    often leads to mechanical, statistical efforts to ensure
                    representation by every identified constituency. For smaller
                    populations, like the IETF and especially for its small
                    management teams, this approach is counterproductive.
                    First, it is not possible to identify every single
                    constituency that might be relevant. Second, the group size
                    does not permit representation by every group. Consequently,
                    in practical terms, legitimate representation of diversity
                    only requires meaningful variety, not slavish bookkeeping.
                    In addition, without care, it can lead to the negative
                    effects of diversity where decision-making is slowed,
                    interaction decreased, and conflict increased <xref
                        target="Horowitz"/>.</t>

                <t>Pragmatically, then, concern for diversity merely requires
                    serious attention to satisfying two requirements:<list>

                    </list> It also requires education about the practicalities
                    of diversity in an open engineering environment, and it
                    requires organizational processes that regularly consider
                    what effect each decision might have on diversity.</t>

                <t>Examples abound:<list style="symbols">

                        <t>Formally, an IETF working group makes its decisions
                            on its mailing list. Since anyone can join the list,
                            anyone with access to the Internet can participate.
                            However, working groups also have sessions at the
                            thrice-annual IETF face-to-face meetings and might
                            also hold interim meetings, which are face to face,
                            by telephone, or by video conference. Attendance at
                            these can be challenging. Getting to a face-to-face
                            meeting costs a great deal of money and time; remote
                            participation often incurs time-shifting that
                            includes very early or very late hours. So, increased
                            working group reliance on meetings tends to exclude
                            those with less funding or less travel time or more
                            structured work schedules.</t>

                        <t>Vigorous advocacy for a strongly held technical
                            preference is common in engineering communities. Of
                            course it can be healthy, since strong support is
                            necessary to promote success of the work. However, in
                            the IETF this can be manifest in two ways that are
                            problematic. One is a personal style that is overly
                            aggressive and serves to intimidate, and hence
                            unreasonably gag, those with other views. The other
                            is a group style that prematurely embraces a choice
                            and does not permit a fair hearing for alternatives. </t>

                        <t>Predictably, engineers value engineering skills. When
                            the task is engineering, this is entirely
                            appropriate. However, many of the IETF's activities,
                            in support of its engineering efforts, are less about
                            engineering and more about human and organizational
                            processes. These require very different skills. To
                            the extent that participants in those processes are
                            primarily considered in terms of their engineering
                            prowess, those who are instead stronger in other,
                            relevant skills will be undervalued, and the
                            diversity of expertise that the IETF needs will be
                            lost.</t>

                        <t>IETF standards are meant to be read, understood, and
                            implemented by people who were not part of the
                            working group process. The gist of the standards
                            also often needs to be read by managers and
                            operators who are not engineers. IETF specifications
                            enjoy quite a bit of stylistic freedom to contain
                            pedagogy, in the service of these audience goals.
                            However, the additional effort to be instructional is
                            significant, and active participants who already
                            understand and embrace the technical details often
                            decline from making that effort. Worse, that effort
                            is also needed during the specification development
                            effort, since many participants might lack the
                            background or superior insight needed to appreciate
                            what is being specified. Yet the IETF's mantra for
                            "rough consensus" is exactly about the need to
                            recruit support. In fact, the process of "educating"
                            others often uncovers issues that have been
                            missed.</t>

                <t>Many different behaviors can serve to reduce participant
                    diversity or participation diversity. One class of efforts
                    is based on overt actions to marginalize certain
                    participants by intimidating them into silence or
                    departure. Intimidation efforts divide into two styles
                    warranting distinction. One is harassment, which pertains to
                    biased treatment of demographic classes. A number of
                    identified classes are usually protected by law, and
                    community understanding that such biased behavior cannot be
                    tolerated has progressively improved.</t>
                <t>Other intimidation efforts are tailored to targeted
                    individuals and are generally labeled bullying 
<xref target="Har-Bul"/> <xref target="Workplace"/> <xref target="Signs"/>
<xref target="Escalated"/> <xref target="Prevention"/>. The nature and extent of bullying
                    in the workplace is widely underestimated, misunderstood, and
                    mishandled.

                        <t>The harassment also serves to intimidate others who
                            observe that it is tolerated. It teaches them that
                            misbehaviors will not be held accountable.</t>
                    </list></t>

                <t>The IETF's Anti-Harassment Policy <xref target="Anti-Harass"
                    /> uses a single term to cover the classic harassment of
                    identified constituencies, as well as the targeted behavior
                    of bullying. The policy's text is therefore comprehensive,
                    defining unacceptable behavior as "unwelcome hostile or
                    intimidating behavior." Further, it declares: "Harassment of
                    this sort will not be tolerated in the IETF." An avenue for
                    seeking remedy when harassment occurs is specified as a
                    designated Ombudsperson. </t>

                <t>Unified handling of bullying and harassment is exemplified in

                    including those with widely varying membership, even to the

                    </list> In fact, there is a view that harassment is merely a
                    form of bullying, given the same goal of undermining

                </t>

                <t>The IETF has a long history of tolerating aggressive and even
                    hostile behavior by participants. So, this policy signals a
                    formal and welcome change. The obvious challenge is to make
                    the change real, moving the IETF from a culture that
                    tolerates -- or even encourages -- interpersonal
                    misbehaviors to one that provides a safe, professional, and
                    productive haven for its increasingly diverse community. </t>


                <t>Here again, examples abound, to the present:<list
                        style="symbols">

                        <t>Amongst long-time colleagues, acceptable
                            interpersonal style can be whatever the colleagues
                            want, even though it might look quite off-putting to
                            an observer. The problem occurs when an IETF
                            participant engages in such behaviors with, or in
                            the presence of, others who have not agreed to the
                            social contract of that relationship style and might
                            not even understand it. For these others, the
                            behavior can be extremely alienating, creating a
                            disincentive against participation. Yet, in the IETF,
                            it is common for participants to feel entitled to
                            behave in overly familiar or aggressive or even
                            hostile fashion that might be acceptable amongst
                            colleagues, but is destructive with strangers.</t>

                        <t>The instant a comment is made that concerns any
                            attribute of a speaker, such as their motives, the
                            nature of their employer, or the quality of their
                            participation style, the interaction has moved away
                            from technical evaluation. In many cultures, all
                            such utterances are intimidating or offensive. In an
                            open, professional participation environment, they
                            therefore cannot be permitted. </t>

                            group. Whether nonverbal (such as rolling one's

                            naivete), or overtly hostile (such as impugning the
                            target's motives), it is an attempt to marginalize
                            the person rather than focus on the merits of what
                            they are saying. It constitutes harassment or

                <t>After materials and discussions are located, the primary
                    means of making it easy to access the substance of the work
                    is for statements to be made in language that is clear and
                    explanatory. Writers and speakers need to carefully consider
                    the likely audience and package statements accordingly. This
                    often means taking a more tutorial approach than one might
                    naturally choose. In speech, it means speaking more
                    deliberately, a bit more clearly and a bit more slowly than
                    needed with close collaborators. When language is cryptic or
                    filled with linguistic idiosyncrasies and when speech is too
                    fast, it is dramatically less accessible to a diverse

                <t>Within the IETF, the most common challenge is choosing how to
                    respond to comments. The essence of the IETF is making
                    proposals and offering comments on proposals; disagreement
                    is common and often healthy, depending upon the manner in

                <t>There is the larger challenge of finding balance between
                    efforts to facilitate diversity versus efforts to achieve
                    work goals. Efforts to be inclusive include a degree of
                    tutorial assistance for new participants. They also include
                    some tolerance for participants who are less efficient at
                    doing the work. Further, not everyone is capable of being
                    constructive, and the burdens of accommodating such folk can
                    easily become onerous.</t>

                    be a succession of presentations. For good efficiency,
                    participants want to have just enough presentation to frame
                    a question, and then spend face-to-face time in discussion.
                    However, "just enough presentation" does not leave much room
                    for tutorial commentary to aid those new to the effort.
                    Meeting time is always too short, and the primary
                    requirement is to achieve forward progress.</t>

            <section title="IETF Track Record">
                <t>The IETF's track record for making its technical documents
                    openly available is notably superb, as is its official
                    policy of open participation in mailing lists and meetings.
                    Its track record with management and process documentation
                    is more varied, partly because these cover overhead
                    functions, rather than being in the main line of IETF work
                    and, therefore, expertise. So, they do not always get
                    diligent attention. Factors include the inherent challenges
                    in doing management by engineers, as well as challenges in
                    making management and process documents usable for
                    non-experts and non-native English speakers.</t>

                <t>On the surface, the IETF's track record for open access and
                    engagement therefore looks astonishingly good, since there
                    is no "membership", and anyone is permitted to join IETF
                    mailing lists and attend IETF meetings. Indeed, for those
                    with good funding, time for travel, and skills at figuring
                    out the IETF culture, the record really does qualify as
                    excellent.</t>

                <t>However, very real challenges exist for those who have
                    funding, logistics, or language limitations. In particular,
                    these impede attendance at meetings. Another challenge is
                    for those from more polite cultures who are alienated by the
                    style of aggressive debate that is popular in the IETF. </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Avoiding Distraction">
                <t>For any one participant, some other participant's
                    contributions might be considered problematic, possibly
                    having little or no value. Worse, some contributions are in
                    a style that excites a personal, negative reaction.</t>

                <t>The manner chosen for responding to such contributions
                    dramatically affects group productivity. Attacking the
                    speaker's style or motives or credentials is not useful, and
                    primarily serves to distract discussion from matters of
                    substance. In the face of such challenges and among the many
                    possible ways to pursue constructive exchange, guidance
                    includes: <list style="symbols">

                        <t>Ignore such contributions; perhaps someone else can
                            produce a productive exchange, but there is no
                            requirement that anyone respond.</t>
                        <t>Respond to the content, not the author; in the
                            extreme, literally ignore the author and merely
                            address the group about the content. </t>
                        <t>Offer better content, including an explanation of the
                            reasons it is better.</t>
                    </list> The essential point here is that the way to have a
                    constructive exchange about substance is to focus on the
                    substance. The way to avoid getting distracted is to ignore
                    whatever is personal and irrelevant to the substance.</t>

            </section>

        </section>


        <section title="Responses to Unconstructive Participation">

            <t>Sometimes problematic participants cannot reasonably be ignored.
                Their behavior is too disruptive, too offensive, or too damaging
                to group exchange. Any of us might have a moment of excess, but
                when the behavior is too extreme or represents a pattern, it
                warrants intervention.</t>

            <t>A common view is that this should be pursued personally, but for
                such cases, it rarely has much effect. This is where IETF
                management intervention is required. The IETF now has a
                reasonably rich set of policies concerning problematic behavior.
                So, the requirement is merely to exercise the policies
                diligently. Depending on the details, the working group chair,
                mailing list moderator, Ombudsperson, or perhaps IETF Chair is the
                appropriate person to contact <xref target="MlLists"/> <xref
                    target="Anti-Harass"/>.</t>

            <t>The challenge, here, is for both management and the rest of the
                community to collaborate in communicating that harassment and
                bullying will not be tolerated. The formal policies make that
                declaration, but they have no meaning unless they are
                enforced.</t>

            <t>Abusive behavior is easily extinguished. All it takes is
                community resolve. </t>
        </section>


        <section title="Security Considerations">
            <t>The security of the IETF's role in the Internet community depends
                upon its credibility as an open and productive venue for
                collaborative development of technical documents. 


   More diverse scrutiny leads to increased rigor, so the 
   quality of technical documents will potentially improve. 

                The potential for future legal liability in the various
                jurisdictions within which the IETF operates also indicates a
                need to act to reinforce behavioral policies with specific
                attention to workplace safety.</t>

            <t>This document was prompted by the organizational change, signaled
                with the IESG's adoption of an anti-harassment policy for the
                IETF, and a number of follow-on activities and discussions that
                ensued. A few individuals have offered thoughtful comments
                during private discussions.</t>
