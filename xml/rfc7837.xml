<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>Congestion Exposure (ConEx) <xref target="RFC7713"/> is a mechanism by which senders inform the network about the congestion encountered by packets earlier in the same flow. This document specifies an IPv6 destination option <xref target="RFC2460"/> that can be used for performing ConEx markings in IPv6 datagrams.</t>

<t>This document specifies the ConEx wire protocol in IPv6. The ConEx
information can be used by any network element on the path to, for example, do
traffic management or egress policing. Additionally, this information will
potentially be used by an audit function that checks the integrity of the
sender's signaling. Further, each transport protocol that supports ConEx
signaling will need to precisely specify when the transport sets ConEx
markings (e.g., the behavior for TCP is specified in <xref target="RFC7786"/>).</t>

<t>This document specifies ConEx for IPv6 only. Due to space limitations in
the IPv4 header and the risk of options that might be stripped by a middlebox in IPv4, the primary goal of the working group was to specify ConEx in IPv6 for experimentation.</t>

<t>This specification is experimental to allow the IETF to assess whether the decision to implement the ConEx Signal as a destination option fulfills the requirements stated in this document, as well as to evaluate the proposed encoding of the ConEx Signals as described in <xref target="RFC7713"/>.</t>

<t>The duration of this experiment is expected to be no less than two years from publication 
of this document as infrastructure is needed to be set up to determine the outcome 
of this experiment. Experimenting with ConEx requires IPv6 traffic. Even
though the amount of IPv6 traffic is growing, the traffic mix carried over
IPv6 is still very different than over IPv4. Therefore, it might take longer to
find a suitable test scenario where only IPv6 traffic is managed using ConEx.
</t>

<section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target='RFC2119' />.</t>
</section>

<section title="Requirements for the Coding of ConEx in IPv6">

<t>A set of requirements for an ideal concrete ConEx wire protocol is given in <xref target="RFC7713"/>. The ConEx working group recognized that it will be difficult to find an encoding in IPv6 that satisfies all requirements.

The choice in this document to implement the ConEx information in a destination option aims to satisfy those requirements that constrain the placement of ConEx information:

<list style="format R-%d:">
	<t>The marking mechanism needs to be visible to all ConEx-capable
	nodes on the path.</t>
	<t>The mechanism needs to be able to traverse nodes that do not
	understand the markings. This is required to ensure that ConEx can
	be incrementally deployed over the Internet.</t>
	<t>The presence of the marking mechanism should not significantly
	alter the processing of the packet. This is required to ensure that
	ConEx-Marked packets do not face any undue delays or drops due to a
	badly chosen mechanism.</t>
	<t>The markings should be immutable once set by the sender. At the
	very least, any tampering should be detectable.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t> Based on these requirements, four solutions to implement the ConEx 
	information in the IPv6 header have been investigated: hop-by-hop options, 
	destination options, using IPv6 header bits (from the flow label), and new 
	extension headers. After evaluating the different solutions, the ConEx working group concluded 
	that the use of a destination option would best address these requirements.</t>

<t>
Hop-by-hop options would have been the best solution for carrying ConEx
markings if they had met requirement R-3. There is currently some work
ongoing in the 6MAN working group to address this very issue <xref target="HBH-HEADER"/>. This new behavior would address R-3 and would make hop-by-hop options the preferred solution for carrying ConEx markings.
</t>

<t>Choosing to use a destination option does not necessarily satisfy the requirement for on-path visibility,
     because it can be encapsulated by additional IP header(s). Therefore, ConEx-aware network devices,
     including policy or audit devices, might have to follow the chaining
     (extension-) headers into inner IP
     headers to find ConEx information.
     This choice was a compromise between fast-path performance of ConEx-aware network nodes and visibility, as discussed in <xref target="fastpath"/>.</t>
<t>Please note that the IPv6 specification <xref target="RFC2460"/> does not
require or expect intermediate nodes to inspect destination options such as
the ConEx Destination Option (CDO). This implies that ConEx-aware intermediate nodes following this specification need updated extension header processing code to be able read the destination options.
</t>
</section>

<section title="ConEx Destination Option (CDO)" anchor="cdo">
	<t>The CDO is a destination option that can be 
	included in IPv6 datagrams that are sent by ConEx-aware senders in order to 
	inform ConEx-aware nodes on the path about the congestion encountered by 
	packets earlier in the same flow or the expected risk of encountering congestion
	in the future. The CDO does not have any alignment requirements.

<vspace/>
<vspace/>
These four bits are not used in the current specification.
They are set to zero by the sender and are ignored by the
receiver.
</t> 
</list>
</t>
<t> All packets sent over a ConEx-capable TCP connection or belonging
to the same ConEx-capable flow MUST carry the CDO. The chg bit (the
third-highest-order bit) in the CDO Option Type field is set to zero,
meaning that the CDO option is immutable. Network devices with
ConEx-aware functions read the flags, but all network devices MUST
forward the CDO unaltered.
</t>
<t>The CDO SHOULD be placed as the first option in the Destination Option header 
	before the AH <xref target="RFC4302" /> and/or Encapsulating Security
	Payload (ESP) <xref target="RFC4303" /> (if
	present). The IPsec Authentication Header (AH) MAY 
	be used to verify that the CDO has not been modified.
</t>
<t>If the X bit is zero, all the other three bits are undefined and thus MUST be ignored 
	and forwarded unchanged by network nodes.
	The X bit set to zero means that the connection is ConEx-capable but
	that this packet MUST NOT be counted when determining ConEx
	information in an audit function. This can be the case if no
	congestion feedback is (currently) available, e.g., in TCP 
	if one endpoint has been receiving data but sending nothing but pure ACKs 
	(no user data) for some time. This is because pure ACKs do not advance 
	the sequence number, so the TCP endpoint receiving them cannot reliably tell 
	whether any have been lost due to congestion. 
	Pure TCP ACKs cannot be ECN-marked either <xref target="RFC3168"/>.
</t>

<t> If the X bit is set, any of the other three bits (L, E, or C) might be set.
	Whenever one of these bits is set, the 
	number of bytes carried by this IP packet (including the IP header
	that directly encapsulates the CDO and everything that IP header
	encapsulates) SHOULD be counted to determine
	congestion or credit information. In IPv6, the number of bytes can easily
	be calculated by adding the number 40 (length of the IPv6 header in
	bytes) to the value present in the Payload Length field in the IPv6 header. 
</t>
<t> 
    The credit signal represents potential for congestion.
    If a congestion event occurs, a corresponding amount of credit is consumed as outlined
    in <xref target="RFC7713"/>.
    A ConEx-enabled sender SHOULD, therefore, signal sufficient credit in advance of any
    congestion event to cover the (estimated maximum) amount of lost or
    CE-marked bytes that could occur in such a congestion event. This estimation depends on
    the heuristics used and aggressiveness of the sender when deciding the
    appropriate sending rate (congestion control). Note that the maximum
    congestion risk is that all packets in flight get lost or CE-marked; therefore, this would be the most
    conservative estimation for the congestion risk.  After a congestion event, if the sender intends to take the same
    risk again, it just needs to replace the consumed credit as non-consumed
    credit does not expire. For the case of TCP, this is described in detail in
    <xref target="RFC7786"/>.
</t>

<t>
If the L or E bit is set, a congestion signal in the form of a loss or an ECN
mark, respectively, was previously experienced by the same connection.
 
</t>
<t> In principle, all of these three bits (L, E, or C) might be set in the same
packet. In this case, the packet size MUST be counted once for each respective
ConEx information counter. 
</t>
<t> If a network node extracts the ConEx information from a connection, it is expected to 
	hold this information in bytes, e.g., comparing the total number of bytes
	sent with the number of bytes sent with	ConEx congestion marks (L or E) to determine the
	current whole path congestion level. 
	Therefore, a ConEx-aware node that processes the CDO MUST use the Payload Length
    field of the preceding IPv6 header for byte-based counting.
	When a ratio is measured and equally sized packets can be assumed, counting the number
    of packets (instead of the number of bytes) should deliver the same result.
	But an audit function must be aware that this estimation can be
	quite wrong if, for example, different sized packed are sent; thus, it is not reliable.
</t>
<t>All remaining bits in the CDO are reserved for future use (which are currently the last four bits of the eight bit option space). A ConEx sender SHOULD set the reserved bits in the CDO to zero.
	Other nodes MUST ignore these bits and ConEx-aware intermediate nodes
	MUST forward them unchanged, whatever their values. They MAY log the
	presence of a non-zero Reserved field.	
</t>

<t>The CDO is only applicable on unicast or anycast packets 
(for reasoning, see the note regarding item J on multicast at the end of
Section 3.3 of <xref target="RFC7713"/>).

A ConEx sender MUST NOT send a packet with the CDO to a multicast address.
ConEx-capable network nodes MUST treat a multicast packet with the X flag set 
the same as an equivalent packet without the CDO, and they SHOULD forward it unchanged.
</t>

<t>As stated in <xref target="RFC7713"/> (see Section 3.3, item N on network-layer requirements), protocol specs should describe any warning or error messages relevant to the encoding. 
There are no warnings or error messages associated with the CDO. 
</t>
</section>

<section title="Implementation in the Fast Path of ConEx-Aware Routers" anchor="fastpath">
<t>The ConEx information is being encoded into a destination option so
	that it does not impact forwarding performance in the non-ConEx-aware
	nodes on the path.  Since destination options are not usually
	processed by routers, the existence of the CDO does not affect the
	fast-path processing of the datagram on non-ConEx-aware routers, i.e.,
	they are not pushed into the slow path towards the control plane for
	exception processing. </t>
	
<t>ConEx-aware nodes still need to process the CDO without severely
	affecting forwarding.  For this to be possible, the ConEx-aware
	routers need to quickly ascertain the presence of the CDO and process
	the option if it is present. To efficiently perform this, the CDO
	needs to be placed in a fairly deterministic location.  In order to
	facilitate forwarding on ConEx-aware routers, ConEx-aware senders that
	send IPv6 datagrams with the CDO SHOULD place the CDO as the first
	destination option in the Destination Option header.</t>
</section>


<section title="Tunnel Processing">
<t>As with any destination option, an ingress tunnel endpoint will not normally copy the CDO 
	when adding an encapsulating outer IP header. In general, an ingress
	tunnel SHOULD NOT copy the CDO to the outer header as this would
	change the number of bytes that would  be counted. However, it MAY
	copy the CDO to the outer header in order to facilitate visibility by
	subsequent on-path ConEx functions if the configuration of the tunnel
	ingress and the ConEx nodes is coordinated.
	This trades off the performance of ConEx functions against that of tunnel processing. 
</t>
<t>An egress tunnel endpoint SHOULD ignore any CDO in the outer header on decapsulation of an 
	outer IP header. The information in any inner CDO will always be
	considered correct, even if it differs from any outer CDO. Therefore, 
	the decapsulator can strip the outer CDO without comparison to the inner. 
	A decapsulator MAY compare the two and MAY log any case where they differ.
	However, the packet MUST be forwarded irrespective of any such anomaly,
	given an outer CDO is only a performance optimization. 
</t>

<t>A network node that assesses ConEx information SHOULD search for 
	encapsulated IP headers until a CDO is found. At any specific network 
	location, the maximum necessary depth of search is likely to be the same 
	for all packets between a given set of tunnel endpoints.</t>

</section>

<section title="Compatibility with Use of IPsec" anchor="compat">

<t>A network-based attacker could alter ConEx information to fool an audit function in a
downstream network into discarding packets. If the endpoints are using the IPsec
Authentication Header (AH) <xref target="RFC2460"/> to detect alteration of IP headers
along the path, AH will also detect alteration of the CDO header. Nonetheless, AH protection
will rarely need to be introduced for ConEx, because attacks by one network on another are
rare if they are traceable. Other known attacks from one network on another, such as TTL expiry
attacks, are more damaging to the innocent network (because the ConEx audit discards silently) and
less traceable (because TTL is meant to change, whereas CDO is not).</t>

<t><xref target="cdo"/> specifies that the CDO is placed in the Destination Option header
    before the AH and/or ESP headers so that ConEx information remains
    in the clear if ESP is being used to encrypt other transmitted information
    in transport mode <xref target="RFC4301"/>.
    In general, a Destination Option header inside an IPv6 packet can be placed in
    two possible positions, either before the Routing header or after the
    ESP/AH headers as described in Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC2460"/>. If
    the CDO was placed in the latter position and an ESP header was used
    with encryption, ConEx-aware intermediate nodes would not
    be able to view and interpret the CDO, effectively rendering it useless.</t>

<t>The IPv6 protocol architecture currently does not provide a mechanism 
	for new headers to be copied to the outer IP header. Therefore, if IPsec encryption 
	is used in tunnel mode, ConEx information cannot be accessed over the extent of the ESP tunnel.
</t>

<t>The destination IP stack will not usually process the CDO;
therefore, the sender can send a CDO without checking if the receiver
will understand it. The CDO MUST still be forwarded to the destination
IP stack, because the destination might check the integrity of the
whole packet, irrespective of whether it understands ConEx.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Mitigating Flooding Attacks by Using Preferential Drop ">
<t>The ideas in this section are aspirational, not being essential to the use
of ConEx for
	more general traffic management. However, once CDO information is
	present, the CDO header could optionally also be used in the data plane
	of any IP-aware forwarding node to mitigate flooding attacks. 
</t>

<t>Please note that ConEx is an experimental protocol and that any kind of
mechanism that reacts to information provided by the ConEx protocol
needs to be evaluated in experimentation as well.
This is also true, or especially true, for the preferential drop mechanism described below.</t>
	
<t>Dropping packets preferentially that are not ConEx-capable or do not carry a ConEx mark
    can be beneficial to mitigate flooding attacks as ConEx-Marked packets can be assumed to be
    already restricted by a ConEx ingress policer as further described in
    <xref target="RFC7713"/>. Therefore, the following ConEx-based preferential dropping scheme is proposed:</t>

<t>If a router queue experiences a very high load so that it has
	to drop arriving packets, it MAY preferentially drop packets within the same
	DiffServ Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) using the preference order given in <xref target="Tab1"/> (1 means drop first).
	Additionally, if a router implements preferential drop based on
	ConEx, it SHOULD also support ECN marking.
	Even though preferential dropping can be difficult to implement on some hardware,
    if nowhere else, routers at the egress of
	a network SHOULD implement preferential drop based on ConEx markings (stronger than the MAY above).
</t>
	
<texttable anchor="Tab1" align="center" title="Drop Preference for ConEx Packets">
	<ttcol align="left"></ttcol> <ttcol align="center">Preference</ttcol>
	<c>Not-ConEx or no CDO</c> <c>1 (drop first)</c>
	<c>X (but not L,E or C)</c> <c>2</c>
	<c>X and L,E or C</c> <c>3</c>
</texttable>	
	
<t> A flooding attack is inherently about congestion of a resource.
	As load focuses on a victim, upstream queues
	grow, requiring honest sources to pre-load packets with a higher
	fraction of ConEx marks.  
</t>
<t>If ECN marking is supported by downstream queues, preferential dropping
	provides the most benefits because, if the queue is so congested 
	that it drops traffic, it will be CE-marking 100% of any forwarded traffic.  
	Honest sources will therefore be sending 100% ConEx E-marked packets 
	(and subject to rate-limiting at an ingress policer).</t>

<t>Senders under malicious control can either do the same as honest
	sources and be rate-limited at ingress, or they can understate
	congestion and not set the E bit.</t>
    
<t>If the preferential drop ranking is implemented on
	queues, these queues will reserve E/L-marked
	traffic until last.  So, the traffic from malicious sources
	will all be automatically dropped first.  Either way, malicious
	sources cannot send more than honest sources.
    Therefore, ConEx-based preferential dropping as described above
    discriminates against attack traffic
    if done as part of the overall policing framework as described in
    <xref target="RFC7713"/>.
</t>
</section>


<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
<t><xref target="RFC7713"/> describes the overall audit framework for assuring 
that ConEx markings truly reflect actual path congestion and <xref
target="CONEX-AUDIT" /> provides further details on the handling of audit
signals. This section focuses purely on the security of the encoding chosen
for ConEx markings. 
</t>

<t>The CDO Option Type is defined with a chg bit set to zero as
described in <xref target="cdo"/>. If IPsec AH is used, a zero chg bit causes AH
to cover the CDO option so that its end-to-end integrity can be
verified, as explained in <xref target="cdo"/>.</t>

<t>This document specifies that the Reserved field in the CDO must be 
ignored and forwarded unchanged even if it does not contain all 
zeroes. The Reserved field is also required to sit outside the 
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), at least in transport mode (see
<xref target="compat"/>). This allows the sender to use the Reserved field 
as a 4-bit-per-packet covert channel to send information to an
on-path node outside the control of IPsec. However, a covert channel 
is only a concern if it can circumvent IPsec in tunnel mode and, in 
the tunnel mode case, ESP would close the covert channel as outlined 
in <xref target="compat"/>. </t>

</section>


<section title="IANA Considerations">
<t>
   The IPv6 ConEx destination option is used for carrying ConEx
   markings.  This document uses the experimental option type 0x1E
   (as assigned in IANA's "Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop Options" registry) with the
   act bits set to 00 and the chg bit set to 0 for realizing
   this option. No further allocation action is required from IANA at
   this time.
