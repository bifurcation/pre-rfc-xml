    <abstract>
      <t>Some applications require the ability to provide an elevated
      probability of session establishment to specific sessions in times of
      network congestion. When supported over the Internet Protocol suite,
      this may be facilitated through a network-layer admission control
      solution that supports prioritized access to resources (e.g.,
      bandwidth). These resources may be explicitly set aside for prioritized
      sessions, or may be shared with other sessions. This document specifies
      extensions to the Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP) that can be used
      to support such an admission priority capability at the network
      layer.</t>

      <t>Based on current security concerns, these extensions are intended for
      use in a single administrative domain.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Some applications require the ability to provide an elevated
      probability of session establishment to specific sessions in times of
      network congestion.</t>

      <t>Solutions to meet this requirement for elevated session establishment
      probability may involve session-layer capabilities prioritizing access
      to resources controlled by the session control function. As an example,
      entities involved in session control (such as SIP user agents, when the
      Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261"></xref>, is the
      session control protocol in use) can influence their treatment of
      session establishment requests (such as SIP requests). This may include
      the ability to "queue" session establishment requests when those can not
      be immediately honored (in some cases with the notion of "bumping", or
      "displacement", of less important session establishment requests from
      that queue). It may include additional mechanisms such as
      alternate routing and exemption from
      certain network management controls.</t>

      <t>Solutions to meet the requirement for elevated session establishment
      probability may also take advantage of network-layer admission control
      mechanisms supporting admission priority. Networks usually have
      engineered capacity limits that characterize the maximum load that can
      be handled (say, on any given link) for a class of traffic while
      satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of that traffic class.
      Admission priority may involve setting aside some network resources
      (e.g., bandwidth) out of the engineered capacity limits for the
      prioritized sessions only. Or alternatively, it may involve allowing the
      prioritized sessions to seize additional resources beyond the engineered
      capacity limits applied to normal sessions. This document specifies the
      necessary extensions to support such admission priority when network-layer admission control is performed using the Resource reSerVation
      Protocol (RSVP) <xref target="RFC2205"></xref>.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC3181"></xref> specifies the Signaled Preemption
      Priority Policy Element that can be signaled in RSVP so that network
      node may take into account this policy element in order to preempt some
      previously admitted low-priority sessions in order to make room for a
      newer, higher-priority session. In contrast, this document specifies new
      RSVP extensions to increase the probability of session establishment
      without preemption of existing sessions. This is achieved by engineered
      capacity techniques in the form of bandwidth allocation models. In
      particular, this document specifies two new RSVP policy elements allowing
      the admission priority to be conveyed inside RSVP signaling messages so
      that RSVP nodes can enforce a selective bandwidth admission control
      decision based on the session admission priority. Appendix A of this
      document also provides examples of bandwidth allocation models that can
      be used by RSVP-routers to enforce such admission priority on every
      link. A given reservation may be signaled with the admission priority
      extensions specified in the present document, with the preemption
      priority specified in <xref target="RFC3181"></xref>, or with both.</t>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>This document assumes the terminology defined in <xref
        target="RFC2753"></xref>. For convenience, the definitions of a few key
        terms are repeated here:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Policy Decision Point (PDP): The point where policy decisions
            are made.</t>

            <t>Local Policy Decision Point (LPDP): The PDP local to the network
            element.</t>

            <t>Policy Enforcement Point (PEP): The point where the policy
            decisions are actually enforced.</t>

            <t>Policy Ignorant Node (PIN): A network element that does not
            explicitly support policy control using the mechanisms defined in
            <xref target="RFC2753"></xref>.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="overview"
             title="Overview of RSVP Extensions and Operations">
      <t>Let us consider the case where a session requires elevated
      probability of establishment, and more specifically that the preference
      to be granted to this session is in terms of network-layer "admission
      priority" (as opposed to preference granted through preemption of
      existing sessions). By "admission priority" we mean allowing the
      priority session to seize network-layer resources from the engineered
      capacity that has been set aside for priority sessions (and not made
      available to normal sessions) or, alternatively, allowing the priority
      session to seize additional resources beyond the engineered capacity
      limits applied to normal sessions.</t>

      <t>Session establishment can be made conditional on resource-based and
      policy-based network-layer admission control achieved via RSVP
      signaling. In the case where the session control protocol is SIP, the
      use of RSVP-based admission control in conjunction with SIP is specified
      in <xref target="RFC3312"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Devices involved in the session establishment are expected to be
      aware of the application-level priority requirements of prioritized
      sessions. For example, considering the case where the session control
      protocol is SIP, the SIP user agents may be made aware of the resource
      priority requirements of a given session using the "Resource-Priority"
      header mechanism specified in <xref target="RFC4412"></xref>. The
      end-devices involved in the upper-layer session establishment simply
      need to copy the application-level resource priority requirements (e.g.,
      as communicated in the SIP "Resource-Priority" header) inside the new RSVP
      Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element defined in this
      document.</t>

      <t>Conveying the application-level resource priority requirements inside
      the RSVP message allows this application-level requirement to be
      mapped/remapped into a different RSVP "admission priority" at a policy
      boundary based on the policy applicable in that policy area. In a
      typical model (see <xref target="RFC2753"></xref>) where PDPs control
      PEPs at the periphery of the policy area (e.g., on the first hop router),
      PDPs would interpret the RSVP Application-Level Resource Priority Policy
      Element and map the requirement of the prioritized session into an RSVP
      "admission priority" level. Then, PDPs would convey this information
      inside the new Admission Priority Policy Element defined in this
      document. This way, the RSVP admission priority can be communicated to
      downstream PEPs (i.e., RSVP routers) of the same policy domain that
      have LPDPs but no controlling PDP. In turn, this means the necessary
      RSVP Admission priority can be enforced at every RSVP hop, including all
      the (possibly many) hops that do not have any understanding of
      application-level resource priority semantics. It is not expected that
      the RSVP Application-Level Resource Priority Header Policy Element would
      be taken into account at RSVP hops within a given policy area. It is
      expected to be used at policy area boundaries only in order to set/reset
      the RSVP Admission Priority Policy Element.</t>

      <t>Remapping by PDPs of the Admission Priority Policy Element from the
      Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element may also be used at
      boundaries with other signaling protocols, such as the NSIS Signaling
      Layer Protocol (NSLP) for QoS Signaling <xref
      target="RFC5974"></xref>.</t>

      <t>As can be observed, the framework described above for
      mapping/remapping application-level resource priority requirements into
      an RSVP admission priority can also be used together with <xref
      target="RFC3181"></xref> for mapping/remapping application-level
      resource priority requirements into an RSVP preemption priority (when
      preemption is indeed deemed necessary by the prioritized session
      handling policy). In that case, when processing the RSVP
      Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element, the PDPs at policy
      boundaries (or between various QoS signaling protocols) can map it into
      an RSVP "preemption priority" information. This preemption priority
      information comprises a setup preemption level and a defending
      preemption priority level that can then be encoded inside the Preemption
      Priority Policy Element of <xref target="RFC3181"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Appendix B provides examples of various hypothetical policies for
      prioritized session handling, some of them involving admission priority,
      some of them involving both admission priority and preemption priority.
      Appendix B also identifies how the application-level resource priority
      needs to be mapped into RSVP policy elements by the PDPs to realize
      these policies.</t>

      <section title="Operations of Admission Priority">
        <t>The RSVP Admission Priority Policy Element defined in this document
        allows admission bandwidth to be allocated preferentially to
        prioritized sessions. Multiple models of bandwidth allocation MAY be
        used to that end.</t>

        <t>A number of bandwidth allocation models have been defined in the
        IETF for allocation of bandwidth across different classes of traffic
        trunks in the context of Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering.
        Those include the Maximum Allocation Model (MAM) defined in <xref
        target="RFC4125"></xref>, the Russian Dolls Model (RDM) specified in
        <xref target="RFC4127"></xref>, and the Maximum Allocation model with
        Reservation (MAR) defined
        in <xref target="RFC4126"></xref>. However, these
        same models MAY be applied for allocation of bandwidth across
        different levels of admission priority as defined in this document.
        Appendix A provides an illustration of how these bandwidth allocation
        models can be applied for such purposes and also introduces an
        additional bandwidth allocation model that we term the Priority Bypass
        Model (PrBM). It is important to note that the models described and
        illustrated in Appendix A are only informative and do not represent a
        recommended course of action.</t>

        <t>We can see in these examples how the RSVP Admission Priority can be
        used by RSVP routers to influence their admission control decision
        (for example, by determining which bandwidth pool is to be used by RSVP
        for performing its bandwidth allocation) and therefore to increase the
        probability of reservation establishment. In turn, this increases the
        probability of application-level session establishment for the
        corresponding session.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="New Policy Elements">
      <t>The Framework document for policy-based admission control <xref
      target="RFC2753"></xref> describes the various components that
      participate in policy decision making (i.e., PDP, PEP, and LPDP).</t>

      <t>As described in <xref target="overview"></xref> of the present
      document, the Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element and the
      Admission Priority Policy Element serve different roles in this
      framework: <list style="symbols">
          <t>The Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element conveys
          application-level information and is processed by PDPs.</t>

          <t>The emphasis of Admission Priority Policy Element is to be
          simple, stateless, and lightweight such that it can be processed
          internally within a node's LPDP. It can then be enforced internally
          within a node's PEP. It is set by PDPs based on processing of the
          Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element.</t>
        </list><xref target="RFC2750"></xref> defines extensions for
      supporting generic policy-based admission control in RSVP. These
      extensions include the standard format of POLICY_DATA objects and a
      description of RSVP handling of policy events.</t>

      <t>The POLICY_DATA object contains one or more policy elements, each
      representing a different (and perhaps orthogonal) policy. As an example,
      <xref target="RFC3181"></xref> specifies the Preemption Priority Policy
      Element. This document defines two new policy elements called:</t>

        <section title="Admission Priority Merging Rules">
          <t>This section discusses alternatives for dealing with RSVP
          admission priority in case of merging of reservations. As merging
          applies to multicast, this section also applies to multicast
          sessions.</t>

          <t>The rules for merging Admission Priority Policy Elements are

          accordance with the corresponding IANA registry. This registry
          applies both to the Merge Strategy field of the Admission Priority
          Policy Element defined in the present document and to the Merge
          Strategy field of the Preemption Priority Policy Element
 defined in
          <xref target="RFC3181"></xref>. The registry initially contains the
          values already defined in <xref target="RFC3181"></xref>
          (see the "IANA
          Considerations" section).</t>

          <t>The only difference from <xref target="RFC3181"></xref> is that
          this document does not recommend a given merge strategy over the
          others for Admission Priority, while <xref target="RFC3181"></xref>
          recommends the first of these merge strategies for Preemption
          Priority. Note that with the Admission Priority (as is the case with
          the Preemption Priority), "take highest priority" translates into
          "take the highest numerical value".</t>

          <t>In case of multicast, when POLICY_DATA objects are not protected

          Priority Elements to reduce their size and number. When they do

              once. In other words, the outgoing ALRP List is the union of the
              incoming ALRP Lists that are merged.</t>

      <section title="Default Handling">
        <t>As specified in Section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC2750"></xref>,
        Policy Ignorant Nodes (PINs) implement a default handling of
        POLICY_DATA objects ensuring that those objects can traverse PINs
        in transit from one PEP to another. This applies to the situations
        where POLICY_DATA objects contain the Admission Priority Policy
        Element and the ALRP Policy Element specified in this document, so
        that those objects can traverse PINs.</t>

        <t>Section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC2750"></xref> also defines a
        similar default behavior for policy-capable nodes that do not
        recognize a particular policy element. This applies to the Admission
        Priority Policy Element and the ALRP Policy Element specified in this
        document, so that those elements can traverse policy-capable nodes that do not
        support these extensions defined in the present document.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>As this document defines extensions to RSVP, the security
      considerations of RSVP apply. Those are discussed in <xref
      target="RFC2205"></xref>, <xref target="RFC4230"></xref>, and <xref
      target="GROUPKEYING"></xref>. Approaches
      for addressing those concerns are discussed further below.</t>

      <t>A subset of RSVP messages are signaled with the Router Alert Option
      (RAO) (<xref target="RFC2113"></xref>, <xref target="RFC2711"></xref>). The security aspects and common
      practices around the use of the current IP Router Alert Option and
      consequences on the use of IP Router Alert by applications such as RSVP
      are discussed in <xref
      target="RFC6398"></xref>. As
      discussed in <xref target="applicability"></xref>, the extensions
      defined in this document are intended for use within a single
      administrative domain.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC6398"></xref>
      discusses router alert protection approaches for service providers.
      These approaches can be used to protect a given network against the
      potential risks associated with the leaking of router alert packets
      resulting from the use of the present extensions in another domain.
      Also, where RSVP is not used, by simply not enabling RSVP on the routers
      of a given network, generally that network can isolate itself from any
      RSVP signaling that may leak from another network that uses the present
      extensions (since the routers will then typically ignore RSVP messages).
      Where RSVP is to be used internally within a given network, the network
      operator can activate, on the edge of his network, mechanisms that
      either tunnel or, as a last resort, drop incoming RSVP messages in order to protect the
      given network from RSVP signaling that may leak from another network
      that uses the present extensions.</t>

      <t>The ADMISSION_PRI and APP_RESOURCE_PRI Policy Elements defined in
      this document are signaled by RSVP through encapsulation in a POLICY_DATA object as defined in <xref target="RFC2750"></xref>. Therefore,
      like any other policy elements, their integrity can be protected as
      discussed in Section 6 of <xref target="RFC2750"></xref> by two optional
      security mechanisms. The first mechanism relies on RSVP authentication
      as specified in <xref target="RFC2747"></xref> and <xref
      target="RFC3097"></xref> to provide a chain of trust when all RSVP nodes
      are policy capable. With this mechanism, the INTEGRITY object is carried
      inside RSVP messages. The second mechanism relies on the INTEGRITY
      object within the POLICY_DATA object to guarantee integrity between RSVP
      PEPs that are not RSVP neighbors.</t>

      <section title="Use of RSVP Authentication between RSVP Neighbors">
        <t>RSVP authentication can be used between RSVP neighbors that are
        policy capable. RSVP authentication (defined in <xref
        target="RFC2747"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3097"></xref>) SHOULD be
        supported by an implementation of the present document.</t>

        <t>With RSVP authentication, the RSVP neighbors use shared keys to
        compute the cryptographic signature of the RSVP message. <xref
        target="GROUPKEYING"></xref> discusses
        key types and key provisioning methods as well as their respective
        applicabilities.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Use of INTEGRITY object within the POLICY_DATA Object">
        <t>The INTEGRITY object within the POLICY_DATA object can be used to
        guarantee integrity between non-neighboring RSVP PEPs. This is useful
        only when some RSVP nodes are Policy Ignorant Nodes (PINs). The
        INTEGRITY object within the POLICY_DATA object MAY be supported by an
        implementation of the present document.</t>

        <t>Details for computation of the content of the INTEGRITY object can
        be found in Appendix B of <xref target="RFC2750"></xref>. This states
        that the Policy Decision Point (PDP), at its discretion, and based on
        the destination PEP/PDP or other criteria, selects an Authentication Key
        and the hash algorithm to be used. Keys to be used between PDPs can be
        distributed manually or via a standard key management protocol for
        secure key distribution.</t>

        <t>Note that where non-RSVP hops may exist in between RSVP hops, as
        well as where RSVP-capable PINs may exist in
        between PEPs, it may be difficult for the PDP to determine what is the
        destination PDP for a POLICY_DATA object contained in some RSVP
        messages (such as a Path message). This is because in those cases the
        next PEP is not known at the time of forwarding the message. In this
        situation, key shared across multiple PDPs may be used. This is
        conceptually similar to the use of a key shared across multiple RSVP
        neighbors as discussed in <xref
        target="GROUPKEYING"></xref>. We observe
        also that this issue may not exist in some deployment scenarios where
        a single (or low number of) PDP is used to control all the PEPs of a
        region (such as an administrative domain). In such scenarios, it may
        be easy for a PDP to determine what is the next-hop PDP, even when the
        next-hop PEP is not known, simply by determining what is the next
        region that will be traversed (say, based on the destination
        address).</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>As specified in <xref target="RFC2750"></xref>, standard RSVP policy
      elements (P-type values) are to be assigned by IANA as per "IETF
      Consensus" policy as outlined in <xref
      target="RFC2434"></xref> (this policy is now called "IETF Review" as per
      <xref target="RFC5226"></xref>) .</t>

      <t>IANA has allocated two P-Types from the standard RSVP policy
      element range:<list style="symbols">
          <t>0x05 ADMISSION_PRI for the Admission Priority Policy Element</t>

          <t>0x06 APP_RESOURCE_PRI for the Application-Level Resource Priority Policy
          Element</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In <xref target="appe"></xref>, the present document defines a Merge
      Strategy field inside the Admission Priority Policy Element. This
      registry is to be specified as also applicable to the Merge Strategy
      field of the Preemption Priority Policy Elements defined in <xref
      target="RFC3181"></xref>. Since it is conceivable that, in the future,
      values will be added to the registry that only apply to the Admission
      Priority Policy Element or to the Preemption Priority Policy Element
      (but not to both), IANA has listed the applicable documents for each
      value. IANA has allocated the following values: <list
          style="symbols">
          <t>0: Reserved</t>

          <t>1: Take priority of highest QoS <xref target="RFC3181"/> [RFC6401]</t>

          <t>2: Take highest priority <xref target="RFC3181"/> [RFC6401]</t>

          <t>3: Force Error on heterogeneous merge <xref target="RFC3181"/> [RFC6401]</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Following the policies outlined in <xref target="RFC5226"></xref>,
      numbers in the range 0-127 are allocated according to the "IETF Review"
      policy, numbers in the range 128-240 as "First Come First Served", and
      numbers in the range 241-255 are "Reserved for Private Use".</t>

      <t>In <xref target="appe"></xref>, the present document defines an Error
      Code field inside the Admission Priority Policy Element. IANA
      has
      created a registry for this field and allocate the following values:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>0: NO_ERROR - Value used for regular ADMISSION_PRI elements</t>

          <t>2: HETEROGENEOUS - This element encountered heterogeneous merge</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Following the policies outlined in <xref target="RFC5226"></xref>,
      numbers in the range 0-127 are allocated according to the "IETF Review"
      policy, numbers in the range 128-240 as "First Come First Served", and
      numbers in the range 241-255 are "Reserved for Private Use". Value 1 is
      Reserved (for consistency with <xref target="RFC3181"></xref> Error Code
      values).</t>

      <t>The present document defines an ALRP Namespace field in <xref
      target="alrppe"></xref> that contains a numerical value identifying the
      namespace of the application-level resource priority. The IANA already
      maintains the Resource-Priority Namespaces registry (under the SIP
      Parameters) listing all such namespaces.  That registry has been
      updated to allocate a numerical value to each namespace. To be exact, 
      the IANA has extended the Resource-Priority Namespaces
      registry in the following ways:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>A new column has been added to the registry.</t>

          <t>The title of the new column is "Namespace Numerical Value
          *".</t>

          <t>In the Legend, a line has been added stating "Namespace Numerical Value = the
          unique numerical value identifying the namespace".</t>

          <t>In the Legend, a line has been added stating "*
          : [RFC6401]".</t>

          <t>An actual numerical value has been allocated to each namespace in the
          registry and is listed in the new "Namespace Numerical Value
          *" column.</t>
        </list>A numerical value has been allocated by IANA for
      all existing namespaces.  In the future, IANA should automatically
      allocate a numerical value to any new namespace added to the
      registry.</t>

      <t>The present document defines an ALRP Priority field in <xref
      target="alrppe"></xref> that contains a numerical value identifying the
      actual application-level resource priority within the application-level
      resource priority namespace. The IANA already maintains the
      Resource-Priority Priority-Values registry (under the SIP Parameters)
      listing all such priorities. That registry has been updated to
      allocate a numerical value to each priority-value. To be exact, 
      the IANA has extended the Resource-Priority Priority-Values
      registry in the following ways:

	<list style="symbols">
          <t>For each namespace, the registry is structured with two
          columns.</t>

          <t>The title of the first column is "Priority Values (least
          to greatest)".</t>

          <t>The first column lists all the values currently defined in
          the registry (e.g., for the drsn namespace: "routine", "priority",
          "immediate", "flash", "flash-override", and "flash-override-override")</t>

          <t>The title of the second column is "Priority Numerical
          Value *".</t>

          <t>At the bottom of the registry, a "Legend" has been added
          with a line stating
          "Priority Numerical Value = the unique numerical value identifying
          the priority within a namespace".</t>

          <t>In the Legend, a line has been added stating "*
          : [RFC6401]".</t>

          <t>An actual numerical value has been allocated to each priority value and
          is listed
          in the new "Priority Numerical Value *" column.</t>
        </list>A numerical value has been allocated by IANA to
      all existing priorities.  In the future, IANA should automatically
      allocate a numerical value to any new namespace added to the registry.
      The numerical value must be unique within each namespace. Within each namespace, values should be allocated in
      decreasing order ending with 0 (so that the greatest priority is always
      allocated value 0). For example, in the drsn namespace, "routine" is
      allocated numerical value 5, and "flash-override-override" is
      allocated numerical value 0.</t>

    <section title="Examples of Bandwidth Allocation Model for Admission Priority">
      <t>Appendices A.1 and A.2 respectively illustrate how the Maximum
      Allocation Model (MAM) <xref target="RFC4125"></xref> and the Russian
      Dolls Model (RDM) <xref target="RFC4127"></xref> can be used for
      support of admission priority. The Maximum Allocation model with
      Reservation (MAR) <xref target="RFC4126"></xref> can also be used in
      a similar manner for support of admission priority. Appendix A.3
      illustrates how a simple "Priority Bypass Model" can also be used for
      support of admission priority.</t>

      <t>For simplicity, operations with only a single "priority" level
      (beyond non-priority) are illustrated here; however, the reader will
      appreciate that operations with multiple priority levels can easily be
      supported with these models.</t>

      <t>In all the figures below:<list style="empty">
          <t>"x" represents a non-priority session</t>

          <t>"o" represents a priority session</t>
        </list></t>

      <section title="Admission Priority with Maximum Allocation Model (MAM)">
        <t>This section illustrates operations of admission priority when a
        Maximum Allocation Model (MAM) is used for bandwidth allocation across
        non-priority traffic and priority traffic. A property of the Maximum
        Allocation Model is that priority traffic cannot use more than the
        bandwidth made available to priority traffic (even if the non-priority
        traffic is not using all of the bandwidth available for it).</t>

        <t><xref target="c1"></xref> shows a link that is within a
        routed network and
        conforms to this document. On this link are two amounts of bandwidth
        available to two types of traffic: non-priority and priority.</t>

        <t>If the non-priority traffic load reaches the maximum bandwidth
        available for non-priority, no additional non-priority sessions can be
        accepted even if the bandwidth reserved for priority traffic is not
        fully utilized currently.</t>

        <t>With the Maximum Allocation Model, in the case where the priority
        load reaches the maximum bandwidth reserved for priority sessions, no
        additional priority sessions can be accepted.</t>

        <t>As illustrated in <xref target="c1"></xref>, an operator may map
        the MAM to the engineered capacity limits according to different
        policies. At one extreme, where the proportion of priority traffic is
        reliably known to be fairly small at all times and where there may be
        some safety margin factored in the engineered capacity limits, the
        operator may decide to configure the bandwidth available for
        non-priority use to the full engineered capacity limits, effectively
        allowing the priority traffic to ride within the safety margin of this
        engineered capacity. This policy can be seen as an economically
        attractive approach as all of the engineered capacity is made
        available to non-priority sessions. This policy is illustrated as (1)
        in <xref target="c1"></xref>. As an example, if the engineered
        capacity limit on a given link is X, the operator may configure the
        bandwidth available to non-priority traffic to X, and the bandwidth
        available to priority traffic to 5% of X. &nbsp;At the other extreme, where
        the proportion of priority traffic may be significant at times and the
        engineered capacity limits are very tight, the operator may decide to
        configure the bandwidth available to non-priority traffic and the
        bandwidth available to priority traffic such that their sum is equal
        to the engineered capacity limits. This guarantees that the total load
        across non-priority and priority traffic is always below the
        engineered capacity and, in turn, guarantees there will never be any
        QoS degradation. However, this policy is less attractive economically
        as it prevents non-priority sessions from using the full engineered
        capacity, even when there is no or little priority load, which is the
        majority of time. This policy is illustrated as (3) in <xref
        target="c1"></xref>. As an example, if the engineered capacity limit
        on a given link is X, the operator may configure the bandwidth
        available to non-priority traffic to 95% of X, and the bandwidth
        available to priority traffic to 5% of X. &nbsp;Of course, an operator may
        also strike a balance anywhere in between these two approaches. This
        policy is illustrated as (2) in <xref target="c1"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="Admission Priority with Russian Dolls Model (RDM)">
        <t>This section illustrates operations of admission priority when a
        Russian Dolls Model (RDM) is used for bandwidth allocation across
        non-priority traffic and priority traffic. A property of the RDM is that priority traffic can use the bandwidth that is
        not currently used by non-priority traffic.</t>

        <t>As with the MAM, an operator may map the RDM onto the engineered
        capacity limits according to different policies. The operator may
        decide to configure the bandwidth available for non-priority use to

        capacity limit on a given link is X, the operator may configure the
        bandwidth available to non-priority traffic to X, and the bandwidth
        available to non-priority and priority traffic to 105% of X.</t>

        <t>Alternatively, the operator may decide to configure the bandwidth
        available to non-priority and priority traffic to the engineered
        capacity limits. As an example, if the engineered capacity limit on a
        given link is X, the operator may configure the bandwidth available to
        non-priority traffic to 95% of X, and the bandwidth available to
        non-priority and priority traffic to X.</t>

        <t>Finally, the operator may decide to strike a balance in between.
        The considerations presented for these policies in the previous

        <t><xref target="c6"></xref> shows the case where only some of the

      <section title="Admission Priority with Priority Bypass Model (PrBM)">
        <t>This section illustrates operations of admission priority when a
        simple Priority Bypass Model (PrBM) is used for bandwidth allocation
        across non-priority traffic and priority traffic. With the PrBM, non-priority traffic is subject to resource-based
        admission control, while priority traffic simply bypasses the resource-based admission control. In other words:<list style="symbols">
            <t>when a non-priority session arrives, this session is subject to
            bandwidth admission control and is accepted if the current total
            load (aggregate over non-priority and priority traffic) is below
            the engineered/allocated bandwidth.</t>

            <t>when a priority session arrives, this session is admitted
            regardless of the current load.</t>
          </list>A property of this model is that a priority session is never
        rejected.</t>

        <t>The rationale for this simple scheme is that, in practice, in some
        networks:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The volume of priority sessions is very low for the vast
            majority of time, so it may not be economical to completely set
            aside bandwidth for priority sessions and preclude the utilization
            of this bandwidth by normal sessions in normal situations.</t>

            <t>Even in congestion periods where priority sessions may be more
            heavily used, those sessions always still represent a fairly small
            proportion of the overall load that can be absorbed within the
            safety margin of the engineered capacity limits. Thus, even if
            they are admitted beyond the engineered bandwidth threshold, they
            are unlikely to result in noticeable QoS degradation.</t>
          </list> 

As with the MAM and RDM, an operator may map the PrBM onto the engineered capacity limits according to
        different policies. The operator may decide to configure the bandwidth
        limit for admission of non-priority traffic to the full engineered
        capacity limit. As an example, if the engineered capacity limit on a
        given link is X, the operator may configure the bandwidth limit for
        non-priority traffic to X. &nbsp;Alternatively, the operator may decide to
        configure the bandwidth limit for non-priority traffic to below the
        engineered capacity limits (so that the sum of the non-priority and
        priority traffic stays below the engineered capacity). As an example,
        if the engineered capacity limit on a given link is X, the operator
        may configure the bandwidth limit for non-priority traffic to 95% of
        X. &nbsp;Finally, the operator may decide to strike a balance in between.
        The considerations presented for these policies in the previous
        sections in the MAM and RDM contexts are equally applicable to the
        PrBM.</t>

    <section title="Example Usages of RSVP Extensions">
      <t>This section provides examples of how RSVP extensions defined in this
      document can be used (in conjunction with other RSVP functionality and
      SIP functionality) to enforce different hypothetical policies for
      handling prioritized sessions in a given administrative domain. This
      appendix does not provide additional specification. It is only included
      in this document for illustration purposes.</t>

      <t>We assume an environment where SIP is used for session control and
      RSVP is used for resource reservation.</t>

      <t>We refer here to "Session Queueing" as the set of "session-layer"
      capabilities that may be implemented by SIP user agents to influence
      their treatment of SIP requests. This may include the ability to "queue"
      session requests when those cannot be immediately honored (in some
      cases with the notion of "bumping", or "displacement", of less important
      session requests from that queue). It may include additional mechanisms
      such as alternate routing and exemption from certain network management controls.</t>

      <t>We only mention below the RSVP policy elements that are to be
      enforced by PEPs. It is assumed that these policy elements are set at a
      policy area boundary by PDPs. The Admission Priority and Preemption
      Priority RSVP policy elements are set by PDPs as a result of processing
      the Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element (which is carried
      in RSVP messages).</t>

      <t>If one wants to implement a prioritized service purely based on
      Session Queueing, one can achieve this by signaling prioritized
      sessions:<list style="symbols">
          <t>using the "Resource-Priority" header in SIP</t>

          <t>not using the Admission-Priority Policy Element in RSVP</t>

          <t>not using the Preemption Policy Element in RSVP</t>
        </list>If one wants to implement a prioritized service based on
      Session Queueing and "prioritized access to network-layer resources",
      one can achieve this by signaling prioritized sessions:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>using the "Resource-Priority" header in SIP</t>

          <t>using the Admission-Priority Policy Element in RSVP</t>

          <t>not using the Preemption Policy Element in RSVP</t>
        </list>Establishment of prioritized sessions will not result in
      preemption of any session. Different bandwidth allocation models can be
      used to offer different "prioritized access to network-layer
      resources". 


      Just as examples, this includes setting aside capacity exclusively for
      prioritized sessions as well as simple bypass of admission limits for
      prioritized sessions.</t>

      <t>If one wants to implement a prioritized service based on Session
      Queueing and "prioritized access to network-layer resources",
      and wants to
      ensure that (say) "Prioritized-1" sessions can preempt "Prioritized-2"
      sessions, but non-prioritized sessions are not affected by preemption,
      one can do that by signaling prioritized sessions:<list style="symbols">
          <t>using the "Resource-Priority" header in SIP</t>

          <t>using the Admission-Priority Policy Element in RSVP</t>

          <t>using the Preemption Policy Element in RSVP with:<list
              style="symbols">
              <t>setup (Prioritized-1) &gt; defending (Prioritized-2)</t>

              <t>setup (Prioritized-2) &lt;= defending (Prioritized-1)</t>

              <t>setup (Prioritized-1) &lt;= defending (Non-Prioritized)</t>

              <t>setup (Prioritized-2) &lt;= defending (Non-Prioritized)</t>
            </list></t>
        </list>If one wants to implement a prioritized service based on
      Session Queueing and "prioritized access to network-layer resources",
      and wants to ensure that prioritized sessions can preempt regular sessions, one
      could do that by signaling Prioritized sessions:<list style="symbols">
          <t>using the "Resource-Priority" header in SIP</t>

          <t>using the Admission-Priority Policy Element in RSVP</t>

          <t>using the Preemption Policy Element in RSVP with:<list
              style="symbols">
              <t>setup (Prioritized) &gt; defending (Non-Prioritized)</t>

              <t>setup (Non-Prioritized) &lt;= defending (Prioritized)</t>
            </list></t>
        </list>If one wants to implement a prioritized service based on
      Session Queueing and "prioritized access to network-layer resources",
      and wants to ensure that prioritized sessions can partially preempt regular
      sessions (i.e., reduce their reservation size), one could do that by
      signaling prioritized sessions:<list style="symbols">
          <t>using the "Resource-Priority" header in SIP</t>

          <t>using the Admission-Priority Policy Element in RSVP</t>
