      <t>
        This document specifies a set of procedures for using BGP to
        advertise that a specified router has bound a specified MPLS label
        (or a specified sequence of MPLS labels organized as a contiguous
        part of a label stack) to a specified address prefix.  This can be
        done by sending a BGP UPDATE message whose Network Layer
        Reachability Information field contains both the prefix and the MPLS
        label(s) and whose Next Hop field identifies the node at which said
        prefix is bound to said label(s).  This document obsoletes RFC 3107.

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
      <t>
        <xref target="RFC3107"/> specifies encodings and procedures for using
	BGP to indicate that a particular router has bound either a single
	MPLS label or a sequence of MPLS labels to a particular address
	prefix. (A sequence of labels would be organized as a contiguous part
	of an MPLS label stack as specified in <xref target="RFC3031"/> and
	<xref target="RFC3032"/>.)
        This is done by sending a BGP UPDATE message
        whose Network Layer Reachability Information field contains both the
        prefix and the MPLS label(s) and whose Next Hop field identifies the
        node at which said prefix is bound to said label(s). Each such UPDATE
        also advertises a path to the specified prefix via the specified next
        hop.
      </t>
      <t>        
        Although there are many implementations and deployments of <xref
        target="RFC3107"/>, there are a number of issues with it that have
        impeded interoperability in the past and may potentially impede
        interoperability in the future:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            Although <xref target="RFC3107"/> specifies an encoding that
            allows a sequence of MPLS labels (rather than just a single
            label) to be bound to a prefix, it does not specify the
            semantics of binding a sequence of labels to a prefix.
          </t>
          <t>
            Many implementations of <xref target="RFC3107"/> assume that
            only one label will be bound to a prefix, and cannot properly
            process a BGP UPDATE message that binds a sequence of labels to
            a prefix.  Thus, an implementation attempting to provide this
            feature is likely to experience problems interoperating with
            other implementations.
          </t>
          <t>
            The procedures in <xref target="RFC3107"/> for withdrawing the
            binding of a label or sequence of labels to a prefix are not
            specified clearly and correctly.
          </t>
          <t>
            <xref target="RFC3107"/> specifies an optional feature, known as
            "Advertising Multiple Routes to a Destination", that, to the
            best of the author's knowledge, has never been implemented as
            specified.  The functionality that this feature was intended to
            provide can and has been implemented in a different way using
            the procedures of <xref target="RFC7911"/>, which were not
            available at the time that <xref target="RFC3107"/> was written.
            In <xref target="RFC3107"/>, this feature was controlled by a
            BGP Capability Code that has never been implemented and is now
            deprecated; see <xref target="iana_cons"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
            It is possible for a BGP speaker to receive two BGP UPDATEs that
            advertise paths to the same address prefix, where one UPDATE
            binds a label (or sequence of labels) to the prefix and the
            other does not.  <xref target="RFC3107"/> is silent on the issue
            of how the presence of two such UPDATEs impacts the BGP decision
            process and does not say explicitly whether one or the other or
            both of these UPDATEs should be propagated.  This has led
            different implementations to handle this situation in different
            ways.
          </t>

          <t>
            Much of <xref target="RFC3107"/> applies to the VPN-IPv4 (<xref
            target="RFC4364"/>) and VPN-IPv6 (<xref target="RFC4659"/>)
            address families, but those address families are not mentioned
            in it.

      </t>
      <t>
        This document replaces and obsoletes <xref target="RFC3107"/>.  It
        defines a new BGP Capability to be used when binding a sequence of
        labels to a prefix; by using this Capability, the interoperability
        problems alluded to above can be avoided.  This document also
        removes the unimplemented "Advertising Multiple Routes to a
        Destination" feature (see Section 4 of <xref target="RFC3107"/>),
        while specifying how to use <xref target="RFC7911"/> to provide the
        same functionality. This document also addresses the issue of the
        how UPDATEs that bind labels to a given prefix interact with UPDATEs
        that advertise paths to that prefix but do not bind labels to it.
        However, for backwards compatibility, it declares most of these
        interactions to be matters of local policy.
      </t>
      <t>
        The places where this specification differs from <xref
        target="RFC3107"/> are indicated in the text.  It is believed that
        implementations that conform to the current document will
        interoperate correctly with existing deployed implementations of
        <xref target="RFC3107"/>.

    <section title="Using BGP to Bind an Address Prefix to One or More MPLS
                    Labels" anchor="binding">
      <t>
        BGP may be used to advertise that a particular node (call it N) has
        bound a particular MPLS label, or a particular sequence of MPLS
        labels (organized as a contiguous part of an MPLS label stack), to a
        particular address prefix.  This is done by sending a Multiprotocol
        BGP UPDATE message, i.e., an UPDATE message with an MP_REACH_NLRI
        attribute as specified in <xref target="RFC4760"/>.  The Network Address of Next
        Hop field of that attribute contains an IP address of node N.  The
        label(s) and the prefix are encoded in the Network Layer Reachability
	Information (NLRI) field of the
        MP_REACH_NLRI.  The encoding of the NLRI field is specified in
        Sections <xref target="single" format="counter"/> and <xref
        target="multiple" format="counter"/>.
      </t>
      <t>      
        If the prefix is an IPv4 address prefix or a VPN-IPv4 (<xref
        target="RFC4364"/>) address prefix, the Address Family Identifier
        (AFI) of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute is set to 1.  If the prefix is
        an IPv6 address prefix or a VPN-IPv6 prefix (<xref
        target="RFC4659"/>), the AFI is set to 2.
      </t>
      <t>
        If the prefix is an IPv4 address prefix or an IPv6 address prefix,
        the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) field is set to 4.
        If the prefix is a VPN-IPv4 address prefix or a VPN-IPv6 address
        prefix, the SAFI is set to 128.
      </t>
      <t>
        The use of SAFI 4 or SAFI 128 when the AFI is other than 1 or 2 is
        outside the scope of this document.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document does not specify the format of the Network Address of
        Next Hop field of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute.  The format of the
        Next Hop field depends upon a number of factors and is discussed in
        a number of other RFCs: see <xref target="RFC4364"/>, <xref
        target="RFC4659"/>, <xref target="RFC4798"/>, and <xref
        target="RFC5549"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        There are a variety of applications that make use of alternative
        methods of using BGP to advertise MPLS label bindings: see, e.g.,
        <xref target="RFC7432"/>, <xref target="RFC6514"/>, or <xref
        target="TUNNEL-ENCAPS"/>.  The method described in the current
        document is not claimed to be the only way of using BGP to advertise
        MPLS label bindings.  Discussion of which method to use for which
        application is outside the scope of the current document.
      </t>
      <t>
        In the remainder of this document, we will use the term "SAFI-x
        UPDATE" to refer to a BGP UPDATE message containing an MP_REACH_NLRI
        attribute or an MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute (<xref target="RFC4760"/>)
        whose SAFI field contains the value x.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document defines a BGP Optional Capabilities parameter (<xref
        target="RFC5492"/>) known as the Multiple Labels Capability.
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            Unless this Capability is sent on a given BGP session by both of
            that session's BGP speakers, a SAFI-4 or SAFI-128 UPDATE message
            sent on that session from either speaker MUST bind a prefix to
            only a single label and MUST use the encoding of <xref
            target="single"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
            If this Capability is sent by both BGP speakers on a given
            session, an UPDATE message on that session, from either speaker,
            MUST use the encoding of <xref target="multiple"/> and MAY bind
            a prefix to a sequence of more than one label.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        The encoding of the Multiple Labels Capability is specified in <xref
        target="capability"/>. 
      </t>
      <t>
        Procedures for explicitly withdrawing a label binding are given in
        <xref target="withdraw"/>.  Procedures for changing the label(s)
        bound to a given prefix by a given node are given in <xref
        target="changing"/>. 
      </t>
      <t>
        Procedures for propagating SAFI-4 and SAFI-128 UPDATEs are discussed
        in <xref target="propagating"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        <!-- [ECR] changed "update" to "UPDATE" below -->
        When a BGP speaker installs and propagates a SAFI-4 or SAFI-128
        UPDATE, and if it changes the value of the Network Address of Next
        Hop field, it must program its data plane appropriately.  This is
        discussed in <xref target="dataplane"/>.
      </t>

      
      <section title="Multiple Labels Capability" anchor="capability">
        <t>
         <xref target="RFC5492"/> defines the "Capabilities Optional
         Parameter".  A BGP speaker can include a Capabilities Optional
         Parameter in a BGP OPEN message.  The Capabilities Optional
         Parameter is a triple that includes a one-octet Capability Code, a
         one-octet Capability length, and a variable-length Capability
         Value.
        </t>
        <t>
          This document defines a Capability Code known as the Multiple
          Labels Capability code.  IANA has assigned value 8 to this
          Capability Code.  (This Capability Code is new to this document
          and does not appear in <xref target="RFC3107"/>.)
        </t>
        <t>
          If a BGP speaker has not sent the Multiple Labels Capability in its
          BGP OPEN message on a particular BGP session, or if it has not
          received the Multiple Labels Capability in the BGP OPEN message
          from its peer on that BGP session, that BGP speaker MUST NOT send
          on that session any UPDATE message that binds more than one MPLS
          label to any given prefix.  Further, when advertising the binding
          of a single label to a prefix, the BGP speaker MUST use the
          encoding specified in <xref target="single"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          The value field of the Multiple Labels Capability (shown in <xref
          target="multilabels"/>) consists of one or more triples, where
          each triple consists of four octets.  The first two octets of a
          triple specify an AFI value, the third octet specifies a SAFI
          value, and the fourth specifies a Count.  If one of the triples is
          &lt;AFI, SAFI, Count&gt;, the Count is the maximum number of labels
          that the BGP speaker sending the Capability can process in a
          received UPDATE of the specified AFI/SAFI.  If the Count is 255,
          then no limit has been placed on the number of labels that can be
          processed in a received UPDATE of the specified AFI/SAFI.
        </t>
        <t>
          Any implementation that sends a Multiple Labels Capability MUST be
          able to support at least two labels in the NLRI.  However, there
          may be deployment scenarios in which a larger number of labels is
          needed.

          describes a procedure that allows routes learned over a given BGP
          session to be maintained when the session fails and then restarts.
          This procedure requires the entire RIB to be transmitted when the
          session restarts.  If the Multiple Labels Capability for a given
          AFI/SAFI was exchanged on the failed session but has not been
          exchanged on the restarted session, then any prefixes advertised
          in that AFI/SAFI with multiple labels MUST be explicitly
          withdrawn.  Similarly, if the maximum label count (specified in
          the Capability for a given AFI/SAFI) is reduced, any prefixes
          advertised with more labels than are valid for the current session
          MUST be explicitly withdrawn.

        Upon transmission, the Compatibility field SHOULD be set to

      <t>
        This encoding is used for explicitly withdrawing the binding (on a
        given BGP session) between the specified prefix and whatever label
        or sequence of labels had previously been bound by the procedures
        of this document to that prefix on the given session.  This
        encoding is used whether or not the Multiple Labels Capability has
        been sent or received on the session.  Note that label/prefix
        bindings that were not advertised on the given session cannot be
        withdrawn by this method. (However, if the bindings were advertised
        on a previous session with the same peer, and the current session is
        the result of a "graceful restart" (<xref target="RFC4724"/>) of the
        previous session, then this withdrawal method may be used.)
      </t>
      <t>
        When using an MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute to withdraw a route whose
        NLRI was previously specified in an MP_REACH_NLRI attribute, the
        lengths and values of the respective prefixes must match, and the
        respective AFI/SAFIs must match.  If the procedures of <xref
        target="RFC7911"/> are being used, the respective values of the
        "path identifier" fields must match as well. Note that the prefix
        length is not the same as the NLRI length; to determine the prefix
        length of a prefix in an MP_UNREACH_NLRI, the length of the
        Compatibility field must be subtracted from the length of the NLRI.
      </t>
      <t>
        An explicit withdrawal in a SAFI-x UPDATE on a given BGP session not
        only withdraws the binding between the prefix and the label(s), it
        also withdraws the path to that prefix that was previously
        advertised in a SAFI-x UPDATE on that session.
      </t>

      <t>
        <xref target="RFC3107"/> made it possible to specify a particular
        label value in the Compatibility field.  However, the functionality
        that required the presence of a particular label value (or sequence
        of label values) was never implemented, and that functionality is
        not present in the current document. Hence, the value of this field
        is of no significance; there is never any reason for this field to
        contain a label value or a sequence of label values.
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref target="RFC3107"/> also made it possible to withdraw a binding
        without specifying the label explicitly, by setting the
        Compatibility field to 0x800000.  However, some implementations set
        it to 0x000000.  In order to ensure backwards compatibility, it is
        RECOMMENDED by this document that the Compatibility field be set to
        0x800000, but it is REQUIRED that it be ignored upon reception.

        this as an indication that N1 has at least two paths to P, and S1 MAY
        use this fact to do load-balancing of any traffic that it has to

          speaker must attend to the information provided by the Multiple
          Labels Capability (see <xref target="capability"/>).  A BGP
          speaker MUST NOT send multiple labels to a peer with which it has
          not exchanged the Multiple Labels Capability and MUST NOT send
          more labels to a given peer than the peer has announced (via the
          Multiple Labels Capability) than it can handle.

        <t>
          It is possible that a BGP speaker's local policy will tell it to
          encode N labels in a given route's NLRI before propagating the
          route, but that one of the BGP speaker's peers cannot handle N
          labels in the NLRI.  In this case, the BGP speaker has two

      In the following, we will use the phrase "node S tunnels packet P to
      node N", where packet P is an MPLS packet.  By this phrase, we mean
      that node S encapsulates packet P and causes packet P to be delivered
      to node N in such a way that P's label stack before encapsulation
      will be seen unchanged by N but will not be seen by the nodes (if
      any) between S and N.
    </t>
    <t>
      If the tunnel is a Label Switched Path (LSP), encapsulating the packet
      may be as simple as pushing on another MPLS label.  If node N is a
      Layer 2 adjacency of node S, a Layer 2 encapsulation may be all that
      is needed.  Other sorts of tunnels (e.g., IP tunnels, GRE tunnels, UDP
      tunnels) may also be used, depending upon the particular deployment
      scenario.
    </t>
    <t>
      Suppose BGP speaker S1 receives a SAFI-4 or SAFI-128 BGP UPDATE with
      an MP_REACH_NLRI specifying label L1, prefix P, and next hop N1, and
      suppose S1 installs this route as its (or one of its) best path(s)
      towards P. And suppose S1 propagates this route after changing the next
      hop to itself and changing the label to L2.  Suppose further that
      S1 receives an MPLS data packet and, in the process of forwarding that
      MPLS data packet, S1 sees label L2 rise to the top of the packet's
      label stack.  Then, to forward the packet further, S1 must replace L2
      with L1 as the top entry in the packet's label stack, and S1 must then
      tunnel the packet to N1.
    </t>
    <t>
      Suppose that the route received by S1 specified not a single label,
      but a sequence of k labels &lt;L11, L12, ..., L1k&gt; where L11 is
      the first label appearing in the NLRI, and L1k is the last.  And
      suppose again that S1 propagates this route after changing the next
      hop to itself and changing the Label field to the single label L2.
      Suppose further that S1 receives an MPLS data packet, and in the
      process of forwarding that MPLS data packet, S1 sees label L2 rise to
      the top of the packet's label stack.  In this case, instead of simply
      replacing L2 with L1, S1 removes L2 from the top of the label stack
      and then pushes labels L1k through L11 onto the label stack such that
      L11 is now at the top of the label stack.  Then, S1 must tunnel the
      packet to N1.  (Note that L1k will not be at the bottom of the
      packet's label stack and hence will not have the "bottom of stack"
      bit set unless L2 had previously been at the bottom of the packet's
      label stack.)
    </t>
    <t>
      The above paragraph assumes that when S1 propagates a SAFI-4 or
      SAFI-128 route after setting the next hop to itself, it replaces the
      label or labels specified in the NLRI of that route with a single
      label.  However, it is also possible, as determined by local policy,
      for a BGP speaker to specify multiple labels when it propagates a
      SAFI-4 or SAFI-128 route after setting the next hop to itself.
    </t>
    <t>
      Suppose, for example, that S1 supports context labels (<xref
      target="RFC5331"/>).  Let L21 be a context label supported by S1, and
      let L22 be a label that is in the label space identified (at S1) by
      L21.  Suppose S1 receives a SAFI-4 or SAFI-128 UPDATE whose prefix is
      P, whose Label field is &lt;L11, L12, ..., L1k&gt; and whose next hop is
      N1.  Before propagating the UPDATE, S1 may set the next hop to itself
      (by replacing N1 with S1) and may replace the label stack
      &lt;L11, L12, ..., L1k&gt; with the pair of labels &lt;L21, L22&gt;.
    </t>
    <t>
      In this case, if S1 receives an MPLS data packet whose top label
      is L21 and whose second label is L22, S1 will remove both L21 and L22
      from the label stack and replace them with &lt;L11, L12, ..., L1k&gt;.
      Note that the fact that L21 is a context label is known only to S1;
      other BGP speakers do not know how S1 will interpret L21 (or L22).
    </t>
    <t>
      The ability to replace one or more labels by one or more labels can
      provide great flexibility, but it must be done carefully.  Let's suppose
      again that S1 receives an UPDATE that specifies prefix P, label stack
      &lt;L11, L12, ..., L1k&gt;, and next hop N1. 
      And suppose that S1
      propagates this UPDATE to BGP speaker S2 after setting next hop self
      and after replacing the Label field with
      &lt;L21, L22, ..., L2k&gt;.  Finally, suppose that S1 programs its
      data plane so that when it processes a received MPLS packet whose top
      label is L21, it replaces L21 with &lt;L11, L12, ..., L1k&gt; and then
      tunnels the packet to N1.
    </t>
    <t>
      In this case, BGP speaker S2 will have received a route with prefix P,
      Label field &lt;L21, L22, ..., L2k&gt;, and next hop S1.  If S2 decides
      to forward an IP packet according to this route, it will push
      &lt;L21, L22, ..., L2k&gt; onto the packet's label stack and tunnel the
      packet to S1.  S1 will replace L21 with &lt;L11, L12, ..., L1k&gt; and
      will tunnel the packet to N1. N1 will receive the packet with the
      following label stack: &lt;L11, L12, ..., L1k, L22, ..., L2k&gt;.  While this
      may be useful in certain scenarios, it may provide unintended results
      in other scenarios.

    <t>
      Procedures for choosing, setting up, maintaining, or determining the
      liveness of a particular tunnel or type of tunnel are outside the

      When pushing labels onto a packet's label stack, the Time-to-Live
      (TTL) field (<xref target="RFC3032"/>, <xref target="RFC3443"/>) and

      target="RFC5462"/>) of each label stack entry must, of course, be set.

      This document does not specify any new rules for processing the label

      It is a matter of local policy whether SAFI-4 routes can be used as
      the basis for forwarding IP packets or whether SAFI-4 routes can only
      be used for forwarding MPLS packets.  If BGP speaker S1 is forwarding
      IP packets according to SAFI-4 routes, then consider an IP packet with
      destination address D, such that P is the "longest prefix match" for D
      from among the routes that are being used to forward IP packets.  And
      suppose the packet is being forwarded according to a SAFI-4 route
      whose prefix is P, whose next hop is N1 and whose sequence of labels
      is L1. To forward the packet according to this route, S1 must create a
      label stack for the packet, push on the sequence of labels L1, and
      then tunnel the packet to N1.

  <section title="Relationship between SAFI-4 and SAFI-1 Routes"
           anchor="safis14">
    <t>
      It is possible that a BGP speaker will receive both a SAFI-1 route for
      prefix P and a SAFI-4 route for prefix P.  Different implementations
      treat this situation in different ways.
    </t>
    <t>
      For example, some implementations may regard SAFI-1 routes and SAFI-4
      routes as completely independent and may treat them in a "ships in
      the night" fashion.  In this case, best-path selection for the two
      SAFIs is independent, and there will be a best SAFI-1 route to P as
      well as a best SAFI-4 route to P.  Which packets get forwarded
      according to the routes of which SAFI is then a matter of local
      policy.
    </t>
    <t>
      Other implementations may treat the SAFI-1 and SAFI-4 routes for a
      given prefix as comparable, such that the best route to prefix P is
      either a SAFI-1 route or a SAFI-4 route but not both.  In such
      implementations, if load-balancing is done among a set of equal cost
      routes, some of the equal cost routes may be SAFI-1 routes and some
      may be SAFI-4 routes.  Whether this is allowed is, again, a matter of
      local policy.
    </t>
    <t>
      Some implementations may allow a single BGP session to carry UPDATEs
      of both SAFI-1 and SAFI-4; other implementations may disallow this.
      Some implementations that allow both SAFIs on the same session may
      treat the receipt of a SAFI-1 route for prefix P on a given session as
      an implicit withdrawal of a previous SAFI-4 route for prefix P on that
      session, and vice versa. Other implementations may have different
      behavior. 
    </t>
    <t>
      A BGP speaker may receive a SAFI-4 route over a given BGP session but
      may have other BGP sessions for which SAFI-4 is not enabled.  In this
      case, the BGP speaker MAY convert the SAFI-4 route to a SAFI-1 route
      and then propagate the result over the session on which SAFI-4 is not
      enabled.  Whether this is done is a matter of local policy.
    </t>
    <t>
      These differences in the behavior of different implementations may
      result in unexpected behavior or lack of interoperability. In some
      cases, it may be difficult or impossible to achieve the desired
      policies with certain implementations or combinations of
      implementations.

  <section title="Security Considerations">
    <t>
      The security considerations of BGP (as specified in <xref
      target="RFC4271"/>) apply.
    </t>
    <t>
      If a BGP implementation that is not conformant with the current document
      encodes multiple labels in the NLRI but has not sent and received the
      Multiple Labels Capability, a BGP implementation that does conform
      with the current document will likely reset the BGP session.
    </t>
    <t>
      This document specifies that certain data packets be "tunneled" from
      one BGP speaker to another.  This requires that the packets be
      encapsulated while in flight.  This document does not specify the
      encapsulation to be used.  However, if a particular encapsulation is
      used, the security considerations of that encapsulation are applicable.
    </t>
    <t>
      If a particular tunnel encapsulation does not provide integrity and
      authentication, it is possible that a data packet's label stack can be
      modified, through error or malfeasance, while the packet is in flight.
      This can result in misdelivery of the packet.  It should be noted that
      the tunnel encapsulation (MPLS) most commonly used in deployments of
      this specification does not provide integrity or authentication;
      neither do the other tunnel encapsulations mentioned in <xref
      target="dataplane"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
      There are various techniques one can use to constrain the distribution
      of BGP UPDATE messages.  If a BGP UPDATE advertises the binding of a
      particular label or set of labels to a particular address prefix, such
      techniques can be used to control the set of BGP speakers that are
      intended to learn of that binding.  However, if BGP sessions do not
      provide privacy, other routers may learn of that binding.  
    </t>
    <t>
      When a BGP speaker processes a received MPLS data packet whose top
      label it advertised, there is no guarantee that the label in question
      was put on the packet by a router that was intended to know about that
      label binding.  If a BGP speaker is using the procedures of this
      document, it may be useful for that speaker to distinguish its
      "internal" interfaces from its "external" interfaces and to avoid
      advertising the same labels to BGP speakers reached on internal
      interfaces as to BGP speakers reached on external interfaces.  Then, a
      data packet can be discarded if its top label was not advertised over
      the type of interface from which the packet was received.  This
      reduces the likelihood of forwarding packets whose labels have been
      "spoofed" by untrusted sources.

<abstract><t>RFC 5512 defines a BGP Path Attribute known as the "Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute".  This attribute allows one to specify a set of tunnels.  For each such tunnel, the attribute can provide the information needed to create the tunnel and the corresponding encapsulation header.  The attribute can also provide information that aids in choosing whether a particular packet is to be sent through a particular tunnel.  RFC 5512 states that the attribute is only carried in BGP UPDATEs that have the "Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family (Encapsulation SAFI)".  This document deprecates the Encapsulation SAFI (which has never been used in production), and specifies semantics for the attribute when it is carried in UPDATEs of certain other SAFIs.  This document adds support for additional tunnel types, and allows a remote tunnel endpoint address to be specified for each tunnel.  This document also provides support for specifying fields of any inner or outer encapsulations that may be used by a particular tunnel.  This document obsoletes RFC 5512.</t></abstract>
