<abstract><t>SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) utilizes X.509v3 certificates for
performing router authorization. This document specifies a certificate profile
for SEND based on resource certificates along with extended key usage values
required for SEND.</t></abstract>

</front>

<middle>

<section title="Introduction">
<t>SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) <xref target="RFC3971"/> utilizes X.509v3
certificates that include the <xref target="RFC3779"></xref> extension for IPv6
addresses to certify a router&apos;s authorization to advertise the IPv6 prefix for
the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol. The SEND specification defines a basic
certificate profile for SEND. The certificate profile defined in this document
supersedes the profile for Router Authorization Certificates specified in <xref
target="RFC3971"/>. That is, certificates used in SEND (by routers, proxies, or
address owners) MUST conform to this certificate profile and MAY conform to the
original profile in <xref target="RFC3971"/>.</t>

<t>The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is the global PKI that attests
to the allocation of IP address space. The RPKI represents the centralized
model discussed in Section 6.2 of <xref target="RFC3971"/>. Consequently, SEND
will use the RPKI certificate profile and certificate validation detailed in
<xref target="RFC6487"></xref>. Consequently, the certificate validation
method described in <xref target="RFC3971"/> is updated with the
certificate validation method in <xref target="RFC6487"></xref>. </t>

<t>Since the <xref target="RFC3779"/> IPv6 address extension does not mention what functions
the node can perform for the certified IPv6 space, it becomes impossible to
know the reason for which the certificate was issued. In order to facilitate
issuance of certificates for specific functions, it is necessary to utilize the
ExtKeyUsageSyntax field (optional in RPKI certificates) of the X.509
certificate to mention why the certificate was issued. This
document specifies four extended key usage values -- one for routers, two for
proxies, and one for address owners -- for use with SEND.</t>

<t>In RFC 3971, two deployment models were described: centralized and
decentralized. This document describes the different deployment models that can
be used with the SEND certificates defined here. </t>

</section>

<section title="SEND Certificate Profile">
<t>SEND certificates MUST comply with the RPKI resource profile described
in <xref target="RFC6487"></xref>. A Router Authorization Certificate
example is included in Appendix A.</t>

<t>In Sections 2, 4.9.10, and 4.9.11 of <xref
target="RFC6487"></xref>, it is stated that RFC 3779 resource
extensions MUST be marked as critical and MUST be present in all resource
certificates. 

SEND certificates MUST include the IP Address Delegation extension <xref
target="RFC3779"/>.

 This extension MUST include at least one address block for
the IPv6 Address Family (AFI=0002), as described in Section 4.9.10 of <xref
target="RFC6487"></xref>. SEND certificates MUST NOT have more
than one IP Address Delegation extension.</t>


<section title="Unconstrained Certified Subnet Prefixes">
<t>Section 7.3 of <xref target="RFC3971"/> defines the Unconstrained Certified
subnet prefixes category by using certificates containing either the null
prefix or no prefix extension at all.</t>

<t>When using the RPKI certificate profile, prefix extensions are mandatory and the
null prefix MUST be validated. However, a certificate may inherit its parent's
prefix or range by using the "inherit" element for the IPv6 Address Family
Identifier (AFI) as defined in
<xref target="RFC3779"/>. The use of the "inherit" element is permitted in <xref
target="RFC6487"></xref>.</t>

<t>Consequently, this document updates Section 7.3 of <xref target="RFC3971"/>,
adding the following text under Unconstrained:</t>

<t>Network operators that do not want to constrain routers to route particular
subnet prefixes, but rather inherit those prefixes from the routers' parent
certificates, should
configure routers with certificates containing the "inherit" element for the
IPv6 AFI.</t>

</section>
</section>

<section title="Deployment Models">
<t>RFC 3971 describes two deployment models: centralized and
decentralized. These models were differentiated by having one trust anchor or many trust
anchors. In this document, we introduce two new deployment models not based on
the number of trust anchors but on the localization of the SEND deployment.</t>

<t>The local SEND deployment model represents those cases where SEND deployment
is confined to an administrative domain. In this scenario, the deployment of
SEND MAY be done independently of the existence of deployment in the upper RPKI
hierarchy (i.e., an end user could perform local SEND deployment without the
need for RPKI deployment in its ISP). This model requires the use of local trust
anchors and configuring islands of trust. This model MAY include Unique Local
Addresses (ULAs) <xref target="RFC4193"/>.</t>

<t>The public SEND deployment models represent those cases where SEND
deployment is linked to RPKI deployment as described in <xref
target="RFC6480"></xref>. Trust anchor material MAY be part of a
different administrative domain (i.e., RIRs, NIRs, or ISPs).
It is a global model suitable for mobile users.</t>

<t>These two models are not mutually exclusive. It is entirely possible to have
a hybrid model that incorporates features from both of these models. In one such
hybrid deployment model, most IP address resources (e.g., global unicast
addresses) would be certified under the global RPKI, while some others (e.g.,
ULAs) are certified under local trust anchors.</t>

</section>

<section title="Trust Anchor Material">
<t>Relying parties (e.g., end hosts that implement SEND and process these
router certificates) MUST be configured with one or more trust anchors to
enable validation of the routers' certificates. <xref target="RFC6495"></xref>
and Section&nbsp;6.5 of <xref target="RFC3971"/> list the trust
anchor configuration options for end hosts using SEND.</t>

<t>In the local SEND deployment model, it is possible to use as a trust anchor a
certificate that includes in its RFC 3779 address extension the prefix ::/0. In
this case, no new trust anchor material would be needed when
renumbering. However, if trying to move from the local deployment model to the
public deployment model, new trust anchor material will have to be distributed
to relying parties.</t>

</section>

<section title="Extended Key Usage Values" anchor="ext-key-usage-val">
<t>
The Internet PKI document <xref target="RFC5280"/> specifies the extended key
usage X.509 certificate extension. The extension indicates one or more purposes
for which the certified public key may be used. The extended key usage
extension can be used in conjunction with the key usage extension, which
indicates
the intended purpose of the certified public key. The EKU extension is defined
as optional in <xref target="RFC6487"></xref> for end-entity
certificates but MUST be present when issuing end-entity certificates for SEND.</t>

<t>The extended key usage extension syntax is repeated here for
convenience:</t>

<list>
<t>ExtKeyUsageSyntax ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF KeyPurposeId</t>
<t>KeyPurposeId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER</t>
</list>

<t>This specification defines four KeyPurposeId values: one for authorizing
routers (Router Authorization Certificates), two for authorizing proxies
(Secure Proxy ND Certificates), and one for address owners (Owner Authorization
Certificates). Additional KeyPurposeId values may be specified in Standards
Track documents.</t>

<t>
The inclusion of the router authorization value (id-kp-sendRouter) indicates
that the certificate has been issued for allowing the router to generate 
Router Advertisement (RA) and
Redirect messages for any prefix(es) encompassed (as defined in Section 7.1 of
<xref target="RFC6487"></xref>) by the IP address space
included in the X.509 extensions for IP addresses.</t>

<t>
The inclusion of the proxied routing authorization value
(id&nbhy;kp&nbhy;sendProxiedRouter)
indicates that the certificate has been issued for allowing the proxy
to perform proxying of RA and Redirect messages for any prefix(es)
encompassed by the IP address space included in the X.509 extensions for IP addresses.</t>

<t>
The inclusion of the owner authorization value (id-kp-sendOwner) indicates
that the certificate has been issued for allowing the node to use any
address(es) that is/are encompassed by the IP address space included in the
X.509 extensions for IP addresses. For an address in such a certificate, the
node can assign the address to an interface; send/receive traffic from/to this
address; and send/respond to NS, NA, and RS messages related to that address.
</t>

<t>
The inclusion of the proxied owner authorization value
(id&nbhy;kp&nbhy;sendProxiedOwner)
indicates that the certificate has been issued for allowing the proxy to
perform proxying of Neighbor Solicitation (NS), Neighbor Advertisement (NA),
and Router Solicitation (RS) messages for any address encompassed by the
IP address space included in the X.509 extensions for IP addresses.</t>

   id-kp-sendOwner OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp 25 }

   id-kp-sendProxiedOwner OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp 26 }
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>As described in <xref target="RFC6487"></xref>, the extended key usage extension, if present, MUST be non-critical.</t>

<t>Relying parties MUST require the extended key usage extension to be
present in a certificate, and they MAY require a particular KeyPurposeId
value to be present (such as id-kp-sendRouter or
id&nbhy;kp&nbhy;sendProxiedRouter) within the extended key
usage extension. If multiple KeyPurposeId values are included, the relying
parties need not recognize all of them, as long as the required KeyPurposeId
value is present. Relying parties MUST reject certificates that do not contain
at least one SEND KeyPurposeId, even if they include the anyExtendedKeyUsage
OID defined in <xref target="RFC5280"/>.</t>

</section>

<section title="CRL Profile and Revocation">
<t>RPKI requires the use of Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) <xref
target="RFC6487"></xref>. The host will obtain the necessary
CRLs and perform the certificate validation method described in <xref
target="RFC6487"/>. </t>

<section title="Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Considerations">
<t>A host MAY use OCSP <xref target="RFC2560"/> to verify the
revocation status of a certificate.</t>

<t>As <xref target="RFC6487"></xref> is adopted as the base
certificate profile for SEND, the host SHOULD NOT assume that certificates will
include the URI of an OCSP server as part of its Authority Information
Access (AIA) extension. 

This is particularly evident in the SEND public deployment
model, as OCSP services are not required by <xref target="RFC6484"></xref>.</t>

</section>
</section>

<section anchor="validation" title="Certificate Validation">
<t>This section updates Section 6.3.1 of <xref target="RFC3971"/> by
introducing new validations without introducing any conflict.</t>

<t>The host MUST perform the certificate validation method described in <xref
target="RFC6487"></xref>. The validation of certificates that
use the "inherit" element where the existence of a parent prefix or range is
required is described in <xref target="RFC3779"/>.</t>

<t>The host MUST verify that the KeyPurposeId value corresponding to the
Neighbor Discovery message type is present, as described in
<xref target="ext-key-usage-val"/>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
<t>This document makes use of object identifiers to identify EKUs and the ASN.1
(Abstract Syntax Notation One) module found in <xref target="APPB"/>. The EKUs
and ASN.1 module OID are registered in an arc delegated by IANA to the PKIX
Working Group.</t>

</section>
<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>The certification authority needs to ensure that the correct values for the
extended key usage are inserted in each certificate that is issued. Relying
parties may accept or reject a particular certificate for an intended use based
on the information provided in these extensions. Incorrect representation of
the information in the extended key usage field can cause the relying party to
reject an otherwise appropriate certificate or accept a certificate that ought
to be rejected. In particular, since a SEND certificate attests that its
subject is authorized to play a given role in the SEND protocol, certificates
that contain incorrect EKU values can enable some of the same attacks that SEND
was meant to prevent. For example, if a malicious host can obtain a certificate
that authorizes it to act as a router for a given prefix, then it can
masquerade as a router for that prefix, e.g., in order to attract traffic from
local nodes.</t>
