      <t>This document defines the standard media type used by the Content
      Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) protocol suite,
      including the registration procedure and recommended usage of
      the required payload-type parameter.</t>

    <section title="Introduction and Scope">
      <t>The Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) working group is developing a set of protocols to
      enable the interconnection of multiple content delivery networks (CDNs),
      as discussed in <xref target="RFC6770"/>.  The CDNI protocol
      suite consists of multiple HTTP-based interfaces, many of which
      transfer various payloads encoded in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) <xref target="RFC7159"/>.  The main interfaces
      (i.e., CDNI Control interface, CDNI Footprint &amp; Capabilities
      Advertisement interface, CDNI Request Routing Redirection
      interface, CDNI Metadata interface, and CDNI Logging interface) are
      described in <xref target="RFC7336"/>.  It is desirable to be
      able to indicate the type of object carried in the HTTP
      entity-body without having to register separate media types for
      each CDNI object.  To accomplish this aim, this document
      defines a single new media type for CDNI that includes a
      required payload-type parameter.  A separate registry of CDNI
      payload-type parameters is also defined.  CDNI protocol
      specifications may register interface-specific payload types,
      specifying the payload encoding and parsing semantics for that
      message (e.g., JSON serialization for a CDNI metadata object).
      The same payload-type parameter may also be used as
      references for other purposes (e.g., referencing CDNI metadata
      objects from CDNI capability advertisement objects).</t>

          <t>CDNI interfaces that return encoded data may be
          (mis)interpreted if parsed by non-CDNI or non-compliant CDNI
          implementations.  In addition, CDNI logging information is
          likely to transfer large amounts of data that may overload
          unexpecting clients.  The individual CDNI interface
          specifications provide more detailed analysis of security
          and privacy concerns, and define the requirements for
          authentication, authorization, confidentiality, integrity,
          and privacy for each interface.</t>
          <t>The application/cdni media type is a generic media type
          to be used by multiple CDNI interfaces for transporting
          different types of control and logging information.  Proper
          validation of message data requires parsing and
          understanding the ptype parameter and the associated data
          encoding.  Failure to properly validate payloads may allow
          data extrusion under the auspices of the application/cdni

      <section anchor="iana.PayloadType" title="CDNI Payload-Types Parameters Registry">
        <t>IANA has created a new "CDNI Payload Types"
        subregistry within the "Content Delivery Networks
        Interconnection (CDNI) Parameters" registry.
        The "CDNI Payload Types" namespace defines the valid
        values for the required "ptype" parameter of the
        "application/cdni" media type. 

      The CDNI payload type is an ASCII string value that
      consists of only visible (printing) characters but excludes equal
      signs (=), double quotes ("), and semicolons (;).  It will not
      exceed 256 characters in length.
The following Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) definition of the CDNI payload
type is provided for clarity <xref target="RFC5234" />

     ptype-char = %x21 / %x23-3A / %x3C / %x3E-7E
       ; Includes ALPHA, DIGIT, and other printables
       ; Excludes equal signs (=), double quotes ("), semicolons (;)
]]></artwork>
        </figure></t>

        <t>Additions to the "CDNI Payload
        Types" namespace will be made via "Specification Required" as
        defined in <xref target="RFC5226"/>. The designated expert will
        verify that new type definitions do not duplicate existing
        type definitions (in name or functionality), prevent
        gratuitous additions to the namespace, and prevent any
        additions to the namespace that would impair the
        interoperability of CDNI implementations.  The designated expert
        will review the specification, even if it is a Standards Track RFC,
        to verify that it contains the following information:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>     The review will verify that the specification contains a
      reasonably defined purpose for the new payload type.  A
      reasonably defined purpose will relate to an existing or
      proposed CDNI interface and will not duplicate the functionality
      of any existing CDNI protocol feature without specifying a
      rational reason (e.g., updating an obsolete feature), a method for detecting and
          handling conflicts (e.g., a versioning system with
          prioritization matrix), and a suggested migration path
          (e.g., deprecation of the overlapped feature, or
          justification for co-existence).
</t>

          <t>The review will verify that the specification contains information as to which
          CDNI interface the new payload type pertains or affects.  The
          payload type may be applicable to multiple CDNI interfaces, but
          the justification for the new payload type will include a
          reasonable relationship to at least one Standards Track CDNI interface.</t>

          <t>The review will verify that the specification contains sufficient detail about
          the data encoding (e.g., JSON serialization for new CDNI
          metadata or capability advertisement objects, or ABNF and
          description for new CDNI logging file formats) to allow
          senders and receivers of the new payload type to implement
          compliant and interoperable payload parsers.</t>
        </list></t>

        <t>The registry contains the payload type and the
        specification describing the payload type.  The registry will
        initially be unpopulated.</t>
