                <t> This memo updates the registry of properties
                    in Authentication-Results: message header fields to
                    allow a multiple-result report to distinguish among
                    one or more cryptographic signatures on a message,
                    thus associating specific results with the signatures
                    they represent.  </t>

        <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
                <t> <xref target="AUTHRES"/> defined a new header field
                    for electronic mail messages that presents the results of
                    a message authentication effort in a machine-readable
                    format.  Absent from that specification was the means by
                    which the results of two cryptographic signatures,
                    such as those provided by <xref target="DKIM"/>,
                    can both have results reported in an unambiguous
                    manner. </t>

                <t> Fortunately, <xref target="AUTHRES"/> created IANA
                    registries of reporting properties, enabling an easy
                    remedy for this problem.  This memo thus registers
                    an additional reporting property allowing a result to
                    be associated with a specific digital signature. </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="keywords" title="Keywords">
                <t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
                    "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
                    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
                    interpreted as described in
                    <xref target="KEYWORDS"/>. </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="discussion" title="Discussion">
                <t> A message can contain multiple signatures of a common
                    sender authentication mechanism, such as

                    <xref target="DKIM"/>.

                    For example, a DomainKeys
                    Identified Mail (DKIM) signer could
                    apply signatures using two or more different message
                    canonicalization algorithms to determine the resistance of
                    each to being broken in transit.  </t>

                <t> By applying supported "ptype.property" combinations (cf.
                    the ABNF in <xref target="AUTHRES"/>), a result can be
                    associated with a given signature provided the signatures
                    are all unique within one of the registered values (e.g.,
                    all of them had unique "header.d" or "header.i" values).
                    This is not guaranteed, however; a single signing agent
                    might have practical reasons for affixing multiple
                    signatures with the same "d=" values while varying other
                    signature parameters.  This means one could get a
                    "dkim=pass" and "dkim=fail" result simultaneously on
                    verification, which is clearly ambiguous. </t>

                <t> It is thus necessary either to create or to identify a
                    signature attribute guaranteed to be unique, such that
                    it is possible to unambiguously associate a result with
                    the signature to which it refers. </t>

                <t> Collisions during general use of SHA1 and SHA256 are
                    uncommon (see <xref target="HASH-ATTACKS"/>), and RSA key
                    signing mechanisms are resilient to producing common
                    substrings.  Thus, the actual digital signature for a
                    cryptographic signing of the message is an ideal property
                    for such a unique identification.  It is not, however,
                    necessary to include the entire digital signature in an
                    <xref target="AUTHRES"/> header field just to identify
                    which result goes with which signature; since the
                    signatures
                    will almost always be substantially different, it is
                    anticipated that only the first several bytes of a
                    signature will be needed for disambiguating results. </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="definition" title="Definition">
                <t> This memo adds the "header.b" reporting item to the
                    IANA "Email Authentication Methods" registry created
                    upon publication of <xref target="AUTHRES"/>.
                    The value associated with this item in the header field
                    MUST be at least the first eight characters of the digital
                    signature (the "b=" tag from a DKIM-Signature)
                    for which a result is being relayed, and MUST
                    be long enough to be unique among the results being
                    reported.  Where the total length of the digital signature
                    is fewer than eight characters, the entire signature
                    MUST be included.  Matching of the value of this item
                    against the signature itself MUST be case-sensitive. </t>

                <t> If an evaluating agent observes that, despite the use
                    of this disambiguating tag, unequal authentication results
                    are offered about the same signature from the same
                    trusted authserv-id, that agent SHOULD ignore all such
                    results. </t>

                <t> <xref target="AUTHRES"/> discussed general security
                    considerations regarding the use of this header field.
                    The following new security considerations apply when
                    adding or processing this new ptype/property
                    combination: </t>

                <section anchor="actually_better" title="Improvement">
                        <t> Rather than introducing a new security issue,
                            this can be seen to fix a security weakness of
                            the original specification: Useful
                            information can now be obtained from results that
                            could previously have been ambiguous and thus
                            obscured or, worse, misinterpreted. </t>
                </section>

                <section anchor="forgeries" title="Result Forgeries">
                        <t> An attacker could copy a valid signature and 
                            add it to a message in transit, modifying some
                            portion of it.  This could cause two results to
                            be provided for the same "header.b" value even
                            if the entire "b=" string is used in an attempt
                            to differentiate the results.  This attack could
                            cause an ambiguous result to be relayed and
                            possibly neutralize any benefit given to a "pass"
                            result that would have otherwise occurred, possibly
                            impacting the delivery of valid messages. </t>

                        <t> It is worth noting, however, that a false
                            negative ("fail") can be generated in this way,
                            but it is extremely difficult to create a false
                            positive ("pass") through such an attack.  Thus,
                            a cautious implementation could discard the
                            false negative in that instance. </t>

                <section anchor="short_macs"
                         title="New Schemes with Small Signatures">
                        <t> Should a new signing scheme be introduced
                            with a signature whose length is less than eight
                            characters, <xref target="definition"/> specifies
                            that the entire signature must be used.  The
                            obvious concern in such a case would be that the
                            signature scheme is itself prone to collisions,
                            making the value reported by this field not
                            useful.  In such cases, the risk is created by
                            the likelihood of collisions and not by this
                            mechanism; furthermore, <xref target="definition"/>
                            recommends the results be ignored if that were to
                            occur, preventing the application of an ambiguous
                            result. </t>

                                        <t> DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)
                                            defines a domain-level
                                            authentication framework for email
                                            using public-key cryptography and
                                            key server technology to permit
                                            verification of the source and
                                            contents of messages by either
                                            Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) or
                                            Mail User Agents (MUAs).  The
                                            ultimate goal of this framework is
                                            to permit a signing domain to
                                            assert responsibility for a
                                            message, thus protecting message
                                            signer identity and the integrity
                                            of the messages they convey while
                                            retaining the functionality of
                                            Internet email as it is known
                                            today.  Protection of email
                                            identity may assist in the global
                                            control of "spam" and "phishing".

                                            several words are used to signify

                                            have caused some people to question
                                            whether common Internet protocols
                                            need to be changed, and if so, how.

                                        <t> Many protocols make use of
                                            identifiers consisting of
                                            constants and other well-known
                                            values. Even after a protocol has
                                            been defined and deployment has
                                            begun, new values may need to be
                                            assigned (e.g., for a new option
                                            type in DHCP, or a new encryption
                                            or authentication transform for
                                            IPsec). To ensure that such
                                            quantities have consistent values
                                            and interpretations across all
                                            implementations, their assignment
                                            must be administered by a central
                                            authority. For IETF protocols,
                                            that role is provided by the
                                            Internet Assigned Numbers
                                            Authority (IANA). </t>

                                        <t> In order for IANA to manage a
                                            given namespace prudently, it
                                            needs guidelines describing the
                                            conditions under which new
                                            values can be assigned or when
                                            modifications to existing values
                                            can be made.  If IANA is expected
                                            to play a role in the management
                                            of a namespace, IANA must be given

                                <postamble> Example 1: Header field
                                            reporting results from 
                                            multiple signatures added
                                            at initial signing </postamble>

<t>
   Here we see an example of a message that was signed twice by the
   author's ADministrative Management Domain (ADMD).  One signature used
   "relaxed" header canonicalization, and the other used "simple" header
   canonicalization; both used "simple" body canonicalization.
</t>

<t>
   Presumably due to a change in one of the five header fields covered
   by the two signatures, the former signature passed, while
   the latter signature failed to verify.  In particular, the "relaxed" header
   canonicalization of [DKIM] is resilient to changes in whitespace in
   the header, while "simple" is not, and the latter is the one that
   failed in this example. </t>

                        <t> The item registered by this memo allows an
                            evaluation module to determine which DKIM result
                            goes with which signature.  Without the
                            "header.b" portion of the result, it is unclear
                            which one passed and which one failed. </t>
