 <t>
      This memo serves to register and document the <spanx
      style="verb">font</spanx> top-level media type,
      under which subtypes for representation formats for fonts may be registered. This
      document also serves as a registration application for a set of intended subtypes,
      which are representative of some existing subtypes already in use, and currently registered 
      under the "application" tree by their separate registrations.

<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
    <t>
      The process of setting type in computer systems and other forms of text presentation
      systems uses fonts in order to provide visual representations of the glyphs. Just as
      with images, for example, there are a number of ways to represent the visual information
      of the glyphs. Early font formats often used bitmaps, as these could have been carefully
      tuned for maximum readability at a given size on low-resolution displays. More recently,
      scalable vector outline fonts have come into widespread use. In these fonts, the
      outlines of the glyphs are described, and the presentation system renders the outline in
      the desired position and size.</t>
    <t>
    Over time, a number of standard formats for recording font
    descriptions have evolved.  

    Internet Media Types <xref target="RFC6838"/> are used to label content carried over Internet protocols.

      This document defines a new top-level type "font" according to Section 4.2.7
	  of <xref target="RFC6838"/>. This top-level type indicates that the content specifies
	  font data. Under this top-level type, different representation formats of fonts may be
	  registered.</t>
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
</section>
<section title="Background and Justification">
    <t>Historically, there has not been a registration of formats for fonts. More recently, there
      have been several representation formats registered as media subtypes under the "application"
      top-level type (for example, "application/font-woff").  
      However, with the rapid adoption of web fonts (based on the data
      from HTTP Archive <xref target="HTTP-Archive-Trends"/>
      showing a huge increase in web font usage from 1% in the end of 2010
      to 50% across all sites in the beginning of 2015), custom fonts on the web have become
      a core web resource. As the in-depth analysis <xref target="Font-Media-Type-Analysis"/> shows,
      the lack of
      the intuitive top-level font type is causing significant confusion among developers -- while
      currently defined font subtypes are severely under-utilized, there are many more sites that
      already use nonexistent (but highly intuitive) media types such as "font/woff", "font/ttf", and
      "font/truetype". At the same time, the majority of sites resort to using generic types such as
      "application/octet-stream", "text/plain", and "text/html", or use unregisterable types
      such as "application/x-font-ttf".</t>

    <t>Contrary to the expectations of the W3C WebFonts WG, which
    developed Web Open Font Format (WOFF), 
      the officially defined media types such as "application/font-woff"
      and "application/font-sfnt" see a very limited use -- their adoption rates trail far behind as the
      actual use of web fonts continues to increase. The members of the W3C
      WebFonts WG concluded that
      the use of the "application" top-level type is not ideal. First, the "application" sub-tree is treated
      (correctly) with great caution with respect to viruses and other active code. Secondly, the lack
      of a top-level type means that there is no opportunity to have a common set of optional parameters,
      such as are specified here. Third, fonts have a unique set of licensing and usage restrictions,
      which makes it worthwhile to identify this general category with a unique top-level type.</t>

    <t>The W3C WebFonts WG decided <xref target="WG-tlt"/> that the situation can be significantly improved if a set of font
      media types is registered using "font" as a dedicated top-level type. Based on the data analysis
      presented above, we conclude that it is the presence of simple and highly intuitive media types
      for images that caused their widespread adoption, where the correct
      usage of existing media types reaches over 97% for all subtypes in the
      "image" tree. The WG
      considers that, keeping in mind a rapid adoption of fonts on the web, the registration of the top-level
      media type for fonts along with the intuitive set of subtypes that reflect popular and widely used
      data formats would further stimulate the adoption of web fonts, significantly simplify web server
      configuration process, and facilitate the proper use of media types for fonts.</t>
</section>
<section anchor="sec" title="Security Considerations">
    <t>Fonts are interpreted data structures that represent collections of different tables containing
      data that represent different types of information, including glyph outlines in various formats,
      hinting instructions, metrics and layout information for multiple languages and writing systems,
      rules for glyph substitution and positioning, etc. 
      
      In particular, the hinting instructions for TrueType glyphs represent executable code that has 
      the potential to be maliciously constructed (for example, intended to hang the interpreter).
      
      There are many existing, already standardized font table tags
      and formats that allow an unspecified number of entries containing predefined data fields for
      storage of variable-length binary data. Many existing font formats (TrueType 
      <xref target="truetype-wiki"/>, OpenType
       and OFF <xref target="opentype-wiki"/>, SIL Graphite,
      WOFF, etc.) are based on the table-based SFNT (scalable font) format, which is extremely
      flexible, highly extensible, and offers an opportunity to introduce additional table structures when
      needed, in an upward-compatible way that would not affect existing font rendering engines and text layout implementations.
      However, this very extensibility may present specific security concerns -- the flexibility and ease
      of adding new data structures makes it easy for any arbitrary data to be hidden inside a font file.
      There is a significant risk that the flexibility of font data structures may be exploited to hide
      malicious binary content disguised as a font data component.</t>

    <t>Fonts may contain 'hints', which are programmatic instructions that are executed by the font engine
      for the alignment of graphical elements of glyph outlines with the target display pixel grid.
      Depending on the font technology utilized in the creation of a font, these hints may represent active
      code interpreted and executed by the font rasterizer. Even though hints operate within the confines
      of the glyph outline conversion system and have no access outside the font rendering engine, hint
      instructions can be quite complex, and a maliciously designed complex font could cause
      undue resource consumption (e.g., memory or CPU cycles) on a machine interpreting it. Indeed, fonts
      are sufficiently complex that most (if not all) interpreters cannot be completely protected from
      malicious fonts without undue performance penalties.</t>

    <t>Widespread use of fonts as necessary components of visual content presentation warrants that
      careful attention should be given to security considerations whenever a font is either embedded
      into an electronic document or transmitted alongside media content as a linked resource. While
      many existing font formats provide certain levels of protection of data integrity (such mechanisms
      include, e.g., checksums and digital signatures), font data formats provide neither privacy nor
      confidentiality protection internally; if needed, such protection should be provided externally.</t>
  </section>
  <section title="IANA Considerations ">
  <t>This specification registers a new top-level type, "font", in the
   standards tree, adds it as an alternative value of "Type Name" in the
   media types registration form  <xref target="Media-Type-Registration"/>,
   and registers several subtypes for it.
  </t>

<section title="Definition and Encoding">
    <t>The "font" as the primary media content type indicates that the content
    identified by it requires a
      certain graphic subsystem such as a font rendering engine (and, in some
      cases, a text layout and a shaping
      engine) to process it as font data, which in turn may require a certain level of hardware capabilities such
      as certain levels of CPU performance and available memory. The "font" media type does not provide
      any specific information about the underlying data format and how the font information should be
      interpreted -- the subtypes defined within a "font" tree name the specific font formats.
      Unrecognized subtypes of "font" should be treated as "application/octet-stream". Implementations
      may pass unrecognized subtypes to a common font-handling system, if such a system is available.</t>
  </section>

  <section title="Fragment Identifiers for Font Collections" anchor="fragments">
    <t>Fragment identifiers for font collections identify one font in the collection by 
    the PostScript name (name ID=6) <xref target="ISO.14496-22.2015"/>. This is a string, 
    no longer than 63 characters and restricted to the 
    printable ASCII subset, codes 33 ? 126, except for the 10 characters 
    '[', ']', '(', ')', '{', '}', '&lt;', '&gt;', '/', '%', which are forbidden
    by <xref target="ISO.14496-22.2015"/>. </t>
    <t>In addition, the following 6 characters could occur in the PostScript name but are 
    forbidden in fragments by <xref target="RFC3986"/>,
    and thus must be escaped:  '"', '#', '\', '^', '`', '|'.</t>
    <t>If (following un-escaping) this string matches one of the PostScript
    names in the name table, that font is selected. For example, <spanx style="verb">#Foo-Bold</spanx> 
    refers to the font with PostScript name <spanx style="verb">Foo-Bold</spanx>
    and <spanx style="verb">#Caret%5Estick</spanx> refers to the font with PostScript 
    name <spanx style="verb">Caret^stick</spanx>.
    If the name does not match, or if a fragment is not specified, the first font
    in the collection is matched. Note that the order of fonts in collections may change
    as the font is revised, so relying on a particular font in a collection always being first is unwise.</t>
  </section>

  <section title="Registration Procedure">
    <t>New font formats should be registered using the online form <xref
    target="Media-Type-Registration"/>. <xref target="RFC6838"/> should be consulted on registration procedures. In particular,
    the font specification should preferably be freely available. If the font format can contain
    multiple fonts, a fragment identifier syntax should also be defined.</t>
    <t>Note that new parameter sub-values may be defined in the future.  If an
      implementation does not recognize a sub-value in the
      comma-separated list, it should ignore the sub-value and continue
      processing the other sub-values in the list.</t>
   </section>

<section title="Subtype Registrations">
    <t>In this section, the initial entries under the top-level 'font' media type are specified. They also
      serve as examples for future registrations.</t>
    <t>For each subtype, an @font-face format identifier is listed. This is for use with the @font-face
    src descriptor, defined by the Cascading Style Sheets Level 3 (CSS3) Fonts specification <xref target="W3C.CR-css-fonts-3-20131003"/>.
    That specification is normative; the identifiers here are informative.</t>

    representations, e.g., both TrueType and PostScript (CFF) outlines. 
    Existing font rendering engines may not be able
      to process some of the particular outline formats, and downloading a font resource that contains
      only unsupported glyph data format would be futile.
      Therefore, it is useful to clearly identify the format of the glyph outline data
      within a font using an optional parameter, and allow applications to make decisions about
      downloading a particular font resource sooner. Similarly, another optional parameter
      identifies the type of text shaping and layout mechanism that is provided by a font. </t>

		<abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the WOFF font packaging format. This format was designed to provide
      lightweight, easy-to-implement compression of font data, suitable for use with CSS @font-face rules.
      Any properly licensed TrueType/OpenType/Open Font Format file can be packaged in WOFF format for Web
      use. User agents decode the WOFF file to restore the font data such that it will display identically
      to the input font.</t>
      <t>The WOFF format also allows additional metadata to be attached to the file; this can be used
        by font designers or vendors to include licensing or other information, beyond that present in the
        original font. Such metadata does not affect the rendering of the font in any way, but may be displayed
        to the user on request.</t>
      <t>The WOFF format is not intended to replace other formats such as TrueType/OpenType/Open Font Format
        or SVG fonts, but provides an alternative solution for use cases where these formats may be less
        optimal, or where licensing considerations make their use less acceptable.</t>

		<abstract><t>Based on experience with WOFF 1.0, which is widely deployed, this specification was
      developed to provide improved compression and thus lower use of network bandwidth, while still
      allowing fast decompression even on mobile devices. This is achieved by combining a content-aware
      preprocessing step and improved entropy coding, compared to the Flate compression used in
      WOFF 1.0.</t>
