<section title="Introduction">

<t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261"/> is
the subject of numerous specifications that have been produced by the
IETF. It can be difficult to locate the right document, or even to
determine the set of Request for Comments (RFC) about SIP. "Don't
Panic!" <xref target="HGTTG"/> This specification serves as a guide to
the SIP RFC series. It is a current snapshot of the specifications
under the SIP umbrella at the time of publication. It is anticipated
that this document itself will be regularly updated as SIP
specifications mature. Furthermore, it references many specifications,
which, at the time of publication of this document, were not yet
finalized, and may eventually be completed or abandoned. Therefore,
the enumeration of specifications here is a work-in-progress and
subject to change.
</t>


<t>
For each specification, a paragraph or so description is
included that summarizes the purpose of the specification. Each
specification also includes a letter that designates its category in
the Standards Track <xref target="RFC2026"/>. These values are: </t>

<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="S:">Standards Track (Proposed Standard, Draft Standard, or
Standard)</t>

<t hangText="E:">Experimental</t>

<t hangText="B:">Best Current Practice</t>

<t hangText="I:">Informational</t>

</list>

<t>
The specifications are grouped together by topic. The topics are:
<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="Core:"> The SIP specifications that are expected to be
      utilized for a wide variety of sessions or registrations.
</t>

<t hangText="Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) Interop:">
  Specifications related to interworking
  with the telephone network.
</t>

<t hangText="General Purpose Infrastructure:"> General purpose
  extensions to SIP, SDP (Session Description Protocol), and MIME, but
  ones that are not expected to always be used.
</t>

<t hangText="NAT Traversal:"> Specifications to deal with firewall and
  NAT traversal.
</t>

<t hangText="Call Control Primitives:"> Specifications for
  manipulating SIP dialogs and calls.
</t>

<t hangText="Event Framework:"> Definitions of the core specifications for
  the SIP event framework, providing for pub/sub capability.
</t>

<t hangText="Event Packages:"> Packages that utilize the SIP event
  framework. 
</t>

<t hangText="Quality of Service:"> Specifications related to
  multimedia quality of service (QoS).
</t>

<t hangText="Operations and Management:"> Specifications related to
  configuration and monitoring of SIP deployments.
</t>

<t hangText="SIP Compression:"> Specifications to facilitate usage of
  SIP with the Signaling Compression (Sigcomp) framework.
</t>

<t hangText="SIP Service URIs:"> Specifications on how to use SIP URIs
  to address multimedia services.

  problem space or provide an optimization.
</t>


<t hangText="Security Mechanisms:"> Specifications providing security
  functionality for SIP.
</t>

<t hangText="Conferencing:"> Specifications for multimedia
  conferencing. 
</t>



<t hangText="Instant Messaging, Presence, and Multimedia:"> SIP
  extensions related to IM, presence, and multimedia. This covers only
  the SIP extensions related to these topics. See
  <xref target="SIMPLE"/> for a full treatment of SIP
  for IM and Presence (SIMPLE).
</t>

<t hangText="Emergency Services:"> SIP extensions related to emergency
  services. See <xref target="ECRIT-FRAME"/> for a more
  complete treatment of additional functionality related to emergency
  services.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>Typically, SIP
extensions fit naturally into topic areas, and implementors
interested in a particular topic often implement many or all of the
specifications in that area. There are some specifications that fall
into multiple topic areas, in which case they are listed more than
once. 
</t>

<t>Do not print all the specs cited here at once, as they
might share the fate of the rules of Brockian Ultracricket
when bound together: collapse under their own gravity and
form a black hole <xref target="HGTTG"/>.
</t>

<t>
This document itself is not an update to RFC 3261 or an extension to
SIP. It is an informational document, meant to guide newcomers,
implementors, and deployers to the many specifications
associated with SIP.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Scope of This Document">

<t>
It is very difficult to enumerate the set of SIP specifications. This
is because there are many protocols that are intimately related to
SIP and used by nearly all SIP implementations, but are not formally
SIP extensions. As such, this document formally defines a "SIP
specification" as:
</t>

<list style="symbols">

<t>RFC 3261 and any specification that defines an extension to it,
where an extension is a mechanism that changes or updates in
some way a behavior specified there.
</t>

<t>The basic SDP specification <xref target="RFC4566"/> and
any specification that defines an extension to SDP whose primary
purpose is to support SIP.
</t>

<t>Any specification that defines a MIME object whose primary purpose
is to support SIP. 
</t>

</list>

<t>
Excluded from this list are requirements, architectures, registry
definitions, non-normative frameworks, and processes. Best Current
Practices are included when they normatively define mechanisms for
accomplishing a task, or provide significant description of the
usage of the normative specifications, such as call flows.
</t>

<t> The SIP change process <xref target="RFC3427"/> defines two types
of extensions to SIP: normal extensions and the so-called
P-headers (where P stands for "preliminary", "private", or
"proprietary", and the "P-" prefix is included in the header field
name), which are meant to be used in areas of limited applicability.
P-headers cannot be defined in the Standards Track. For the most part,
P-headers are not included in the listing here, with the exception of
those that have seen general usage despite their P-header status.
</t>

<t>
This document includes specifications, which have already
been approved by the IETF and granted an RFC number, in addition
to Internet Drafts, which are still under development within the IETF and
will eventually finish and get an RFC number. Inclusion of Internet
Drafts here helps encourage early implementation and demonstrations of
interoperability of the protocol, and thus aids in the
standards-setting process. Inclusion of these also identifes where the IETF is
targetting a solution at a particular problem space. Note that final
IANA assignment of codepoints (such as option tags and header field
names) does not take place until shortly before
publication as an RFC, and thus codepoint assignments may change. 
</t>

</section>

<section title="Core SIP Specifications">

<t>
The core SIP specifications represent the set of specifications whose
functionality is broadly applicable. An extension is broadly
applicable if it fits into one of the following categories:
</t>

<list style="symbols">

<t>For specifications that impact SIP session management, the
extension would be used for almost every session initiated by a user
agent.
</t>

<t>For specifications that impact SIP registrations, the extension
would be used for almost every registration initiated by a user agent.
</t>

<t>For specifications that impact SIP subscriptions, the extension
would be used for almost every subscription initiated by a user agent.
</t>

</list>

<t>In other words, these are not specifications that are used just for
some requests and not others; they are specifications that would
apply to each and every request for which the extension is
relevant. In the galaxy of SIP, these specifications are like towels
<xref target="HGTTG"/>.
</t>

<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="RFC 3261, The Session Initiation Protocol (S):">
<xref target="RFC3261"/> is the core SIP protocol
itself. RFC 3261 obsoletes <xref target="RFC2543"/>. It is the
president of the galaxy <xref 
target="HGTTG"/> as
far as the suite of SIP specifications is concerned. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3263, Locating SIP Servers (S):"><xref
target="RFC3263"/> provides DNS procedures for taking a SIP URI and
determining a SIP server that is associated with that SIP URI. RFC
3263 is essential for any implementation using SIP with DNS. RFC 3263
makes use of both DNS SRV records <xref target="RFC2782"/> and NAPTR
records <xref target="RFC3401"/>.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3264, An Offer/Answer Model with the Session
Description Protocol (S):"> <xref target="RFC3264"/>
defines how the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref
target="RFC4566"/> is used with SIP to negotiate the
parameters of a media session. It is in widespread usage and an
integral part of the behavior of RFC 3261.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3265, SIP-Specific Event Notification (S):"> <xref
target="RFC3265"/>
defines the SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY methods. These two methods provide a
general event notification framework for SIP. To actually use the
framework, extensions need to be defined for specific event
packages. An event package defines a schema for the event data and
describes other aspects of event processing specific to that
schema. An RFC 3265 implementation is required when any event package
is used.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3325, Private Extensions to SIP for Asserted Identity
within Trusted Networks (I):"> Though its P-header status implies that
it has limited applicability, <xref target="RFC3325"/>, which
defines the P-Asserted-Identity header field, has been widely deployed. It is
used as the basic mechanism for providing network-asserted caller ID
services. Its intended update, <xref target="UPDATE-PAI"/>,
clarifies its usage for connected party identification as well. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3327, SIP Extension Header Field for Registering
Non-Adjacent Contacts (S):"> <xref target="RFC3327"/> defines
the Path header field. This field is inserted by proxies between a
client and their registrar. It allows inbound requests towards that
client to traverse these proxies prior to being delivered to the user
agent. It is essential in any SIP deployment that has edge proxies,
which are proxies between the client and the home proxy or SIP
registrar. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3581, An Extension to SIP for Symmetric Response
Routing (S):"> <xref target="RFC3581"/> defines the rport
parameter of the Via header. It allows SIP responses to traverse
  NAT. It is one of several specifications that are utilized for NAT
  traversal (see <xref target="sec-nat"/>).
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3840, Indicating User Agent Capabilities in SIP (S):">
<xref target="RFC3840"/> defines a mechanism for
carrying capability information about 
a user agent in REGISTER requests and in dialog-forming requests like
INVITE. It has found use with conferencing (the isfocus parameter
declares that a user agent is a conference server) and with
applications like push-to-talk.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 4320, Actions Addressing Issues Identified with the
Non-INVITE Transaction in SIP (S):"> <xref target="RFC4320"/>
formally updates RFC 3261 and modifies some of the behaviors
associated with non-INVITE transactions. This addresses some problems
found in timeout and failure cases.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 4474, Enhancements for Authenticated Identity
Management in SIP (S):"> <xref
target="RFC4474"/> defines a mechanism for providing a
cryptographically verifiable identity of the calling party in a SIP
request. Known as "SIP Identity", this mechanism provides an
alternative to RFC 3325. It has seen little deployment so far, but its
importance as a key construct for anti-spam techniques
and new security mechanisms makes it a core part of the SIP specifications.
</t>

<t hangText="GRUU, Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User
Agent Identifiers (GRUU) in SIP (S):"> <xref
target="GRUU"/> defines a mechanism for directing
requests towards a specific UA instance. GRUU is essential for
features like transfer and provides another piece of the SIP NAT
traversal story.
</t>

<t hangText="OUTBOUND, Managing Client Initiated
	     Connections through SIP (S):">
	     <xref target="OUTBOUND"/>, also known 
as SIP outbound, defines important changes to the SIP registration
mechanism that enable delivery of SIP messages towards a UA when it
is behind a NAT. This specification is the cornerstone of the SIP NAT
traversal strategy.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 4566, Session Description Protocol (S):"> <xref
target="RFC4566"/> defines a format for
representing multimedia sessions. SDP objects are carried in the body
of SIP messages and, based on the offer/answer model, are used to
negotiate the media characteristics of a session between users.
</t>

<t hangText="SDP-CAP, SDP
	     Capability Negotiation (S):"> <xref 
target="SDP-CAP"/>
defines a set of extensions to SDP that allows for capability
negotiation within SDP. Capability negotiation can be used to select
between different profiles of RTP (secure vs. unsecure) or to
negotiate codecs such that an agent has to select one amongst a set of
supported codecs.
</t>


<t hangText="ICE, Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
(S):"> <xref target="ICE"/> defines a
technique for NAT traversal of media sessions for protocols that make
use of the offer/answer model. This specification is the
  IETF-recommended mechanism for NAT traversal for SIP media streams, and is
meant to be used even by endpoints that are themselves never behind a
NAT. A SIP option tag and media feature tag <xref
target="OPTION-TAG"/> (also a core specification)
  have been defined for use with ICE. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3605, Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) Attribute in
the Session Description Protocol (SDP) (S):"> <xref
target="RFC3605"/> defines a way to explicitly signal,
within an SDP message, the IP address and port for RTCP, rather than
using the port+1 rule in the Real Time Transport Protocol (RTP) <xref
target="RFC3550"/>. It is needed for devices behind NAT, and the specification is required by ICE.

</t>

<t hangText="RFC 4916, Connected Identity in the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) (S):"> <xref
target="RFC4916"/> formally updates RFC 3261. It defines an
extension to SIP that allows a calling user to determine the identity of the
final called user (connected party). Due to forwarding and retargeting services, this may not be the
same as the user that the caller was originally trying to reach. The
mechanism works in tandem with the SIP identity specification <xref
target="RFC4474"/> to provide signatures over the
connected party identity. It can also be used
if a party identity changes mid-call due to third-party call control
actions or PSTN behavior.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3311, The SIP UPDATE Method (S):"> <xref
target="RFC3311"/> defines the UPDATE method for SIP. This method is
meant as a means for updating session information prior to the
completion of the initial INVITE transaction. It can also be used to
  update other information, such as the identity of the participant
  <xref target="RFC4916"/>,
  without involving an updated offer/answer exchange. It was developed
initially to support <xref target="RFC3312"/>, but has found
  other uses. In particular, its usage with RFC 4916 means it will
  typically be used as part of every session, to convey a secure,
  connected identity. 
</t>

<t hangText="SIPS-URI, The Use of the SIPS URI Scheme in the Session
	     Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	     (S):"> <xref target="SIPS-URI"/>
	     is intended to update RFC 3261. It revises the processing of
	     the SIPS URI, originally 
	     defined in RFC 3261, to fix many errors and problems
	     that have been encountered with that mechanism. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3665, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Basic Call
	     Flow Examples (B):"> <xref target="RFC3665"/> contains
	     best-practice call flow examples for basic SIP
	     interactions -- call establishment, termination, and
	     registration.
</t>


<t hangText="Essential Corrections to SIP:"> A collection of fixes to
SIP that address important bugs and vulnerabilities. These include a
  fix requiring loop detection in any  proxy that
  forks <xref target="LOOP-FIX"/>, a
  clarification on how record-routing works
  <xref target="RECORD-ROUTE"/>, and a correction to
  the IPv6 BNF <xref target="ABNF-FIX"/>. 
</t>

</list>

</section>

<section title="Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)
Interworking">

<t>
Numerous extensions and usages of SIP are related to interoperability and
communications with or through the PSTN. 
</t>

<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="RFC 2848, The PINT Service Protocol (S):"> <xref
target="RFC2848"/> is one of
the earliest extensions to SIP. It defines procedures for using SIP to
invoke services that actually execute on the PSTN. Its main
application is for third-party call control, allowing an IP host to
set up a call between two PSTN endpoints. PINT (PSTN/Internet
  Interworking) has a relatively narrow
focus and has not seen widespread deployment.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3910, The SPIRITS Protocol (S):"> Continuing the trend
of naming PSTN-related extensions with alcohol references, SPIRITS
  (Services in PSTN Requesting Internet Services)
<xref target="RFC3910"/> defines the inverse of PINT. It allows a
switch in the PSTN to ask an IP element how to proceed with call
waiting. It was developed primarily to support Internet Call Waiting
(ICW). Perhaps the next specification will be called the Pan Galactic
Gargle Blaster <xref target="HGTTG"/>.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3372, SIP for Telephones (SIP-T): Context and
Architectures (I):"> SIP-T <xref target="RFC3372"/> defines a mechanism
for using SIP between pairs of PSTN gateways. Its essential idea is to
tunnel ISDN User Part (ISUP) signaling between the gateways in the body of SIP
messages. SIP-T motivated the development of INFO <xref
target="RFC2976"/>. SIP-T has seen widespread implementation for the
  limited deployment model that it addresses. As ISUP endpoints
  disappear from the network, the need for this mechanism will
  decrease. </t>

<t hangText="RFC 3398, ISUP to SIP Mapping (S):"> <xref
target="RFC3398"/> defines how to do protocol mapping from the SS7
ISDN User Part (ISUP) signaling to SIP. It is widely used in SS7 to
SIP gateways and is part of the SIP-T framework.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 4497, Interworking between the Session Initiation
	     Protocol (SIP) and QSIG (B):"> <xref target="RFC4497"/>
	     defines how to do protocol mapping from Q.SIG, used for
	     Private Branch Exchange (PBX) signaling, to SIP. </t>

<t hangText="RFC 3578, Mapping of ISUP Overlap Signaling to SIP (S):">
  <xref target="RFC3578"/> defines a mechanism to map overlap 
dialing into SIP. This specification is widely regarded as the ugliest
SIP specification, as the introduction to the specification itself
advises that it has many problems. Overlap signaling (the practice of
sending digits into the network as dialed instead of waiting for
complete collection of the called party number) is largely
incompatible with SIP at some fairly fundamental levels. That said,
RFC 3578 is mostly harmless and has seen some usage.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3960, Early Media and Ringtone Generation in SIP
(I):"> <xref target="RFC3960"/> defines some guidelines for handling
early media -- the practice of sending media from the called party or
an application server towards the caller prior to acceptance of the
call. Early media is often generated from the PSTN. Early media is
a complex topic, and this specification does not fully address the
problems associated with it.  </t>

<t hangText="RFC 3959, Early Session Disposition Type for the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) (S):"> <xref target="RFC3959"/> defines a
  new session disposition type for use with early 
media. It indicates that the SDP in the body is for a special early
media session. This has seen little usage.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3204, MIME Media Types for ISUP and QSIG Objects
(S):"> <xref target="RFC3204"/> defines MIME objects for representing
SS7 and QSIG signaling messages. SS7 signaling messages are carried in
the body of SIP messages when SIP-T is used. QSIG signaling messages
can be carried in a similar way.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC3 666, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Public
	     Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) Call Flows (B):">
	     <xref target="RFC3666"/> provides best practice call
	     flows around interworking with the PSTN. 
</t>

</list>

</section>

<section title="General Purpose Infrastructure Extensions">

<t>
These extensions are general purpose enhancements to SIP, SDP, and MIME that can
serve a wide variety of uses. However, they are not used for every
session or registration, as the core specifications are. 
</t>

<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="RFC 3262, Reliability of Provisional Responses in SIP (S):">
SIP defines two types of responses to a request: final and
provisional. Provisional responses are numbered from 100 to 199. In
SIP, these responses are not sent reliably. This choice was made in
RFC 2543 since the messages were meant to just be truly informational
and rendered to the user. However, subsequent work on PSTN
interworking demonstrated a need to map provisional responses to PSTN
messages that needed to be sent reliably. <xref
target="RFC3262"/> was developed to allow reliability of provisional
responses. The specification defines the PRACK method, used for indicating that
a provisional response was received. Though it provides a generic
capability for SIP, RFC 3262 implementations have been most common in
PSTN interworking devices. However, PRACK brings a great deal of
complication for relatively small benefit. As such, it has seen only
moderate levels of deployment.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3323, A Privacy Mechanism for the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) (S):"> <xref target="RFC3323"/> defines the
Privacy header field, used by clients to request anonymity for their
requests. Though it defines several privacy services, the only one
broadly used is the one that supports privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity
header field <xref target="RFC3325"/>.
</t>

<t hangText="UA-PRIVACY, UA-Driven Privacy Mechanism
	     for SIP (S):"> <xref target="UA-PRIVACY"/>
	     defines a mechanism for achieving 
	     anonymous calls in SIP. It is an alternative to
	     <xref target="RFC3323"/>, and instead places more
	     intelligence in the endpoint to craft anonymous messages
	     by directly accessing network services. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 2976, The INFO Method (S):"> <xref
target="RFC2976"/> was defined as an extension to RFC 2543. It defines
a method, INFO, used to transport mid-dialog information that has no
impact on SIP itself. Its driving application was the transport of
PSTN-related information when using SIP between a pair of
gateways. Though originally conceived for broader use, it only found
standardized usage with SIP-T <xref target="RFC3372"/>. It has been
used to support numerous proprietary and non-interoperable
extensions due to its poorly defined scope.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3326, The Reason Header Field for SIP (S):">
  <xref target="RFC3326"/> defines the Reason header field. It is used 
in requests, such as BYE, to indicate the reason that the request is
being sent.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3388, Grouping of Media Lines in the Session
Description Protocol (S):"> <xref target="RFC3388">RFC 3388</xref>
defines a framework for grouping together media streams in an SDP
message. Such a grouping allows relationships between these streams,
such as which stream is the audio for a particular video feed, to be
expressed. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3420, Internet Media Type message/sipfrag (S):">
<xref target="RFC3420"/> defines a MIME object that
contains a SIP message fragment. Only certain header fields and parts
of the SIP message are present. For example, it is used to
report back on the responses received to a request sent as a
consequence of a REFER. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3608, SIP Extension Header Field for Service Route
Discovery During Registration (S):"> <xref target="RFC3608"/>
allows a client to determine, from a REGISTER response, a path of
proxies to use in requests it sends outside of a dialog. It can also
be used by proxies to verify the Route header in client-initiated
requests. In many respects, it is the inverse of the Path header
field, but has seen less usage since default outbound proxies have
been sufficient in many deployments.  </t>


<t hangText="RFC 3841, Caller Preferences for SIP (S):"> <xref
target="RFC3841"/> defines a set of headers that a client can include
in a request to control the way in which the request is routed
downstream. It allows a client to direct a request towards a UA with
specific capabilities, which a UA indicates using
  <xref target="RFC3840"/>.  </t>

<t hangText="RFC 4028, Session Timers in SIP (S):"> <xref
target="RFC4028"/> defines a keepalive mechanism for SIP signaling. It
is primarily meant to provide a way to clean up old state in proxies
that are holding call state for calls from failed endpoints that were
never terminated normally. Despite its name, the session timer is not
a mechanism for detecting a network failure mid-call. Session timers
introduce a fair bit of complexity for relatively little gain, and
have seen moderate deployment. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 4168, SCTP as a Transport for SIP (S):"> <xref
target="RFC4168"/> defines how to carry SIP messages over the Stream
Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) <xref target="RFC4960"/>. SCTP
  has seen very limited usage for SIP transport.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 4244, An Extension to SIP for Request History
Information (S):"> <xref target="RFC4244"/> defines the History-Info
header field, which 
indicates information on how and why a call came to be routed to
a particular destination. 
</t> 

<t hangText="RFC 4145, TCP-Based Media Transport in the Session
Description Protocol (SDP) (S):"> <xref target="RFC4145"/> defines an
  extension to SDP for setting up TCP-based 
sessions between user agents. It defines who sets up the connection
and how its lifecycle is managed. It has seen relatively little usage
due to the small number of media types to date that use TCP.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 4091, The Alternative Network Address Types (ANAT) Semantics

<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="ICE, Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
(S):"> <xref target="ICE"/> defines a
technique for NAT traversal of media sessions for protocols that make
use of the offer/answer model. This specification is the
  IETF-recommended mechanism for NAT traversal for SIP media streams, and is
meant to be used even by endpoints that are themselves never behind a
NAT. A SIP option tag and media feature tag <xref

ICE. 
</t>

<t hangText="ICE-TCP, TCP Candidates with Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) (S):"> <xref target="ICE-TCP"/>

</t>

<t hangText="OUTBOUND, Managing Client Initiated Connections through SIP (S):"> <xref target="OUTBOUND"/>, also known
as SIP outbound, defines important changes to the SIP registration
mechanism that enable delivery of SIP messages towards a UA when it
is behind a NAT. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3581, An Extension to SIP for Symmetric Response

<section title="Call Control Primitives">

<t>
Numerous SIP extensions provide a toolkit of dialog- and
call-management techniques. These techniques have been combined together to
build many SIP-based services.
</t>

<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="RFC 3515, The REFER Method (S):">REFER
<xref target="RFC3515"/> defines a mechanism for asking a user agent
to send a SIP request. It's a form of SIP remote control, and is the
primary tool used for call transfer in SIP. Beware that not all
potential uses of REFER (neither for all methods nor for all URI
schemes) are well defined.  Implementors should only use the well-defined
ones, and should not second guess or freely assume behavior for the others
to avoid unexpected behavior of remote UAs, interoperability issues,
and other bad surprises.

INVITE, it causes the recipient to join the resulting dialog into a
conference with another dialog in progress. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3891, The SIP Replaces Header (S):"> <xref

<section title="Event Framework">

<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="RFC 3265, SIP-Specific Event Notification (S):"> <xref

defines the SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY methods. These two methods provide a
general event notification framework for SIP. To actually use the
framework, extensions need to be defined for specific event
packages. An event package defines a schema for the event data and
describes other aspects of event processing specific to that
schema. An RFC 3265 implementation is required when any event package
is used.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3903, SIP Extension for Event State Publication (S):">

<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="RFC 3312, Integration of Resource Management and SIP (S):">
<xref target="RFC3312"/>, updated by <xref
target="RFC4032"/>,  defines a way to make sure that the
phone of the called party doesn't ring until a QoS reservation has
been installed in the network. It does so by defining a general
preconditions framework, which defines conditions that must be true in
order for a SIP session to proceed.</t>

<t hangText="QoS-ID, Quality of Service
         (QoS) Mechanism Selection in the Session Description Protocol

         <xref target="QoS-ID"/> defines a
         way for user agents to negotiate what type of end-to-end QoS
         mechanism to use for a session. At this time, there are two
         that can be used: the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)
         and Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS). This negotiation is done
         through an SDP extension. Due to limited deployment of RSVP
         and even more limited deployment of NSIS, this extension has
         not been widely used. </t>


<t hangText="RFC 3313, Private SIP Extensions for Media Authorization
(I):"> <xref target="RFC3313"/> defines a P-header that
provides a mechanism for passing an authorization token between SIP
and a network QoS reservation protocol like RSVP. Its purpose is to
make sure network QoS is only granted if a client has made a SIP call
through the same provider's network. This specification is sometimes
referred to as the SIP walled-garden specification by the truly
paranoid androids in the SIP community. This is because it requires
coupling of signaling and the underlying IP network.  </t>

<t hangText="RFC 3524, Mapping of Media Streams to Resource
Reservation Flows (S):"> <xref target="RFC3524"/>
defines a usage of the SDP grouping framework for indicating that a

Lists (S):"> <xref target="RFC4662"/>
defines a resource called a Resource List Server (RLS). A client can send a
subscribe to this server. The server
will generate a series of subscriptions, compile the resulting
information, and send it back to the subscriber. The set of resources
that the RLS will subscribe to is a property of the request URI in the
SUBSCRIBE request.

<t hangText="RFC 5363, Framework and Security Considerations for Session Initiation Protocol
         (SIP) Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)-List Services (S):">
         <xref target="RFC5363"/> defines the
         framework for list services in SIP. In this framework, a UA
         can include an XML list object in the body of various
         requests and the server will provide list-oriented services as a

</t>

<t hangText="RFC 4483, A Mechanism for Content Indirection in Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) Messages (S):"> <xref target="RFC4483"/>
  defines a mechanism for content indirection. Instead of

<t hangText="RFC 3893, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Authenticated
Identity Body (AIB) Format (S):"> <xref target="RFC3893"/> defines a
  SIP message fragment that can be signed in 
order to provide an authenticated identity over a request. It was an
early predecessor to <xref target="RFC4474"/>, and
consequently AIB has seen no deployment.
</t>

<t hangText="SAML, SIP SAML Profile and Binding (S):"> <xref
target="SAML"/> defines the usage of the
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) within SIP, and describes
how to use it in conjunction with SIP identity <xref
target="RFC4474"/> to provide authenticated assertions about a user's
role or attributes. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 5360, A Framework for
	     Consent-Based Communications in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) (S):"> <xref
target="RFC5360"/> defines
several extensions to SIP, including the Trigger-Consent and
Permission-Missing header fields. These header fields, in addition to
the other procedures defined in the document, define a way to manage
membership on "SIP mailing lists" used for instant messaging or
conferencing. In particular, it helps avoid the problem of using such
amplification services for the purposes of an attack on the network 
by making sure a user authorizes the addition of their address onto
such a service.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 5361, A Document Format for
	     Requesting Consent (S):">
	     <xref target="RFC5361"/> defines
	     an XML object used by the consent framework. Consent
	     documents are sent from SIP "mailing list servers" to
	     users to allow them to manage their membership on lists. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 5362, The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Pending Additions Event Package (S):"> <xref
target="RFC5362"/> defines a
SIP event package that allows a UA to learn whether consent has been
given for the addition of an address to a SIP "mailing list". It is
used in conjunction with the SIP framework for consent <xref
target="RFC5360"/>.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3329, Security Mechanism Agreement for SIP (S):">
  <xref target="RFC3329"/> defines a mechanism to prevent bid-down 
attacks in conjunction with SIP authentication. The mechanism has seen
very limited deployment. It was defined as part of the 3gpp IP
  Multimedia Subsystems (IMS)
specification suite <xref target="3GPP.24.229"/>, and is needed only
when there is a multiplicity 
of security mechanisms deployed at a particular server. In practice,
this has not been the case.
</t>


<t hangText="RFC 4572, Connection-Oriented Media Transport over the
Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol in the Session Description
Protocol (SDP) (S):"> <xref target="RFC4572"/> specifies a mechanism
  for signaling TLS-based media 
streams between endpoints. It expands the TCP-based media signaling
parameters defined in <xref target="RFC4145"/> to include fingerprint
information for TLS streams so that TLS can operate between end hosts
using self-signed certificates.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 5027, Security
	     Preconditions for Session Description Protocol Media Streams (S):"> <xref
target="RFC5027"/> defines
a precondition for use with the preconditions framework <xref
target="RFC3312"/>. The security precondition prevents a session from
being established until a security media stream is set up. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3310, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Authentication
Using Authentication and Key Agreement (S):"> <xref target="RFC3310"/>
  defines an extension to digest authentication to allow it to work
  with the credentials stored in cell phones. Though technically it is
  an extension to HTTP digest, its primary application is SIP. This
  extension is useful primarily to implementors of IMS.  
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 4169, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Authentication Using
            Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) Version-2 (S):">
            <xref target="RFC4169"/> is an enhancement to
            <xref target="RFC3310"/> that further improves security
            of the authentication. 
</t>

</list>

</section>

<section title="Conferencing">

<t>
Numerous SIP and SDP extensions are aimed at conferencing as their
primary application.
</t>

<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="RFC 4574, The SDP (Session Description Protocol) Label
Attribute (S):"> <xref target="RFC4574"/> defines an SDP attribute for providing an opaque label for
media streams. These labels can be referred to by external documents,
and in particular, by conference policy documents. This allows a UA to
tie together documents it may obtain through conferencing mechanisms
to media streams to which they refer.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3911, The SIP Join Header Field (S):"> <xref
target="RFC3911"/> defines the Join header field. When sent in an
INVITE, it causes the recipient to join the resulting dialog into a
conference with another dialog in progress. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 4575, A SIP Event Package for Conference State (S):">
<xref target="RFC4575"/> defines
a mechanism for learning about changes in conference state, including
conference membership.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 5368, Referring to Multiple
	     Resources in SIP (S):"> 
<xref target="RFC5368"/> allows a UA
sending a REFER to ask the recipient of the REFER to generate multiple
SIP requests, not just one. This is useful for conferencing, where a
client would like to ask a conference server to eject multiple users. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 5366, Conference
	     Establishment Using Request-Contained Lists in SIP (S):"> <xref
target="RFC5366"/> is 
similar to <xref
target="RFC5367"/>. However, instead
of subscribing to the resource, an INVITE request is sent to the
resource, and it will act as a conference focus and generate an
invitation to each recipient in the list.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC4579, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Call Control -
	     Conferencing for User Agents (B):">
	     <xref target="RFC4579"/> defines best practice procedures
	     and call flows for conferencing. This includes conference
	     creation, joining, and dial out, amongst other
	     capabilities. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 4583, Session Description Protocol (SDP) Format for
Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP) Streams (S):"> <xref
target="RFC4583"/> defines a mechanism
in SDP to signal floor control streams that use BFCP. It is used for
push-to-talk and conference floor control. 
</t>

</list>

</section>

<section title="Instant Messaging, Presence, and Multimedia">

<t>
SIP provides extensions for instant messaging, presence, and
multimedia.  
</t>

<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="RFC 3428, SIP Extension for Instant Messaging (S):"> 
<xref target="RFC3428"/> defines the MESSAGE method, used for sending
an instant message without setting up a session (sometimes called
"page mode").
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3856, A Presence Event Package for SIP (S):"> 
<xref target="RFC3856"/> defines an event package for indicating user
presence through SIP.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3857, A Watcher Information Event Template Package
for SIP (S):"> <xref target="RFC3857"/>, also known as winfo,
provides a mechanism for a user agent to find out what subscriptions
are in place for a particular event package. Its primary usage is with
presence, but it can be used with any event package.
</t>

<t hangText="TRANSFER-MECH, A Session
	     Description Protocol (SDP) 
Offer/Answer Mechanism to Enable File Transfer (S):"> <xref
target="TRANSFER-MECH"/> defines a
mechanism for signaling a file transfer session with SIP.
</t>

</list>

</section>

<section title="Emergency Services">

<t>
Emergency services include preemption features, which allow
authorized individuals to gain access to network resources in time of
emergency, along with traditional emergency calling. 
</t>

<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="RFC 4411, Extending the SIP Reason Header for Preemption
Events (S):"> <xref target="RFC4411"/> defines an extension to
the Reason header, allowing a UA to know that its dialog was torn down
because a higher priority session came through.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 4412, Communications Resource Priority for SIP (S):">
<xref target="RFC4412"/> defines a new header field,
Resource-Priority, that allows a session to get priority treatment
from the network.
</t>

<t hangText="LOCATION, Location Conveyance
	     for the Session Initiation Protocol (S):">
	     <xref target="LOCATION"/> defines
	     a mechanism for carrying location objects in SIP
	     messages. This is used to convey location from a UA to an
	     emergency call taker. </t>


</list>


</section>


<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>
This specification is an overview of existing specifications and does
not introduce any security considerations on its own. Of course, the
world would be far more secure if everyone would follow one simple
rule: "Don't Panic!" <xref target="HGTTG"/>.
