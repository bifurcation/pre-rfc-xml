<t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects to configure and/or
monitor Multicast communication over IP Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs) supported by the Multiprotocol Label Switching/Border Gateway
Protocol (MPLS/BGP) on a Provider Edge (PE) router.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t><xref target="RFC6513"/>, <xref target="RFC6514"/>, and <xref target="RFC6625"/> specify
procedures for supporting multicast in Multiprotocol Label Switching/Border Gateway
Protocol (MPLS/BGP) Layer 3 (IP)
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
Throughout this document, we will use the term
"MVPN" (for "multicast VPN") <xref target="RFC6513"/> to refer to a BGP/MPLS IP VPN
that supports multicast.</t>

<t>Provider Edge (PE) routers that attach to a particular MVPN exchange
customer multicast (C-multicast) routing information with neighboring PEs.
In <xref target="RFC6513"/>, two basic methods for exchanging C-multicast routing
information are defined: (1) Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) <xref target="RFC7761"/>
and (2) BGP.</t>

<t>In the rest of this document, we will use the term "PIM-MVPN" to refer
to the case where PIM is used for exchanging C-multicast routing information
and "BGP-MVPN" to refer to the case where BGP is used for exchanging C-multicast
routing information.</t>

<t>This document describes managed objects to configure and/or
monitor MVPNs. Most of the managed objects are common to both
PIM-MVPN and BGP-MVPN, and some managed objects are BGP-MVPN specific.</t>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

<t>This document adopts the definitions, abbreviations, and mechanisms
described in <xref target="RFC4364"/>, <xref target="RFC6513"/>, and <xref target="RFC6514"/>.
Familiarity with multicast, MPLS, Layer 3 (L3) VPN, and MVPN concepts and/or
mechanisms is assumed.
Some terms specifically related to this document are explained below.</t>

<t>An MVPN can be realized by using various
kinds of transport mechanisms for forwarding a packet to all or a subset of
PEs across service provider networks.
Such transport mechanisms are referred to as provider tunnels (P-tunnels).</t>

<t>A Provider Multicast Service Interface (PMSI) <xref target="RFC6513"/> is a conceptual
interface instantiated by a P-tunnel. A PE uses a PMSI to send customer
multicast traffic to all or some PEs in the same VPN.</t>

<t>There are two kinds of PMSIs: Inclusive PMSI (I-PMSI) and Selective
PMSI (S-PMSI) <xref target="RFC6513"/>. An I-PMSI enables a PE attached to
a particular MVPN to transmit a message to all PEs in the same MVPN.
An S-PMSI enables a PE to transmit a message to a selected set of PEs
in the same MVPN.</t>

<t>As described in <xref target="RFC4382"/>, each PE maintains one default
forwarding table and zero or more Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) tables.
Throughout this document, we will use the term "MVRF" (for "multicast VRF")
to refer to a VRF that contains multicast routing information.</t>

<t>    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
    described in BCP&nbsp;14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> 
    when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

<section anchor="the-internet-standard-management-framework" title="The Internet-Standard Management Framework">

<t>For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
RFC 3410 <xref target="RFC3410"/>.</t>

<t>Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
RFC 2578 <xref target="RFC2578"/>, STD 58, RFC 2579 <xref target="RFC2579"/> and STD 58,
RFC 2580 <xref target="RFC2580"/>.</t>

<t>This document defines BGP-MPLS-LAYER3-VPN-MULTICAST-MIB, a MIB module for
monitoring and/or configuring MVPNs on PEs.
This MIB module will be used in conjunction with MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB <xref target="RFC4382"></xref>
and IPMCAST-MIB <xref target="RFC5132"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="summary-of-mib-module" title="Summary of the MIB Module">

<t>BGP-MPLS-LAYER3-VPN-MULTICAST-MIB provides the following functionalities.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">

  <t>Monitoring attributes of MVPNs on a PE</t>
  <t>Configuring timers and thresholds related to an MVPN on a PE</t>
  <t>Notifying creation, deletion, and modification of MVRFs on a PE</t>

            unicast:
              The route would normally be placed only in
              the unicast RIB, but it was placed in the multicast
              RIB by local configuration, such as when running 
              PIM over RIP.

            multicast:
              The route was explicitly added to the multicast RIB by
              the routing protocol, such as the Distance Vector
              Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) or Multiprotocol BGP.

          TTL issues occur when the TTL (IPv4) or Hop Limit (IPv6)

          value less than ipMcastInterfaceTtl of the corresponding

          The ipMcastInterfaceTtl object is defined in IPMCAST-MIB
          (RFC 5132) and represents the datagram TTL
          threshold for the interface.  Any IP multicast datagrams
          with a TTL (IPv4) or Hop Limit (IPv6) less than this
          threshold will not be forwarded out of the interface.
          The default value of zero means all multicast packets are
          forwarded out of the interface.  A value of 256 means that
          no multicast packets are forwarded out of the interface.

<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<t>This MIB module contains some read-only objects that may be deemed sensitive.
It also contains some read-write objects whose settings will change
the device's MVPN-related behavior.
Appropriate security procedures that are related to SNMP in general
but are not specific to this MIB module need to be implemented by concerned
operators.</t>

<t>There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such
objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
environment without proper protection opens devices to attack.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>mvpnSPTunnelLimit  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The value of this object is used to control the maximum number of
selective provider tunnels that a PE allows for a particular MVPN.
Access to this object may be abused to impact the performance
of the PE or prevent the PE from having new selective provider tunnels.</t>
  <t>mvpnBgpCmcastRouteWithdrawalTimer  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The value of this object is used to control the delay for
the advertisement of withdrawals of C-multicast routes.
Access to this object may be abused to impact the performance of a PE.</t>
  <t>mvpnBgpSrcSharedTreeJoinTimer  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The value of this object is used to control the delay
for the advertisement of Source/Shared Tree Join C-multicast routes.
Access to this object may be abused to impact the propagation
of C-multicast routing information.</t>
  <t>mvpnBgpMsgRateLimit  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The value of this object is used to control the upper bound
for the rate of BGP C-multicast routing information message exchange
among PEs.
Access to this object may be abused to impact the performance
of the PE or disrupt the C-multicast routing information message
exchange using BGP.</t>
  <t>mvpnBgpMaxSpmsiAdRoutes  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The value of this object is used to control the upper bound
for the number of S-PMSI A-D routes.
Access to this object may be abused to impact the performance
of the PE or prevent the PE from receiving S-PMSI A-D routes.</t>
  <t>mvpnBgpMaxSpmsiAdRouteFreq  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The value of this object is used to control the upper bound
for the frequency of S-PMSI A-D route generation.
Access to this object may be abused to impact the performance
of the PE or prevent the PE from generating new S-PMSI A-D routes.</t>
  <t>mvpnBgpMaxSrcActiveAdRoutes  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The value of this object is used to control the upper bound
for the number of Source Active A-D routes.
Access to this object may be abused to impact the performance
of the PE or prevent the PE from receiving Source Active A-D routes.</t>
  <t>mvpnBgpMaxSrcActiveAdRouteFreq  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The value of this object is used to control the upper bound
for the frequency of Source Active A-D route generation.
Access to this object may be abused to impact the performance
of the PE or prevent the PE from generating new Source Active A-D routes.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Some of the objects in this MIB module may be considered sensitive
  or vulnerable in some network environments.  This includes INDEX
  objects with a MAX-ACCESS of not-accessible, and any indices from
  other modules exposed via AUGMENTS.  It is thus important to
  control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
  to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
  the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
  sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The address-related objects in this MIB module may have impact
on privacy and security.
These objects may reveal the locations of senders and recipients.
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>mvpnPmsiTunnelPimGroupAddr</t>
      <t>mvpnSpmsiCmcastGroupAddr</t>
      <t>mvpnSpmsiCmcastSourceAddr</t>
      <t>mvpnAdvtPeerAddr</t>
      <t>mvpnMrouteCmcastGroupAddr</t>
      <t>mvpnMrouteCmcastSourceAddrs</t>
      <t>mvpnMrouteUpstreamNeighborAddr</t>
      <t>mvpnMrouteRtAddr</t>
      <t>mvpnMrouteNextHopGroupAddr</t>
      <t>mvpnMrouteNextHopSourceAddrs</t>
      <t>mvpnMrouteNextHopAddr</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
there is no control as to who on the secure network is
allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
in this MIB module.</t>

<t>Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"/>), and implementations claiming compliance
to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and
privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM) <xref target="RFC3414"/> with the AES
cipher algorithm <xref target="RFC3826"/>. Implementations MAY also provide support for
the Transport Security Model (TSM) <xref target="RFC5591"/> in combination with a secure
transport such as SSH <xref target="RFC5592"/> or TLS/DTLS <xref target="RFC6353"/>.</t>

<t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.</t>
