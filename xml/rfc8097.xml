    an autonomous system. Internal BGP (IBGP) speakers that receive this validation state 
    can configure local policies that allow it to influence their decision

    This document defines a new BGP opaque 
    extended community to carry the origination AS validation state inside 
    an autonomous system. IBGP speakers that receive this validation state 
    can configure local policies that allow it to influence their decision process.

  The origin validation state extended community is an opaque extended

  The value of the high-order octet of the extended Type field is 0x43,
  which indicates it is non-transitive.  The value of the low-order
  octet of the extended Type field as assigned by IANA is 0x00.  The Reserved
  field MUST be set to 0 and ignored upon the receipt of this community. The last
  octet of the extended community is an unsigned integer that gives the route's validation
  state <xref target="RFC6811"></xref>.  It can assume the following values:
</t>

                  +-------+-----------------------------+
                  | Value | Meaning                     |
                  +-------+-----------------------------+
                  |   0   | Lookup result = "valid"     |
                  |   1   | Lookup result = "not found" |
                  |   2   | Lookup result = "invalid"   |
                  +-------+-----------------------------+
</artwork>
</figure>
 </t>

<t>
  If the router is configured to support the extensions defined in this
  document, it SHOULD attach the origin validation state extended
  community to BGP UPDATE messages sent to IBGP peers by mapping the
  computed validation state in the last octet of the extended
  community.  Similarly, a receiving BGP speaker, in the absence of validation
  state set based on local data, SHOULD derive a validation state from
  the last octet of the extended community, if present.
</t>
<t>
  An implementation SHOULD NOT send more than one instance of the
  origin validation state extended community. However, if more than 
  one instance is received, an implementation MUST disregard all 
  instances other than the one with the numerically greatest validation state value.
  If the value received is greater than the largest specified value
  (2), the implementation MUST apply a strategy similar to attribute
  discard <xref target="RFC7606"/> by discarding the erroneous community
  and logging the error for further analysis.
</t>
<t>
  By default, implementations MUST drop the origin validation state
  extended community if received from an External BGP (EBGP) peer, without 
  processing it further. Similarly, by default, an implementation SHOULD NOT send
  the community to EBGP peers. However, it SHOULD be possible to
  configure an implementation to send or accept the community when
  warranted. An example of a case where the community would reasonably
  be received from, or sent to, an EBGP peer is when two adjacent ASes
  are under control of the same administration. A second example is
  documented in <xref target="SIDR-RPKI"></xref>.
</t>

</section>


<section title="Deployment Considerations">
<t>
  In deployment scenarios in which not all the speakers in an autonomous
  system are upgraded to support the extensions defined in this
  document, it is necessary to define policies that match on the origin
   validation extended community and set another BGP attribute <xref
   target="RFC6811"></xref> that influences selection of the best path in the
   same way that an implementaion of this extension would.   
</t>
</section>


<section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
  <t>
	IANA has registered the value 0x00, with the name "BGP Origin
	Validation State Extended Community", in the "Non-Transitive Opaque
	Extended Community Sub-Types" registry.  
  </t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
    Security considerations such as those described in <xref
    target="RFC4272"/> continue to apply. Because this document introduces
    an extended community that will generally be used to affect route
    selection, the analysis in Section 4.5 ("Falsification") of <xref
    target="RFC4593"/> is relevant. These issues are neither new nor
    unique to the origin validation extended community.
</t>
<t>
	The security considerations provided in <xref target="RFC6811"/>
	apply equally to this application of origin validation. In addition,
	this document describes a scheme where router A outsources
	validation to some router B. If this scheme is used, the
	participating routers should have the appropriate trust relationship
	-- B should trust A either because they are under the same
	administrative control or for some other reason (for example,
	consider <xref target="SIDR-RPKI"/>).
The security properties of the TCP connection between the two routers should
also be considered.  See Section 5.1 of <xref target="RFC7454"/> for advice
regarding protection of the TCP connection.
