    <section title='Introduction'>

      <t>E.164 Number Mapping (ENUM) <xref target='RFC6116'/> 
      provides an identifier mapping
      mechanism to map <xref target='ITU.E164.2005'>E.164 numbers</xref> to
      <xref target='RFC3986'>Uniform Resource Identifiers
      (URIs)</xref> using the <xref target='RFC1035'>Domain Name
      System (DNS)</xref>.  One of the primary concepts of ENUM is the
      definition of "Enumservices", which allows for providing
      different URIs for different applications of said mapping
      mechanism.
      </t>

      <t>This document specifies a revision of the IANA registry for
      Enumservices, which was originally described
      in <xref target='RFC3761'/>. This document obsoletes Section 3 of
RFC 3761 while RFC 6116 obsoletes RFC 3761.
      </t>

      <t>
      The new registration processes, which are detailed in <xref target='processReg'/>, 
      have been specifically designed 
      to be decoupled from the existence of 
      the ENUM working group. Compared to RFC 3761, the main
      changes are as follows:
      </t>

        <vspace blankLines='1'/>
        <list style='symbols'>

          <t>For an Enumservice to be inserted to the IANA registry,
          "Specification Required", which implies the use of a
          Designated Expert, according to <xref target='RFC5226'>"Guidelines
          for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs"</xref>,
          are now sufficient.
          </t>

          <vspace blankLines='1'/>
          <t>The IANA Registration Template has been supplemented with
          elements for "Enumservice Class" and "Enumservice Specification".

          </t>

        </list>
      
      <t>The IETF's ENUM Working Group has encountered an unnecessary
      amount of variation in the format of Enumservice Specifications.
      The ENUM Working Group's view of what particular 
      information is required and/or recommended has also evolved,
      and capturing these best current practices is helpful in both
      the creation of new Enumservice Specifications, as well as the
      revision or refinement of existing Enumservice Specifications.
      </t>

    </section>


    <section title="Terminology">

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
      in <xref target='RFC2119' />.
      </t>

      <t>For the purpose of this document:
  
        <vspace blankLines='1'/>
        <list style='symbols'>
              
          <t>"Registration Document" refers to a draft specification
            that defines an Enumservice and proposes its registration
            following the procedures outlined herein.
          </t>

          <vspace blankLines='1'/>
          <t>"Enumservice Specification" refers to a Registration
            Document that has been approved by the experts and
            published according to "Specification Required" as defined
            in <xref target='RFC5226'/>.
          </t>

        </list>
      </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor='requirements' title='Registration Requirements'>

        <t>As specified in the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF, 
        <xref target='RFC5234'/>) found in Section 3.4.3 of 
        <xref target='RFC6116'/>, an Enumservice is made
        up of Types and Subtypes.  For any given Type, the allowable
        Subtypes (if any) must be defined in the Enumservice
        Specification.  There is currently no concept of a registered
        Subtype outside the scope of a given Type.
        </t>

        <t>While the combination of each Type and all of its Subtypes
        constitutes the allowed values for the "Enumservice" field, it
        is not sufficient to just list their allowed values.
        To allow for interoperability, a complete
        Enumservice Specification MUST document the semantics of the Type and
        Subtype values to be registered, and MUST contain all
        sections listed in <xref target='requiredSections'/> of this
        document.</t>

        <t>Furthermore, in order for an Enumservice to be registered,
        the entire Registration Document requires approval by the
        experts according to "Specification Required", which implies
        the use of a Designated Expert, as set out
        in <xref target='RFC5226'>"Guidelines for Writing an IANA
        Considerations Section in RFCs"</xref> and
        <xref target='ExpRevGuidelines' /> of this document.
        </t>

        <t>All Enumservice Specifications are expected to conform also
        to various requirements laid out in the following sections.
        </t>

        <section anchor='FunctReq' title='Functionality Requirements'>

          <t>A registered Enumservice must be able to function as a
          selection mechanism for choosing
          one <xref target='RFC3403'>Naming Authority Pointer
          (NAPTR) </xref> DNS Resource Record (RR) from a set of such
          RRs.  That means the Enumservice Specification MUST define
          how to use the NAPTR RR and the URI(s) the NAPTR RR resolves
          to.
          </t>

          <t>Specifically, a registered Enumservice MUST specify the
          URI Scheme(s) that may be used for the Enumservice, and,
          when needed, other information that will have to be
          transferred into the URI resolution process itself.
          </t>

        </section>

        <section anchor='NamingReq' title='Naming Requirements'>

          <t>The name of an Enumservice MUST be unique in order to be useful as a
          selection criteria:
        
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            <list style='symbols'>
              
              <t>The Type MUST be unique.
              </t>
            
              <vspace blankLines='1'/>
              <t>The Subtype (being dependent on the Type) MUST be
              unique within a given Type.
              </t>

            </list>
          </t>

          <t>Types and Subtypes MUST conform to the ABNF specified in
          Section 3.4.3 of <xref target='RFC6116'/>.
          </t>

          <t>The ABNF specified in Section 3.4.3 of
          <xref target='RFC6116'/> allows the "-" (dash)
          character for Types and Subtypes. To avoid confusion with
          possible future prefixes, a "-" MUST NOT be used as the
          first nor as the second character of a Type nor a Subtype.
          Furthermore, a "-" MUST NOT be used as the last character of
          a Type nor a Subtype.  In addition, Types and Subtypes are
          case insensitive and SHOULD be specified in lowercase letters.
          </t>

          <t>Note: The legacy IANA registry of Enumservices contains
          Type and Subtype strings with uppercase letters.
          Implementors could be tempted to refuse handling uppercase
          Type or Subtype strings, which could negatively affect
          interoperability.
          </t>

          <t>To avoid confusion with Enumservice fields using a deprecated 
          (obsolete) syntax, Type and Subtype MUST
          NOT start with the string "e2u".
          </t>

          <t>The Subtype for one Type MAY have the same identifier as
          a Subtype for
          another Type, but it is not sufficient to
          simply reference another Type's Subtype.  The functionality
          of each Subtype MUST be fully specified in the context 
          of the Type being registered.
          </t>

          <t><xref target='cookbook'/> contains further naming
          requirements.
          </t>


        </section>

        <section anchor='SecReq' title='Security Requirements'>

          <t>An analysis of security issues is REQUIRED for all
          registered Enumservices. (This is in accordance with the
          basic requirements for all IETF protocols.)
          </t>

          <t>All descriptions of security issues MUST be as accurate
          and extensive as feasible.  In particular,
          a statement that there are "no security issues associated
          with this Enumservice" must not be confused with "the
          security issues associated with this Enumservice have not
          been assessed".
          </t>

          <t>There is no requirement that an Enumservice must be
          completely free of security risks.  Nevertheless, all known
          security risks MUST be identified in an Enumservice
          Specification.
          </t>

          <!--
          <t>The security considerations section of Enumservice
          Specifications is subject to continuing evaluation and
          modification, in accordance with
          <xref target='ChangeControl'/>.
          </t>
          -->

          <t>Some of the issues to be looked at in a security
          analysis of an Enumservice are:

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            <list style='numbers'>

              <t>Complex Enumservices may include provisions for
              directives that institute actions on a user's resources.
              In many cases provision can be made to specify arbitrary
              actions in an unrestricted fashion which may then have
              devastating results (especially if there is a risk for
              a new ENUM look-up, and because of that an infinite loop
              in the overall resolution process of the E.164 number).
              </t>

              <vspace blankLines='1'/>
              <t>Complex Enumservices may include provisions for
              directives that institute actions which, while not
              directly harmful, may result in disclosure of
              information that either facilitates a subsequent attack
              or else violates the users' privacy in some way.
              </t>

              <vspace blankLines='1'/>
              <t>An Enumservice might be targeted for applications
              that require some sort of security assurance but do not
              provide the necessary security mechanisms themselves.
              For example, an Enumservice could be defined for storage
              of confidential security services information such as
              alarm systems or message service passcodes, which in
              turn require an external confidentiality service.
              </t>

            </list>

          </t>

        </section>

        <section anchor='PubReq' title='Publication Requirements'>

          <t>Enumservices Specifications MUST be published according
          to the requirements for "Specification Required" set out
          in <xref target='RFC5226'>"Guidelines for Writing an IANA
          Considerations Section in RFCs"</xref>.  RFCs fulfill these
          requirements. Therefore, it is strongly RECOMMENDED to
          publish Enumservice Specifications as RFCs.
          </t>

          <t>In case the Enumservice Specification is not published as
          an RFC, sufficient information that allows unique identification
          of the Enumservice Specification MUST be provided.
          </t>

    </section>

    <section  anchor='cookbook' title='Enumservice Creation Cookbook'>

      <section title='General Enumservice Considerations'>

        <t>ENUM is an extremely flexible identifier mapping mechanism,
        using E.164 (phone) numbers as input identifiers, and returning 
        URIs as output identifiers. Because of this flexibility, almost 
        every use case for ENUM could be implemented in several ways.
        </t>

        <t>Section 2 of <xref target='RFC5226'>"Guidelines for Writing an IANA 
        Considerations Section in RFCs"</xref> provides motivation for why 
        management of a namespace might be necessary. Even though the 
        namespace for Enumservices is rather large (up to 32 alphanumeric 
        characters), there are reasons to manage this in accordance with 
        Section 2 of <xref target='RFC5226'/>.  The following is a list of 
        motivations applying to Enumservices:

        <vspace blankLines='1'/>
        <list style='symbols'>

          <t>Prevent hoarding or wasting of values: Enumservice Types
          are not an opaque identifier to prevent collisions in the
          namespace, but rather identify the use of a certain
          technology in the context of ENUM.  Service Types might also
          be displayed to end users in implementations, so meaningful
          Type strings having a clear relation to the protocols and
          applications used are strongly RECOMMENDED.
          Therefore, preventing hoarding, wasting, or "hijacking" of
          Enumservice Type strings is important.
          </t>

          <vspace blankLines='1'/>
          <t>Sanity check to ensure sensible or necessary requests:
          This applies to Enumservices, since especially various
          Enumservices for the same purpose would reduce the chance of
          successful interoperability, and unnecessarily increase
          confusion among implementers.
          </t>

          <vspace blankLines='1'/>
          <t>Delegation of namespace portions: Theoretically, the Type
          and/or Subtype structure of Enumservices would allow for
          delegations of Type values, and self-supporting management
          of Subtype values by a delegate within the Type value. Such
          delegates could, for example, be other standardization
          bodies. However, this would require clear policies regarding
          publication and use of such Subtypes. Delegation of
          Enumservice namespace portions is therefore currently not
          supported.
          </t>

          <vspace blankLines='1'/>
          <t>Interoperability: Since the benefit of an Enumservice
          rises with the number of supporting clients, the
          registration and use of several services for a similar or
          identical purpose clearly reduces interoperability.
          Operational circumstances suggest to keep the space occupied
          by all services published in the NAPTR RRSet at any owner in
          the e164.arpa domain bounded. Registration of nearly
          identical services and subsequent competing or parallel use
          could easily increase the DNS operational complexity.
          </t>
        </list>
        </t>
        
        <t>Generally, before commencing work on a new Enumservice 
        registration, the following should be considered:

          <vspace blankLines='1'/>

          <list style='symbols'>

            <t>Is there an existing Enumservice that could fulfill the
            desired functionality without overloading it? Check the IANA
            Enumservice Registry at

<!-- [rfced] IANA, please verify that you approve the IANA URLs provided in

            </t>

            <t><xref target='classification'/> provides three general 
            categories for Enumservice classification. In some cases, there
            might be several options for designing an Enumservice. For 
            example, a mapping service using HTTP could be considered a 
            "protocol Type" Enumservice (using HTTP as the protocol), 
            while it could also be viewed as
            an "application Type" Enumservice, with the application providing
            access to mapping services. 
            In such a case where several options are 
            available, defining use cases before commencing work on 
            the Enumservice itself might be useful before making a 
            decision on which  
            aspect of the Enumservice is more important.

      <section anchor='classification' title='Classification, Type and Subtype'>
        <t>Because of their flexibility, Enumservices can be and are used
        in a lot of different ways. This section contains a classification
        of Enumservices, and provides guidance for choosing suitable 
        Type and Subtype strings for each individual Enumservice
        Class. 
        </t>

        <t>The Classification of each Enumservice MUST be listed in
        the Registration Document (see
        <xref target='enumServiceReg'/>).  If the Enumservice cannot be
        assigned to one of the classes outlined below, the
        Registration Document MUST contain a section on the
        difficulties encountered while trying to classify the service
        to help the experts in their decision.
        </t>
        
        <section anchor='generalcons' title='General Type/Subtype Considerations'>
          <t>To avoid confusion, the name of a URI Scheme MUST NOT be
          used as a Type string for an Enumservice that is not specifically
          about the respective protocol or URI Scheme. For example,
          the Type string "imap" would be inadequate for use in an
          Enumservice about "Internet mapping" services, because it
          corresponds to an existing URI Scheme / protocol for
          something different.
          </t>

          <t>If Subtypes are defined, the minimum number SHOULD be
          two (including the empty Subtype, if defined). 
          The choice of just one possible Subtype for a given Type
          does not add any information when selecting an ENUM record,
          and hence can be left out completely.
          However, potential future expansion of a Type towards several
          Subtypes may justify the use of Subtypes, even in the case that
          just one is currently defined, as noted in 
          <xref target='ExtensionOfExisting'/>.
          </t>

          <t>It is perfectly legal under a certain Type to mix the
          Enumservice without a Subtype (empty Subtype) with Enumservices 
          containing
          a Subtype. In that case, however, the Enumservice with an
          empty Subtype SHOULD be specified to reflect the base
          service, while the other Enumservices SHOULD
          be specified to reflect variants.

          <t>A good indication that an Enumservice belongs to this Class is

        <section anchor='applicationclass' title='Application-Based Enumservice Classes'>

          <t>Application-based Enumservices are used when the kind of
          service intended is not fully defined by a protocol specification.
          There are three cases here:

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            <list style='symbols'>

            <t>Common Application Enumservice:

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            The application reflects a kind of interaction that can be realized
            by different protocols, but where the intent of the publisher is the
            same. From a user's perspective, there is a common kind of interaction --
            how that interaction is implemented is not important. The Enumservice
            Specification MUST describe the interaction and expected behavior in
            enough detail that an implementation can decide if this activity is one
            in which it can engage. However, it is RECOMMENDED that the Enumservice
            be defined in a way that will allow others to use it at a later date. An
            Enumservice that defines a generalized application is preferred to one
            that has narrow use.

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            An example of this flavor of Enumservice is email. Whilst this might
            appear to be a "pure" protocol scheme, it is not. The URI Scheme is
            'mailto', and it does not identify the protocol used to offer or
            retrieve emails by the sender or the recipient. 

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            Another example is the Short Messaging Service (SMS), where the
            existence of such an Enumservice
            indicates that the publishing entity is capable of engaging in sending
            or receiving a message according to the SMS
            specifications. The underlying protocol used and the URI Scheme for the
            addressable end point can differ, but the "user visible" interaction of
            sending and receiving an SMS is similar.
            </t>         

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            <t>Subset Enumservice:

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            The application interaction reflects a subset of the interactions
            possible by use of a protocol. Use of this Enumservice indicates that
            some options available by use of the protocol will not be accepted or
            are not possible in this case. Any such Enumservice Specification MUST
            define the options available by use of this NAPTR in enough detail that
            an implementation can decide whether or not it can use this Enumservice.

            Examples of this kind of Enumservice are "voice:tel" and "fax:tel". In both
            cases, the URI holds a telephone number. However, the essential feature
            of these Enumservices is that the telephone number is capable of
            receiving a voice call or of receiving a Facsimile transmission,
            respectively. These form subsets of the interactions capable of using
            the telephone number, and so have their own Enumservices. These allow an
            end point to decide if it has the appropriate capability to engage in
            the advertised user service (a voice call or sending a fax) rather than
            just being capable of making a connection to such a destination address.
            This is especially important where there is no underlying mechanism
            within the protocol to negotiate a different kind of user interaction.
            </t>

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            <t>Ancillary Application Enumservice

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            Another variant on this is the Ancillary Application. This is one in
            which further processing (potentially using a number of different
            protocols or methods) is the intended result of using this Enumservice.
            An example of this kind of application is the "pstn:tel" Enumservice. This
            indicates that the NAPTR holds number portability data. It implies that
            the client should engage in number portability processing using the
            associated URI.

            Note that this Enumservice usually does not itself define the kind of
            interaction available using the associated URI. That application is
            negotiated with some other "out of band" means (either through prior
            negotiation, or explicitly through the number portability process, or
            through negotiation following the selection of the final destination
            address).

      <section title='Examples (REQUIRED)'>

        <t>This section MUST show at least one example of the Enumservice being
        registered, for illustrative purposes.  The example(s) shall in no
        way limit the various forms that a given Enumservice may take, and this
        should be noted at the beginning of this section of the document.
        The example(s) MUST show the specific formatting of the intended NAPTRs
        (according to <xref target='RFC3403'/> 
        and <xref target='RFC6116'/>), 
        including one or more NAPTR example(s),
        AND a brief textual description, consisting of one or more sentences
        written in plain English, explaining the various parts or attributes
        of the record(s).
        </t>

        <t>The example(s) SHOULD contain a brief description how a client
        supporting this Enumservice could behave, if that description
        was not already given in, e.g., the Introduction or the Functional
        Specification.
        </t>

        <t>The example(s) SHOULD follow any relevant IETF guidelines on the use 
        of domain names, phone numbers, and other resource identifier 
        examples, such as <xref target='RFC2606'/>.

      <section title='Implementation Recommendations / Notes (OPTIONAL)'>

        <t>Recommendations that pertain to
        implementation and/or operations SHOULD be included.  Such a
        section is helpful to someone reading an Enumservice
        Specification and trying to understand how best to use it to
        support their network or service.
        </t>

      </section>


      <section title='DNS Considerations (REQUIRED)'>

        <t>In case the inclusion of protocols and URI Schemes into
        ENUM specifically introduces new DNS issues, those MUST be
        described within this section.
        </t>

        <t>Such DNS issues include, but are not limited to:

          <vspace blankLines='1'/>
          <list style='symbols'>

            <t>Assumptions about ownership or administrative control of the 
            namespace.
            <vspace blankLines='1'/></t>

            <t>Requirement or need to use DNS wildcards.
            <vspace blankLines='1'/></t>

            <t>Incompatibility with DNS wildcards.
            <vspace blankLines='1'/></t>

            <t>Presence or absence of respective NAPTR Resource Records at 
            particular levels in the DNS hierarchy (e.g., only for "full"
            E.164 numbers or wildcards only).
            <vspace blankLines='1'/></t>

            <t>Use of any Resource Records (especially non-NAPTR) within or 
            beyond the e164.arpa namespace other than those needed to resolve
            the domain names that appear in the "replacement" URI.
            </t>
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>

            <t>Potential for significant additional load on the nameserver
            chain due to use of the service, and the mitigation of such
            additional load.</t>
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>

            <t>Mitigation of potential for DNS loops, specifically in
            cases where the result URI of an Enumservice might be used
            to trigger additional (subsequent) ENUM queries. This
            applies in particular to Enumservices using
            the <xref target='RFC3966'>'tel' URI Scheme</xref> or any
            other (future) URI Scheme using (E.164) numbers.
            <xref target='RFC4759'>"The ENUM Dip Indicator Parameter
            for the tel URI"</xref> provides an example of a
            loop mitigation mechanism.
            </t>

          </list>
        </t>

        <t>Rationale: some Enumservices try to exploit side effects
        of the DNS that need to be explicitly discussed.
        </t>

      </section>


      <section anchor='sec' title='Security Considerations (REQUIRED)'>

        <t>A section explaining any potential security threats that are especially 
        applicable to the given registration MUST be included. 
        This MUST also include any information about access to Personally Identifiable 
        Information (PII).
        </t>

        <t>An Enumservice Specification SHOULD NOT
        include general and obvious security recommendations, such as 
        securing servers with strong password authentication.   
        </t>

        <t>For additional background, please note that <xref target='RFC3552'/> 
        provides guidance to write a good Security Considerations section. In 
        addition, <xref target='RFC6116'/> already outlines
        security considerations affecting ENUM as a whole.
        Enumservice Specifications do not need to and SHOULD NOT
        repeat considerations already listed in that document.
        However, Enumservice Specifications SHOULD include a reference
        to that section.
        </t>

        <t>Also, ENUM refers to resources using existing URI Schemes and protocols.
        Enumservice Specifications do not need to and SHOULD NOT repeat
        security considerations affecting those protocols and URI Schemes
        themselves.
        </t>

        <t>However, in some cases, the inclusion of those protocols and URI
        Schemes into ENUM specifically could introduce new security issues.  In 
        these cases, those issues or risks MUST be covered in the "Security 
        Considerations" section of the Enumservice Specification.
        Authors should pay particular attention to any indirect risks that are 
        associated with a proposed Enumservice, including cases where the 
        proposed Enumservice could lead to the discovery or disclosure of 
        Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
        </t>
        
      </section>


      <section title='IANA Considerations (REQUIRED)'>

        <t>Describe the task IANA needs to fulfill to process the
        Enumservice Registration Document.
        </t>

        <t>For example:<vspace blankLines='0'/>
        This document requests the IANA registration of the
        Enumservice with Type "foo" and Subtype "bar" according
        to the definitions in this document, [RFC&rfc.number;],
        and <xref target='RFC6116'/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          <vspace blankLines='0'/>For example:

          <vspace blankLines='0'/>This document requests an update of
          the IANA registration of the Enumservice Type "foo" with
          Subtype "bar", according to the definitions in this document, [RFC&rfc.number;],
          and <xref target='RFC6116'/>.
          Therefore, in the existing IANA registration for this
          Enumservice, the &lt;registrationdocs&gt; element
          (Enumservice Specification) is enhanced
          by adding a supplementary reference that points to this
          document.
        </t>

        <t>
          <vspace blankLines='0'/>For example:

          <vspace blankLines='0'/>This document requests an update of
          the IANA registration of the Enumservice Type "foo" with
          all its Subtypes, in order to declare it deprecated.
          Therefore, in the existing IANA registration for this
          Enumservice, the &lt;usage&gt; element (Intended Usage) is
          changed to "DEPRECATED", and the &lt;registrationdocs&gt;
          element (Enumservice Specification) is enhanced by adding a
          supplementary reference that points to this document.
          
        </t>

      </section>



      <section title='Other Sections (OPTIONAL)'>

        <t>Other sections beyond those required above MAY be included in an 
        Enumservice Specification. These sections may relate to the specifics
        of the intended use of the Enumservice registration, as well as to any 
        associated technical, operational, administrative, or other concerns.
        </t>  
        <t>A use case SHOULD be included by the authors of the proposal, so
        that experts can better understand the problem the proposal seeks 
        to solve (intended use of the Enumservice). The inclusion of such a
        use case will both accelerate the Expert Review process, as well as
        make any eventual registration easier to understand and implement
        by other parties.</t>

      <section title='Step 5: Expert Review'>

        <t>IANA will take care of the "Expert Review" according
        to <xref target='RFC5226'></xref>.  The Expert Review
        guidelines are outlined in <xref target='ExpRevGuidelines'/>
        of this document. The authors must be prepared for further
        interaction with IANA and the experts.</t>

        <section title='Outcome 1: Experts Approve the Registration Document'>

          <t>No (more) changes to the Registration Document are made.
          IANA will inform the authors, who then will proceed to
          Step 6 below.</t>

        </section>

        <section title='Outcome 2: Changes Required'>

          <t>The experts might require changes before they can approve
          the Registration Document. The authors update and submit
          the Registration Document. The authors inform the experts
          about the available update, who then continue the Expert
          Review Process.
          </t>

        </section>

        <section title='Outcome 3: Experts Reject the Registration Document'>

          <t>The expert might reject the Registration, which means the
          Expert Review process is discontinued.</t>

      </section>


      <section anchor='Step6' title='Step 6: Publication of the Registration Document'>

        <t>The authors are responsible for ensuring that the Registration
        Document is published according to "Specification Required" as
        defined in <xref target='RFC5226'></xref>.</t>

        <t>As set out in <xref target='PubReq' /> it is strongly
        RECOMMENDED that Enumservice Specifications be published RFCs. 
 As
        to every RFC, the normal IETF publication process applies (see
        <xref target='Instructions2authors'/>); i.e., the Registration
        Document is submitted in the form of an Internet Draft
        (e.g. via an IETF Working Group or a sponsoring Area
        Director). <xref target='Instructions2authors'/> also
        contains an option to publish an RFC as 'Independent
        Submission', which is further described in
        <xref target='RFC4846'>"Independent Submissions to the RFC
        Editor"</xref>.</t>

     </section>

      <section anchor='Step7' title='Step 7: Adding Enumservice to the IANA Registry'>

        <t>In cases where the Registration Document is to be published as
        an RFC, the RFC publication process ensures that IANA will add
        the Enumservice to the registry.</t>

        <t>In cases where the Registration Document is to be published in a
        specification other than RFC, the authors must inform IANA, as
        soon as the Enumservice Specification has been published
        according to "Specification Required" as defined
        in <xref target='RFC5226'></xref>. The &lt;registrationdocs&gt;
        element in the IANA Registration Template must contain an
        unambiguous reference to the Enumservice Specification (see
        also <xref target='enumServiceReg'></xref>). In addition, the
        authors must provide IANA with a stable URL to the Enumservice
        Specification, in order that IANA may obtain the information
        included in the Enumservice Specification. IANA will then add
        the Enumservice to the registry.</t>

        experts are appointed by the IESG. The IESG is responsible for
        ensuring that there is always a sufficient pool of experts

      <section anchor='ExpRevGuidelines' title='Review Guidelines'>
  
        <t>Generally, the "Expert Review" process of an Enumservice
        follows the guidelines documented in Section 3.3
        of <xref target='RFC5226'>"Guidelines for Writing an IANA
        Considerations Section in RFCs"</xref>.  Note that RFC 5226
        says 'The review may be wide or narrow, depending on the
        situation and the judgment of the designated expert'.
        Therefore, the following list should be considered a

            </t>
  
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            <t>Verify that the Enumservice proposed cannot be confused

            </t>
  
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            <t>In case the Enumservice is not classified, the

    <section anchor='RevisionOfExisting' title='Revision of Existing Enumservice Specifications'>

      <t>Many Enumservice registrations, published via IETF RFCs,
      already exist at the time of the development of this document.
      These existing Enumservice Specifications MAY be revised to comply
      with the specifications contained herein. All revisions of
      Enumservice Specifications MUST be compliant with the specifications
      contained herein.
      </t>

      <t>Note: Enumservice Specifications updated only
      by <xref target='RFC6118' /> are not compliant

      </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor='ExtensionOfExisting' title='Extension of Existing Enumservice Specifications'>

      <t>There are cases where it is more sensible to extend an
      existing Enumservice registration rather than propose a new
      one. Such cases include adding a new Subtype to an existing
      Type. Depending on the nature of the extension, the original
      Enumservice Specification needs to be extended (Updates) or replaced
      (Obsoletes) <xref target='RFC2223'></xref>.
      Specifically, an update is appropriate when a new Subtype is
      being added without changes to the existing repertoire. A
      replacement is needed if there is a change to the default,
      or changes to the assumptions of URI support in clients.
      </t>

      <t>Any Enumservice Specifications for existing Enumservices that
      are extended MUST comply with the specifications contained
      herein. As a consequence, revisions of existing Enumservice
      Specifications may be required according
      to <xref target='RevisionOfExisting'></xref>.

        <t>Approved Enumservice registrations are published in the

        <vspace blankLines='0' />
        &lt;http://www.iana.org/assignments/enum-services&gt;.

        <t>This registry publishes representations derived from

        and specified in <xref target='enumServiceReg'/>.
        </t>

        <t>Where the Enumservice Specification is not an RFC, IANA must hold

      <section anchor='expertReviewProcedure' title='Expert Review Procedure'>

        <t>Whenever a Registration Document is submitted via the

        process according to <xref target='RFC5226'>"Guidelines for
        Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs"</xref>.</t>

        <t>To prevent clashes, IANA will check whether a request with
        identical "type:subtype" (or "type" without Subtype) was
        submitted for Expert Review earlier and will inform the
        experts accordingly. The experts are authorized to resolve
        clashes as they see fit. The requesters may need to update
        their registration request before getting expert approval.</t>

        <t>Once the experts have conditionally approved the Enumservice, IANA will
        inform the authors. This information should also include a
        reminder that (i) the authors are now responsible for
        publication of the Registration Document (see
        also <xref target='Step6'></xref>) and (ii) the Enumservice
        will be added to the IANA registry only after its
        Enumservice Specification is published according to
        the "Specification Required" policy as defined
        in <xref target='RFC5226'></xref> (see
        also <xref target='Step7'></xref>).</t>

        <t>Note: After sending the approval note to the authors, IANA
        has no further responsibilities besides keeping internal
        records of approved Registration Documents.  IANA will be
        involved again at registration of the Enumservice (see
        <xref target='ianaRegistrationProcedure'></xref>).</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor='ianaRegistrationProcedure' title='Registration Procedure'>

        <t>There is a slight difference in process depending on
        whether or not the Enumservice Specification will be
        published as an RFC. The reason for this difference lies in the

        interaction shortly before publication of an RFC.</t>

        <section anchor='RegistrationRFC' title='Published as an RFC'>
          

          <t>As per the RFC publication process, IANA will receive the
          Enumservice Specification to carry out IANA actions
          shortly before publication of the RFC. The IANA action
          will be to register the Enumservice, i.e., add the
          Enumservice to the IANA "Enumservice Registrations"
          registry (see also <xref target='Location'></xref>).
          </t>

          <t>
     IANA must only add Enumservices to the Registry, if the experts have
     (conditionally) approved the corresponding Enumservice Specification.
     IANA should attempt to resolve possible conflicts arising
     from this together with the experts. In case there are substantial
     changes between the (conditionally) approved and the to be published
     version, IANA may reject the request after consulting the experts.
</t>
          
          <t>IANA must ensure that any further substantial changes the
          Enumservice Specification might undergo before final RFC
          publication are approved by the experts.</t>

          <t>Note: Clearly editorial changes (such as typos) or minor
          changes in purely editorial sections (such as Authors'

     together with the experts.  In case there are substantial changes
     between the approved and the published version, IANA may reject the
     request after consulting the experts.

      <section anchor='ChangeControl' title='Change Control'>
       
        <t>Change control of any Enumservice registrations is done
        by "Specification Required", 
        which implies the use of a Designated Expert, according to
        <xref target='RFC5226'/>. Updates of Enumservice
        Specifications MUST comply with the requirements described in
        this document. Updates are handled the same way as
        initial Enumservice registrations.
        </t>

        <t>Authorized Change Controllers are the experts and the
        IESG.</t>
        
        <t>Enumservice registrations must not be deleted. An
        Enumservice that is believed to be no longer appropriate for use
        can be declared deprecated by publication of a new
        Enumservice Specification, changing the Enumservice &lt;usage&gt; element
        (Intended Usage) to "DEPRECATED"; such Enumservices will be
        clearly marked in the lists published by IANA.
        As obsoletions are updates, they are also handled the same
        way as initial Enumservice registrations. Alternatively,
        Enumservices may be declared deprecated by an IESG action.
        </t>

      </section>


      <section anchor='Restrictions' title='Restrictions'>

        <t>As stated in <xref target='NamingReq'/>, a "-" (dash)
        MUST NOT be used as the first nor as the second
        nor as the last character of
        a Type or a Subtype. Furthermore, Type or Subtype of
        any Enumservice MUST NOT be set to, nor start with, "E2U".
        Any Enumservice
        registration requests not following these restrictions must be
        rejected by IANA, and the Expert Review process should not
        be initiated.
        </t>

        <t><xref target='enumServiceReg'/> contains examples for
        Enumservice registrations. Therefore, IANA must not register
        an Enumservice with Type or Subtype set to "foo", "bar", or
        "sbar", unless the experts explicitly confirm an exception.

      <t>In the third IANA Registration Template example above, the "voicemsg"
Enumservice is used. This Enumservice actually has several Subtypes, and one of
those is shown in the example.  For each Subtype, an individual Registration
Template must be submitted to IANA, so that an Enumservice with several
Subtypes will have several corresponding IANA Registration Templates.
This is to avoid any
      ambiguity of the relation between &lt;subtype&gt; and
      &lt;urischeme&gt; elements.

    <vspace blankLines='1'/>
    <list style='symbols'>

       <t>While RFC 3761 required "Standards track or Experimental"
          RFCs for an Enumservice to be registered, this document
          mandates "Specification Required", which implies the use of
          a Designated Expert.</t>
 
      <vspace blankLines='1'/>
 
       <t>This document defines the classification of Enumservices.
          The IANA Registration Template has been complemented to
          contain a &lt;class&gt; element (Enumservice Class).
       </t>

      <vspace blankLines='1'/>
 
       <t>A new element &lt;registrationdocs&gt; (Enumservice
          Specification) has been added to the IANA Registration
          Template.
       </t>

       <vspace blankLines='1'/>

       <t>The former field "Any other information that the author
          deems interesting" of the IANA Registration Template turned
          into the &lt;additionalinfo&gt; element (Further Information).
       </t>

       <vspace blankLines='1'/>

       <t>The Enumservice "Name" field has been removed from the IANA
          Registration Template.
       </t>

       <vspace blankLines='1'/>

       <t>The Registration Template is now a chunk of XML data, 
       reflecting IANA's recent work to convert registries to XML.
