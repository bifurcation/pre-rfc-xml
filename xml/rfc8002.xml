    <t>
 
    The Certificate (CERT) parameter is a container for digital certificates.
It is used for carrying these certificates in Host Identity Protocol (HIP)
control packets. This document specifies the certificate parameter and the
error signaling in case of a failed verification. Additionally, this document
specifies the representations of Host Identity Tags (HITs) in X.509 version 3 (v3).
    </t>

    <t>
    The concrete use cases of certificates, including how certificates are
    obtained and requested and which actions are taken upon successful
    or failed verification, are specific to the scenario in which the
    certificates are used. Hence, the definition of these
    scenario-specific aspects is left to the documents that use the
    CERT parameter.
    </t>

    <t>
      This document updates RFC 7401 and obsoletes RFC 6253.

    <t>
    
      Digital certificates bind pieces of information to a public
      key by means of a digital signature and thus enable the
      holder of a private key to generate cryptographically
      verifiable statements. The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) <xref
      target="RFC7401" /> defines a new cryptographic namespace based
      on asymmetric cryptography. The identity of each host is
      derived from a public key, allowing hosts to digitally sign
      data and issue certificates with their private key. This
      document specifies the CERT parameter, which is used to
      transmit digital certificates in HIP. It fills the placeholder
      specified in Section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC7401" /> and thus
      updates <xref target="RFC7401" />.

  <section anchor="sec:cert" title="CERT Parameter">

    <t> The CERT parameter is a container for certain types of
    digital certificates. It does not specify any certificate
    semantics. However, it defines supplementary parameters that help
    HIP hosts to transmit semantically grouped CERT parameters in a
    more systematic way. The specific use of the CERT parameter for
    different use cases is intentionally not discussed in this
    document. Hence,
    the use of the CERT parameter will be defined in the documents
    that use the CERT parameter.</t>

    <t>The CERT parameter is covered and protected, when present, by the HIP
    SIGNATURE field and is a non-critical parameter.</t>

    <t> The CERT parameter can be used in all HIP packets. However,
    using it in the first Initiator (I1) packet is NOT RECOMMENDED because it can
    increase the processing times of I1s, which can be problematic
    when processing storms of I1s. Each HIP control packet MAY
    contain multiple CERT parameters, each carrying one certificate. 
    These parameters MAY be related
    or unrelated. Related certificates are managed in CERT groups. A
    CERT group specifies a group of related CERT parameters that
    SHOULD be interpreted in a certain order (e.g., for expressing
    certificate chains). Ungrouped certificates
    exhibit a unique CERT group field and set the CERT count to 1.
    CERT parameters with the same group number in the CERT group
    field indicate a logical grouping.  The CERT count field
    indicates the number of CERT parameters in the group.  </t>

    <t> CERT parameters that belong to the same CERT group MAY be
    contained in multiple sequential HIP control packets. This is
    indicated by a higher CERT count than the amount of CERT
    parameters with matching CERT group fields in a HIP control
    packet. The CERT parameters MUST be placed in ascending order,
    within a HIP control packet, according to their CERT group field.
    CERT groups MAY only span multiple packets if the CERT group does
    not fit the packet. A HIP packet MUST NOT contain more than one
    incomplete CERT group that continues in the next HIP control
    packet.  </t>

    <t>The CERT ID acts as a sequence number to identify the
    certificates in a CERT group. The numbers in the CERT ID field
    MUST start from 1 up to CERT count. </t>

    <t>The CERT group and CERT ID namespaces are managed locally by
    each host that sends CERT parameters in HIP control packets.</t>

    The next sections outline the use of HITs in
    X.509 v3. X.509 v3 certificates and the
    handling procedures are defined in <xref target="RFC5280" />. The
    wire format for X.509 v3 is the Distinguished Encoding Rules format as
    defined in <xref target="X.690" />.
    </t>

    <t>Hash and Uniform Resource Locator (URL) encoding (3) is
    used as defined in Section 3.6 of <xref target="RFC7296" />. Using
    hash and URL encodings result in smaller HIP control packets than
    by including the certificate(s) but requires the receiver to
    resolve the URL or check a local cache against the hash.</t>
 
    <t>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) URL encoding (5) 
    is used as defined in
    <xref target="RFC4516"/>. Using LDAP URL encoding results in
    smaller HIP control packets but requires the receiver to retrieve
    the certificate or check a local cache against the URL.</t>

    <t>Distinguished Name (DN) encoding (7) is represented by
   the string representation of the certificate's subject DN as
   defined in <xref target="RFC4514"/>.  Using the DN encoding results
   in smaller HIP control packets but requires the receiver to
   retrieve the certificate or check a local cache against the DN.

 <t>
   If needed, HITs can represent an issuer, a subject, or both in
   X.509 v3.  HITs are represented as IPv6 addresses as defined in
   <xref target="RFC7343" />.  When the Host Identifier (HI) is used to sign the
   certificate, the respective HIT SHOULD be placed into the Issuer
   Alternative Name (IAN) extension using the GeneralName form iPAddress
   as defined in <xref target="RFC5280" />.  When the certificate is issued for a HIP
   host, identified by a HIT and an HI, the respective HIT SHOULD be placed
   into the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension using the
   GeneralName form iPAddress, and the full HI is presented as the
   subject's public key info as defined in <xref target="RFC5280" />.
  </t>
  <t> The following examples illustrate how HITs are presented as
    the issuer and subject in the X.509 v3 extension
    alternative names.</t>

    certificate with HIP content.

  </t>

  <t>
    As another example, consider a managed Public Key Infrastructure
    (PKI) environment in which the peers have certificates that are
    anchored in (potentially different) managed trust chains.  In this
    scenario, the certificates issued to HIP hosts are signed by
    intermediate Certification Authorities (CAs) up to a root CA.  In
    this example, the managed PKI environment is neither HIP aware
    nor can it be configured to compute HITs and include them in the
    certificates.
  </t>

  <t>
    When HIP communications are established, the HIP hosts not only
    need to send their identity certificates (or pointers to their
    certificates) but also the chain of intermediate CAs (or pointers
    to the CAs) up to the root CA, or to a CA that is trusted by the
    remote peer.  This chain of certificates SHOULD be sent in a CERT
    group as specified in <xref target="sec:cert" />.  The HIP peers
    validate each other's certificates and compute peer HITs based on
    the certificate public keys.

  <section anchor="sec:revocation" title="Revocation of Certificates">

    <t> Revocation of X.509 v3 certificates is handled as defined in
    Section 5 of <xref target="RFC5280" /> with two exceptions. First, any HIP certificate serial number that appears on the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is treated as invalid regardless of the reason code. Second, the certificateHold is not supported.

  <section anchor="sec:signaling" title="Error Signaling">

    <t> If the Initiator does not send all the certificates that the

    sending a HIP NOTIFY message with NOTIFICATION parameter error
    type CREDENTIALS_REQUIRED.

    <t>If the verification of a certificate fails, a verifier MAY

  <section anchor="sec:iana" title="IANA Considerations">

    <t>This document defines the CERT parameter for HIP <xref target="RFC7401" />. The CERT parameter type
    number (768) is defined in <xref target="RFC7401" />.</t>

   <t>The CERT parameter has an 8-bit unsigned integer field for
   different certificate types, for which IANA has created and
   maintains a subregistry entitled "HIP Certificate Types" under
   "Host Identity Protocol (HIP) Parameters".  Values for
   the "HIP Certificate Types" registry are given in <xref target="sec:cert" />. 
   New values for the Certificate types from the unassigned space are
   assigned through IETF Review.</t>

   types for the "NOTIFY Message Types" subregistry under "Host Identity
   Protocol (HIP) Parameters".

  <section anchor="sec:security" title="Security Considerations">

   <t>Certificate grouping allows the certificates to be sent in multiple
   consecutive packets.  This might allow similar attacks, as IP-layer
   fragmentation allows, for example, the sending of fragments in the
   wrong order and skipping some fragments to delay or stall packet
   processing by the victim in order to use resources (e.g., CPU or
   memory).  Hence, hosts SHOULD implement mechanisms to discard
   certificate groups with outstanding certificates if state space is
   scarce.</t>


   <t>Although the CERT parameter is allowed in the I1 packet, it is NOT RECOMMENDED because it can increase the processing times of I1s, which can be problematic when processing storms of I1s. Furthermore, the Initiator has to take into consideration that the Responder can drop the CERT parameter in I1 without processing the parameter.</t>



    <t>Checking of the URL and LDAP entries might allow denial-of-service
    (DoS) attacks, where the target host may be subjected to bogus work.</t>
