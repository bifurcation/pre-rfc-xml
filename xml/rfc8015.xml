    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines an RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report
      (XR) block that allows the reporting of burst/gap discard metrics
      independently of the burst/gap loss metrics for use in a range
      of RTP applications.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <section title="Independent Burst/Gap Discard Metrics Block">
        <t>This document defines a new block type that extends the metrics defined
        in <xref target="RFC7003"></xref>. The new block type reports the proportion
        of packets discarded in a burst by the de-jitter buffer at the receiver.
        The number of packets discarded depends on the de-jitter buffer algorithm
        implemented by the endpoint.</t>

        <t>The new report block defined in this document is different from
        the one defined in <xref target="RFC7003"></xref>. The metrics in
        <xref target="RFC7003"></xref> depend on the metrics in the
        burst/gap loss metric defined in <xref target="RFC6958"></xref>.
        Consequently, an endpoint that sends a Burst/Gap Discard Metrics Block 
        <xref target="RFC7003"></xref> also needs to send a Burst/Gap Loss 
        Metrics Block <xref target="RFC6958"></xref>.
        The combined usage is useful when an endpoint observes correlated packet
        losses and discard. However, when the burst of packet losses and discards
        do not occur simultaneously, the application could prefer to send a concise report
        block that just reports the burst/gap of discarded packets. The report
        block in this document provides the complete information and does not require
        additional report blocks. That is, this block reports the total number of
        packets discarded, the total burst duration, and the total number of
	bursts. All of these metrics are missing in <xref target="RFC7003"></xref>.</t>

        <t>This block provides information on transient network issues. Burst/gap
        metrics are typically used in cumulative reports; however, they can also
        be used in interval reports (see the Interval Metric flag in
        <xref target="fields"/>). The variation in the number of packet discards in a burst
        affects the user experience. Based on the metrics reported in the block,
        the sending endpoint can change the packetization interval, vary the bitrate, etc.
        The report can additionally be used for diagnostics <xref target="RFC6792"/>.
        The metric belongs to the class of transport-related end-system
        metrics defined in <xref target="RFC6792"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The definitions of "burst", "gap", "loss", and "discard" are consistent with
        the definitions in <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>. To accommodate a
        range of de-jitter buffer algorithms and packet discard logic that can be
        used by implementers, the method used to distinguish between bursts
        and gaps uses an equivalent method to that defined in Section
        4.7.2 of <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>. Note that reporting the
        specific de-jitter buffer algorithm and/or the packet discard logic is out
        of the scope of this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="RTCP and RTCP Extended Reports">
        <t>The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in <xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref>. <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> defined an
        extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended Report (XR).
        This document defines a new Extended Report block for use with <xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Performance Metrics Framework">
        <t>The Performance Metrics Framework <xref target="RFC6390"></xref>
        provides guidance on the definition and specification of performance
        metrics. The RTP Monitoring Framework <xref
        target="RFC6792"></xref> provides guidelines for reporting the block format
        using RTCP XR. The metrics block described in this document is in
        accordance with the guidelines in <xref target="RFC6390"></xref> and
        <xref target="RFC6792"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="apply" title="Applicability">
        <t>These metrics are applicable to a range of RTP applications that
        contain de-jitter buffers at the
        receiver to smooth variation in packet-arrival time and don't
        use stream repair means, e.g., Forward Error Correction (FEC) <xref
        target="FLEX_FEC"></xref> and/or retransmission <xref
        target="RFC4588"></xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

        <t>In addition, the following terms are defined:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Received, Lost, and Discarded"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />A packet is regarded as "lost" if it fails to
            arrive within an implementation-specific time window. A packet
            that arrives within this time window but is too early to be
            played out, too late to be played out, or thrown away before
            playout due to packet duplication or redundancy is be recorded
            as "discarded". A packet SHALL NOT be regarded as "discarded" if it
            arrives within this time window but is dropped during decoding by
            some higher-layer decoder, e.g., due to a decoding error. Each packet
            is classified as one of "received" (or "OK"), "discarded", or "lost".
            The metric "cumulative number of packets lost" defined in <xref
            target="RFC3550"></xref> reports a count of packets lost from the
            media stream (single synchronization source (SSRC) within a single RTP session).
            Similarly, the metric "number of packets discarded" defined in <xref
            target="RFC7002"></xref> reports a count of packets discarded from
            the media stream (single SSRC within a single RTP session) arriving
            at the receiver. Another metric, defined in <xref
            target="RFC5725"></xref>, is available to report on packets that
            are not recovered by any repair techniques that are in use.
            Note that the term "discard" defined here builds on the "discard"
            definition in <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> but extends the concept
            to take into account packet duplication and reports different
            types of discard counts <xref target="RFC7002"></xref>. </t>

            <t hangText="Bursts and Gaps"><vspace blankLines="1" />The terms
            "burst" and "gap" are used in a manner consistent with that of RTCP XR
            <xref target="RFC3611"/>. RTCP XR views an RTP stream as being divided into
            bursts, which are periods during which the discard rate is high
            enough to cause noticeable quality degradation (generally a discard rate over 5
            percent), and gaps, which are periods during which
            discarded packets are infrequent, and hence quality is generally
            acceptable.</t>
          </list></t>

    </section>


    <section anchor="metrics" title="Independent Burst/Gap Discard Metrics Block">
      <t>Metrics in this block report on burst/gap discard in the stream
      arriving at the RTP system. Measurements of these metrics are made at
      the receiving end of the RTP stream. Instances of this metrics block
      use the synchronization source (SSRC) to refer to the separate auxiliary
      Measurement Information Block <xref target="RFC6776"></xref>, which
      describes measurement periods in use (see <xref target="RFC6776"></xref>, Section 4.2).</t>

      <t>This metrics block relies on the measurement period in the
      Measurement Information Block indicating the span of the report. Senders
      MUST send this block in the same compound RTCP packet as the Measurement
      Information Block. Receivers MUST verify that the measurement period is
      received in the same compound RTCP packet as this metrics block. If not,
      this metrics block MUST be discarded.</t>

    <section title="Considerations for Voice-over-IP Applications">
      <t>This metrics block is applicable to a broad range of RTP
      applications. Where the metric is used with a Voice-over-IP (VoIP)
      application and the stream repair means is not available, the following
      considerations apply.</t>

      <t>RTCP XR views a call as being divided into bursts, which are periods
      during which the discard rate is high enough to cause noticeable call
      quality degradation (generally a discard rate over 5 percent) and gaps,
      which are periods during which discarded packets are infrequent, and
      hence call quality is generally acceptable.</t>

      <t>If voice activity detection is used, the burst/gap duration is
      determined as if silence packets had been sent, i.e., a period of
      silence in excess of Gmin packets will terminate a burst condition.</t>

      <t>The RECOMMENDED value for the threshold Gmin in <xref
      target="RFC3611"></xref> results in a burst being a period of time
      during which the call quality is degraded to a similar extent to a
      typical pulse code modulation (PCM) severely errored second.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="SDP Signaling">
      <t><xref target="RFC3611"/> defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol) <xref
      target="RFC4566"></xref> for signaling the use of XR blocks. XR blocks
      can be used without prior signaling.</t>

      <section title="SDP rtcp-xr Attribute Extension">
        <t>This section augments the SDP <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>
        attribute "rtcp-xr" defined in <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> by
        providing an additional value of "xr-format" to signal the use of the

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration. For
      general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to <xref
      target="RFC3611"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="New RTCP XR Block Type Value">
        <t>This document assigns the block type value 35 in the IANA "RTP
        Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Block Type Registry" to the
        "Independent Burst/Gap Discard Metrics Block".</t>

      </section>

      <section title="New RTCP XR SDP Parameter">
        <t>This document also registers a new parameter "ind-burst-gap-discard" in
        the "RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Session
        Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters Registry".</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This block does not provide per-packet
      statistics, so the risk to confidentiality documented in Section 7,
      paragraph 3 of <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> does not apply. However, 
	  the gap indicated within this block could be used to detect the timing 
	  of other events on the path between the sender and receiver. For example, 
	  a competing multimedia stream might cause a discard burst for the duration 
	  of the stream, allowing the receiver of this block to know when the competing 
	  stream was active. This risk is not a significant threat since the only 
	  information leaked is the timing of the discard, not the cause.</t>
	  
	  <t>Where this is a concern, the implementation SHOULD apply encryption 
	  and authentication to this report block. For example, this can be achieved 
	  by using the Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback (AVPF) profile together 
	  with the Secure RTP profile, as defined in <xref target="RFC3711"></xref>; 
	  an appropriate combination of those two profiles ("SAVPF") is specified in <xref
      target="RFC5124"></xref>. Besides this, it is believed that this RTCP XR block 
	  introduces no new security considerations beyond those described in 
	  <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>.</t>
