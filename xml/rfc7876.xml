    <abstract>
      <t>RFC 6374 defines a protocol for Packet Loss and Delay
      Measurement for MPLS networks (MPLS-PLDM). This document specifies the
      procedures to be used when sending and processing out-of-band MPLS
      performance management Responses over an UDP/IP return path.</t>

    <section anchor="PS" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document describes how
      MPLS-PLDM <xref target="RFC6374"/> out-of-band
      Responses can be delivered to the querier using UDP/IP.</t>

      <t>The use of UDP may be required to support data-path management such
      as passage through firewalls or to provide the necessary multiplexing
      needed in bistatic operation where the querier and the collector are not
      co-located and the collector is gathering the Response information for a
      number of responders. In a highly scaled system, some MPLS-PLDM sessions
      may be off-loaded to a specific node within the distributed system that
      comprises the Label Switching Router (LSR) as a whole. In such systems,
      the Response may arrive via any interface in the LSR and needs to be
      forwarded internally to the processor tasked with handling the
      particular MPLS-PLDM measurement. Currently, the MPLS-PLDM protocol does
      not have any mechanism to deliver the PLDM Response message to a
      particular node within a multi-CPU LSR.</t>

      <t>The procedure described in this specification describes how the
      querier requests delivery of the MPLS-PLDM Response over IP to a dynamic
      UDP port. It makes no other changes to the protocol and thus does not
      affect the case where the Response is delivered over an MPLS Associated
      Channel <xref target="RFC5586"/>.</t>

    <section title="Requirements Language">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Solution Overview">
      <t>This document specifies that, unless configured otherwise, if a UDP
      Return Object (URO) is present in an MPLS-PLDM Query, the responder
      SHOULD use the IP address and UDP port in the URO to reply back to the
      querier. The querier MAY include multiple UROs in an MPLS-PLDM Query
      indicating to the responder that an identical Response SHOULD be sent
      to each address-port pair. A responder MAY be designed or configured to
      only transmit a single Response, in which case the Response MUST be sent
      using the parameters specified in the first URO in the Query packet that
      it is able to use (see <xref target="SMPLSR"/>).</t>

      <t>The procedures defined in this document may be applied to both
      unidirectional and bidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs). In this document, the term
      "bidirectional LSP" includes the co-routed bidirectional LSP defined in
      <xref target="RFC3945"/> and the associated bidirectional LSP that is
      constructed from a pair of unidirectional LSPs (one for each direction)
      that are associated with one another at the LSP's ingress/egress points
      <xref target="RFC5654"/>. The mechanisms defined in this document can
      apply to both IP/MPLS and to the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) <xref
      target="RFC5654"/> <xref target="RFC5921"/>.</t>

      <section title="UDP Return Object">
        <t>The format of the UDP Return Object (URO) is as follows:</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork>
    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | URO Type      | Length={6,18} |    UDP-Destination-Port       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   ~                           Address                             ~
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</artwork>
        </figure>
        <t/>

        <t>The Type and Length fields are each 8 bits long. The Length field
        indicates the size in bytes of the remainder of the object (i.e., it is
        the size of the address in bytes plus 2). When the address is IPv4, the
        Length field is thus 6; when the address is IPv6, the Length field
        is thus 18. The Length field therefore acts as both the TLV parsing
        parameter and the address family type indicator.</t>

        <t>The UDP Return Object Type (URO Type) has a value of 131.</t>

        <t>The UDP-Destination-Port is a UDP destination port as specified in
        <xref target="RFC0768"/>.</t>

        <t>The Address is either an IPv4 or an IPv6 address.</t>

        <t>The URO MUST NOT appear in a Response and MUST be ignored if it is 
        found to be present.</t>

        <t>To prevent any ambiguity as to which address the responder needs to
        reply to, an MPLS-PLDM Query message containing a URO MUST NOT 
        include an RFC 6374 Return Address TLV (TLV 1).
        Additionally, the method of
        constructing the return address from the Source Address TLV (TLV 130)
        described in Section 3.5.2 of <xref
        target="RFC6374" /> MUST NOT be used to construct a
        Response to a Query message that contains a URO.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Theory of Operation">
      <t>This document defines the UDP Return Object to enable the MPLS-PLDM
      querier to specify the return path for the MPLS-PLDM reply using UDP/IP
      encapsulation.</t>

      <t>When the MPLS-PLDM Response is requested out-of-band by setting the
      Control Code of the MPLS-PLDM Query to "Out-of-band Response
      Requested", and the URO is present, the responder SHOULD send the
      Response back to querier on the specified destination UDP port at the
      specified destination IP address contained in the URO.</t>

      <t>If the URO is expected but is not present in a Query message and an
      MPLS-PLDM Response is requested out-of-band, the Query message MUST NOT
      be processed further, and if possible, an &ldquo;Error - Invalid
      Message&rdquo; (<xref target="RFC6374"/>, Section 3.1) SHOULD be sent to
      the querier and the operator notified via the management system (see
      <xref target="RxMPLSPMQR"/> for further details).</t>

      <section title="Sending an MPLS-PLDM Query ">
        <t>When sending an MPLS-PLDM Query message, in addition to the rules
        and procedures defined in <xref target="RFC6374"/>, the Control Code
        of the MPLS-PLDM Query MUST be set to "Out-of-band Response
        Requested", and a URO MUST be carried in the MPLS-PLDM Query
        message.</t>

        <t>If the querier uses the UDP port to de-multiplex the Response for a
        different measurement type, there MUST be a different UDP port for
        each measurement type (delay, loss, and delay-loss combined).</t>

        <t>An implementation MAY use multiple UDP ports for the same measurement
        type to direct the Response to the correct management process in the
        LSR.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="RxMPLSPMQR"
               title="Receiving an MPLS-PLDM Query Request">
        <t>The processing of MPLS-PLDM Query messages as defined in <xref
        target="RFC6374"/> applies in this document. In addition, when an
        MPLS-PLDM Query message is received, with the Control Code of the
        MPLS-PLDM Query set to "Out-of-band Response Requested" with a URO
        present, then the responder SHOULD use that IP address and UDP port to
        send an MPLS-PLDM Response back to the querier.</t>

        <t>If an out-of-band Response is requested and the URO is missing, the
        Query SHOULD be dropped in the case of a unidirectional LSP. If the
        TLV is missing on a bidirectional LSP, the Control Code of the
        Response message SHOULD set to 0x1C indicating &ldquo;Error - Invalid
        Message&rdquo; (<xref target="RFC6374"/>, Section 3.1), and the Response
        SHOULD be sent over the reverse LSP. 
   The receipt of such a malformed request SHOULD be
   reported to the operator through the management system, with
   normal precautions taken in respect to the prevention of overload of the
   error-reporting system.
</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="SMPLSR" title="Sending an MPLS-PLDM Response">
        <t>As specified in <xref target="RFC6374"/>, the MPLS-PLDM Response can
        be sent either over the reverse MPLS LSP for a bidirectional LSP or
        over an IP path. It MUST NOT be sent other than in Response to an
        MPLS-PLDM Query message.</t>

        <t>When the requested return path is an IP forwarding path and this
        method is in use, the destination IP address and UDP port are copied
        from the URO. The source IP address and the source UDP port of the
        Response packet are left to the discretion of the responder, subject to the
        normal management and security considerations. If the querier has
        included URO(s) for only one IP address family and a return path of
        that type is not available, then the Query message MUST be discarded,
        and the operator SHOULD be informed of the error through the
        management system using the normal rate-limited approach. If the
        responder is configured to only respond with a single Response, and a
        path using the IP address family in the first URO is not available,
        the responder MAY search the UROs for the first URO specifying a
        return address family for which it does have a path and use the
        parameters in that URO to respond. If the responder is designed or
        configured not to search for a URO that it can respond to, then the
        operator SHOULD be informed of the error through the management system
        using the normal rate-limited approach.</t>

        <t>The packet format for the MPLS-PLDM Response after the UDP header
        is as specified in <xref target="RFC6374"/>. As shown in <xref
        target="encap"/>, the Associated Channel Header (ACH) <xref
        target="RFC5586"/> is not included. The information provided by the
        ACH is not needed since the correct binding between the Query and
        Response messages is achieved through the UDP port and the session
        identifier contained in the RFC 6374 message.</t>

        <t>If the return path is an IP path, only one-way delay or one-way

      <section title="Receiving an MPLS-PLDM Response">

        specified in <xref target="RFC6374"/>.</t>

        <t>If the Response was received over UDP/IP and an out-of-band

    <section title="Congestion Considerations">

      <t>This protocol MUST be run in accordance with the guidance provided in
      <xref target="RFC5405"></xref>. As advised in Section 3.1.2 of
      RFC 5405, operators that wish to run this protocol at rates in excess of
      one packet per three seconds need to ensure that the MPLS path being
      monitored and any IP path that may be used to carry the Response are
      provisioned such that there is a negligible chance of this protocol
      causing congestion. Additionally, if a significant number of Response
      packets are lost, the querier MUST reduce the sending rate to a point
      where there is a negligible chance that this protocol is contributing to
      network congestion. The operator should also take precautions that
      Response packets do not leak out of the network domain being used and
      cause congestion elsewhere. 

      If a default IP address is configured by the
      equipment vendor, this MUST be an address known to contain the Response
      packet within the responder.
      A responder receiving a Query specifying
      this as a return address, and not being configured to expect such a
      return address, SHOULD notify the operator in a suitably rate-limited
      manner. </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Manageability Considerations">
      <t>The manageability considerations described in Section 7 of <xref
      target="RFC6374"/> are applicable to this specification. Additional
      manageability considerations are noted within the elements of procedure
      in this document.</t>

      <t>Nothing in this document precludes the use of a configured UDP/IP
      return path in a deployment in which configuration is preferred to
      signaling. In these circumstances, the URO MAY be omitted from the
      MPLS-PLDM messages.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The MPLS-PLDM system is not intended to be deployed on the public
      Internet. It is intended for deployment in well-managed private and
      service provider networks. The security considerations described in
      Section 8 of <xref target="RFC6374"/> are applicable to this
      specification, and particular attention should be paid to the last two
      paragraphs. Cryptographic measures may be enhanced by the correct
      configuration of access-control lists and firewalls.</t>

      <t>To prevent the use of this protocol as a reflection attack vector,
      the operator should ensure that the IP address in the URO addresses a
      system that is expecting to act as a receiver of PLDM Responses.</t>

      <t>There is no additional exposure of information to pervasive
      monitoring systems observing LSPs that are being monitored.</t>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
