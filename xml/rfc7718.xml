      <t>This memo describes the registries for OWAMP - the One-Way Active
      Measurement Protocol. The registries allow assignment of Mode bit
      positions and OWAMP Command numbers. Per this memo, IANA has
      established the registries for new features, called the OWAMP-Modes
      registry and the OWAMP Control Command Number registry. This memo
      updates RFC 4656.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) <xref
      target="RFC4656"/> was prepared to support measurements of metrics
      specified by the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group in the
      IETF. The Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) <xref
      target="RFC5357"/> is an extension of OWAMP. The TWAMP specification
      gathered wide review as it approached completion, and the by-products
      were several recommendations for new features in TWAMP. As a result, a
      registry of new features was established for TWAMP. However, there were
      no new features proposed for OWAMP until recently <xref
      target="RFC7717"/>.</t>

      <t>This memo establishes the needed registries for OWAMP and updates
      <xref target="RFC4656"/>.</t>

    <section title="Requirements Language">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Purpose and Scope">
      <t>The purpose and scope of this memo is to describe and request the
      establishment of registries for future OWAMP <xref target="RFC4656"/>
      extensions. IANA already administers the "Two-way Active Measurement
      Protocol (TWAMP) Parameters", and this request follows a similar form
      (with one exception identified below).</t>

      <t>This memo also provides the initial contents for the OWAMP
      registries.</t>

    <section title="IANA Considerations for OWAMP-Control Registries">
      <t>The OWAMP-Control protocol coordinates the measurement capability. All
      OWAMP-Control messages follow specifications defined in Section 3 of
      <xref target="RFC4656"/>.</t>

      <section title="Control Command Number Registry">
        <t>IANA has created an OWAMP-Control Command Number
        registry.</t>

        <t>OWAMP-Control Commands follow specifications defined in Section 3.4
        of <xref target="RFC4656"/>.</t>

        <section title="Registry Specification">
          <t>OWAMP-Control Command Numbers are specified in the first octet of
          OWAMP-Control-Client command messages consistent with Section 3 of
          <xref target="RFC4656"/>. There are a maximum of 256 command
          numbers.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Registry Management">
          <t>Because the "OWAMP-Control Command Numbers" registry can contain
          only 256 values, and because OWAMP is an IETF protocol, these
          registries MUST be updated only by "IETF Review" as specified in
          <xref target="RFC5226"/> (an RFC that documents registry use and is
          approved by the IESG).</t>

        <section title="Experimental Numbers">
          <t>One experimental value is currently assigned in the Command
          Numbers Registry, as indicated in the initial contents below.</t>

        <section title="OWAMP-Control Command Numbers Initial Contents">
          <t>OWAMP-Control Commands follows the procedure defined in Section
          3.5 of <xref target="RFC4656"/> and in the remainder of Section 3
	  of that document.</t>

      <section title="OWAMP-Modes">
        <t>IANA has created an OWAMP-Modes registry.</t>

        <section title="Registry Specification">
          <t>OWAMP-Modes are specified in OWAMP Server Greeting messages and
          Set-up Response messages consistent with Section 3.1 of <xref
          target="RFC4656"/>. Modes are currently indicated by setting single
          bits in the 32-bit Modes field. However, more complex encoding may
          be used in the future.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Registry Management">
          <t>Because the "OWAMP-Modes" are based on only 32 bit positions with
          each position conveying a unique feature, and because OWAMP is an
          IETF protocol, these registries MUST be updated only by "IETF
          Review" as specified in <xref target="RFC5226"/> (an RFC that
          documents registry use and is approved by the IESG). IANA SHOULD
          allocate monotonically increasing bit positions when requested.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Experimental Numbers">
          <t>No experimental bit positions are currently assigned in the Modes
          registry, as indicated in the initial contents below.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="OWAMP-Modes Initial Contents">
          <t>OWAMP-Control connection establishment follows the procedure
          defined in Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC4656"/>.</t>

          <t>In the OWAMP-Modes registry, assignments are straightforward on
          the basis of bit positions, and there are no references to values --
          this is a difference from the comparable TWAMP registry (and a topic
          for improvement in the TWAMP-Modes registry that is reconciled in
          <xref target="RFC7717"/>).</t>

          <t>An extension of the OWAMP-Modes is proposed in <xref
          target="RFC7717"/>. With this extension, the complete
          set of OWAMP Mode bit positions are as follows (including one
          reserved bit position):</t>

          <t>In the original OWAMP Modes field, setting bit position 0, 1, or 2
          indicated the security mode of the Control protocol, and the Test
          protocol inherited the same mode (see Section 4 of <xref
          target="RFC4656"/>).</t>

          <t>The value of the Modes field sent by the Server in the
          Server-Greeting message is the bit-wise OR of the modes (bit
          positions) that it is willing to support during this session. Thus,
          the five least significant bits of the 32-bit Modes field are used.
          When no other features are activated, the 27 most significant bits
          MUST be zero. A Control-Client conforming to <xref
          target="RFC4656"/> MAY ignore the values in the 29 most significant
          bits of the Modes field, or it MAY support features that are
          communicated in other bit positions, such as the IKEv2-derived
          Shared Secret Key extension <xref
          target="RFC7717"/>.</t>

          <t>OWAMP and TWAMP registries for Modes may grow to contain
          different features and functions due to the inherent differences in
          one-way and two-way measurement configurations and the metrics they
          measure. No attempt will be made to coordinate them unnecessarily,
          except for the Reserved bit position 3 above. This is available for
          assignment if a mixed security mode similar to <xref
          target="RFC5618"> </xref> is defined for OWAMP; it would allow
          alignment with the comparable TWAMP feature.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>As this memo simply documents the creation of OWAMP registries, it
      presents no new security or privacy issues for the Internet.</t>

      <t>The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
      live networks are relevant here as well. See <xref target="RFC4656"/>
      and <xref target="RFC5357"/>.</t>

      <t>Privacy considerations for measurement systems, particularly when
      Internet users participate in the tests in some way, are described in
