		<abstract>
			<t>This document provides guidance on IPv6 deployment in Internet
				Exchange Points (IXPs). It includes information regarding the switch
				fabric configuration, the addressing plan and general organizational
				tasks that need to be performed. IXPs are mainly a Layer 2
				infrastructure, and, in many cases, the best recommendations suggest
				that the IPv6 data, control, and management plane should not be
				handled differently than in IPv4.</t>
		</abstract>
	</front>
	<middle>
		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>Most Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) work at the Layer 2 level,
				making the adoption of IPv6 an easy task. However, IXPs normally
				implement additional services such as statistics, route servers,
				looking glasses, and broadcast controls that may be impacted by the
				implementation of IPv6. This document clarifies the impact of IPv6
				on a new or an existing IXP. The document assumes an Ethernet switch
				fabric, although other Layer 2 configurations could be deployed.</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Switch Fabric Configuration">
			<t>
				An Ethernet-based IXP switch fabric implements IPv6 over Ethernet as
				described in
				<xref target="RFC2464"></xref>
				. Therefore, the switching of IPv6 traffic happens in the same way
				as in IPv4. However, some management functions (such as switch management, SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
				<xref target="RFC3411"></xref>
				support, or flow analysis exportation)  may require IPv6 as an underlying layer, and this should be assessed
				by the IXP operator.
			</t>
			<t>There are two common configurations of IXP switch ports to support
				IPv6:</t>
			<t>
				<list style='numbers'>
					<t>dual-stack LAN (Local Area Network): when both IPv4 and IPv6
						traffic share a common LAN. No extra configuration is required in
						the switch.</t>
					<t>independent VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)<xref target="IEEE.P802-1Q.1998"></xref>: when an IXP
						logically separates IPv4 and IPv6 traffic in different VLANs.</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>In both configurations, IPv6 and IPv4 traffic can either share a
				common physical port or use independent physical ports. The use of
				independent ports can be more costly in both capital expenses (as
				new ports are needed) and operational expenses.</t>
			<t>When using the same physical port for both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic,
				some changes may be needed at the participants&apos; interfaces&apos;
				configurations.
<!--[rfced] Should the above be made:

...at the participants' interface configurations.

or 

...at the participants' interfaces' configurations.

or is there another way to rephrase? 

-->
 If the IXP implements the &quot;dual-stack
				configuration&quot;, IXP&apos;s participants will configure dual-stack
				interfaces. On the other hand, if the IXP implements the
				&quot;independent VLAN configuration&quot;, IXP participants are
				required to pass one additional VLAN tag across the interconnection.
				In this case, if the IXP did not originally use VLAN tagging, VLAN
				tagging should be established and the previously configured LAN may continue untagged
				as a "native VLAN" or be transitioned to a tagged VLAN. The
				&quot;independent VLAN&quot; configuration provides a logical
				separation of IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, simplifying separate
				statistical analysis for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. Conversely, the
				"dual-stack" configuration (when performing separate statistical
				analysis for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic) would require the use of flow
				techniques such as IPFIX (IP Flow Information Export) [RFC5101] to classify traffic based on the
				different Ethertypes (0x0800 for IPv4, 0x0806 for ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), and 0x86DD
				for IPv6).</t>
			<t>The only technical requirement for IPv6 referring link MTUs is
				that they need to be greater than or equal to 1280 octets [RFC2460].
				The MTU size for every LAN in an IXP should be well known by all its
				participants.</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Addressing Plan" anchor="sec_addr">
			<t>
				Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) have specific address policies
				to assign Provider Independent (PI) IPv6 addresses to IXPs. Those
				allocations are usually /48 or shorter prefixes [RIR_IXP_POLICIES].
				Depending on the country and region of operation, address
				assignments may be made by NIRs (National Internet Registries).
				Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses (<xref target="RFC4193"></xref>) are normally not used in an IXP LAN as global reverse DNS
				resolution and whois services are required.
			</t>

			<t>
				IXPs will normally use manual address configuration. The manual
				configuration of IPv6 addresses allows IXP participants to replace
				network interfaces with no need to reconfigure Border Gateway
				Protocol (BGP) sessions&apos; information, and it also facilitates
				management tasks. The IPv6 Addressing Architecture
				<xref target="RFC4291"></xref>
				requires that interface identifiers are 64 bits in size for prefixes
				not starting with binary 000, resulting in a maximum prefix length of
				/64. Longer prefix lengths up to /127 have been used operationally.
				If prefix lengths longer than 64 bits are chosen, the implications
				described in <xref target="RFC3627"></xref> need to be considered. A /48 prefix allows
				the addressing of 65536 /64 LANs.
			</t>

			<t>When selecting the use of static Interface Identifiers (IIDs),
				there are different options on how to fill its 64 bits (or 16
				hexadecimal characters). A non-exhaustive list of possible IID
				selection mechanisms is the following:</t>

			<t>
				<list style='numbers'>
					<t>Some
						IXPs like to include the decimal encoding of each participant&apos;s ASN (Autonomous System Number)
						 inside its correspondent IPv6 address. The ASN decimal number is used
						as the BCD (binary code decimal) encoding of the upper part of the
						IID such as shown in this example:
						<list style='symbols'>
							<t>IXP LAN prefix: 2001:db8::/64</t>
							<t>ASN: 64496</t>
							<t>IPv6 Address: 2001:db8:0000:0000:0000:0006:4496:0001/64 or its
								equivalent representation 2001:db8::6:4496:1/64</t>
						</list>In this example, we are right-justifying the participant&apos;s ASN
						number from the 112nd bit. Remember that 32-bit ASNs require a
						maximum of 10 characters. With this example, up to 2^16 IPv6
						addresses can be configured per ASN.
					</t>

					<t>
						Although BCD encoding is more "human-readable", some IXPs prefer
						to use the hexadecimal encoding of the ASNs number as the upper
						part of the IID as follow:
						<list style='symbols'>
							<t>IXP LAN prefix: 2001:db8::/64</t>
							<t>ASN: 64496 (DEC) or fbf0 (HEX)</t>
							<t>IPv6 Address: 2001:db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:fbf0:0001/64 or its
								equivalent representation 2001:db8::fbf0:1/64</t>
						</list>
						In this case, a maximum of 8 characters will be needed to represent
						32-bit ASNs.
					</t>

					<t>A
						third scheme for statically assigning IPv6 addresses on an IXP LAN
						could be to relate some portions of a participant&apos;s IPv6
						address to its IPv4 address. In the following example, the last
						four decimals of the IPv4 address are copied to the last
						hexadecimals of the IPv6 address, using the decimal number as the
						BCD encoding for the last three characters of the IID such as in
						the following example:
						<list style='symbols'>
							<t>IXP LAN prefix: 2001:db8::/64</t>
							<t>IPv4 Address: 192.0.2.123/23</t>
							<t>IPv6 Address: 2001:db8:2::123/64</t>
						</list>
					</t>

					<t>A fourth approach might be based on the IXPs ID for that
						participant.</t>
				</list>
			</t>

			<t>
				IPv6 prefixes for IXP LANs are typically publicly well known and
				taken from dedicated IPv6 blocks for IXP assignments reserved for
				this purpose by the different RIRs. These blocks are usually only
				meant for addressing the exchange fabric, and may be filtered out by
				DFZ (Default Free Zone) operators. When considering the routing of
				the IXP LANs two options are identified:
				<list style='symbols'>
					<t>IXPs may decide that LANs should not to be globally routed in
						order to limit the possible origins of a Denial-of-Service (DoS)
						attack to its participants' AS (Autonomous System) boundaries. In this configuration,
						participants may route these prefixes inside their networks (e.g., using BGP no-export communities or routing the IXP LANs within the
						participants' IGP) to perform fault management. Using this
						configuration, the monitoring of the IXP LANs from outside of its
						participants' AS boundaries is not possible.</t>
					<t>IXP may decide that LANs should (attempt to) be globally
						routed. In this case, IXP LANs monitoring from outside its
						participants' AS boundaries may be possible, but the IXP LANs will
						be vulnerable to DoS from outside of those boundaries.</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>Additionally, possible IXP external services (such as DNS, web
				pages, FTP servers) need to be globally routed. These should be
				addressed from separate address blocks, either from upstream
				providers' address space or separate independent assignments.
				Strict prefix length filtering could be a reason for requesting more
				than one /48 assignment from a RIR (i.e., requesting one /48
				assignment for the IXPs LANs that may not be globally routed and a
				different, non-IXP /48 assignment for the IXP external services that
				will be globally routed).</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Multicast IPv6" anchor="multicast">
			<t>There are two elements that need to be evaluated when studying
				IPv6 multicast in an IXP: multicast support for neighbor discovery
				and multicast peering.</t>
			<section title="Multicast Support and Monitoring for Neighbor Discovery at an IXP">
				<t>
					IXPs typically control broadcast traffic across the switching
					fabric in order to avoid broadcast storms by only allowing limited
					ARP
					<xref target="RFC0826"></xref>
					traffic for address resolution. In IPv6 there is not broadcast
					support, but IXPs may intend to control multicast traffic in each LAN
					instead. ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery
					<xref target="RFC4861"></xref>
					implements the following necessary functions in an IXP switching
					fabric: Address Resolution, Neighbor Unreachability Detection, and
					Duplicate Address Detection. In order to perform these functions,
					Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement packets are
					exchanged using the link-local all-nodes multicast address
					(ff02::1) and/or solicited-node multicast addresses
					(ff02:0:0:0:0:1:ff00:0000 to ff02:0:0:0:0:1:ffff:ffff). As
					described in
					<xref target="RFC4861"></xref>,
					routers will initialize their interfaces by joining their
					solicited-node multicast addresses using either Multicast Listener
					Discovery (MLD)
					<xref target="RFC2710"></xref>
					or MLDv2
					<xref target="RFC3810"></xref>. 
 
MLD messages may be sent to the corresponding group address:
					ff02::2 (MLD) or ff02::16 (MLDv2). Depending on the addressing plan
					selected by the IXP, each solicited-node multicast group may be
					shared by a sub-set of participants' conditioned by how the last
					three octets of the addresses are selected. In
					<xref target="sec_addr" />,
					example 1, only participants with ASNs with the same last two
					digits are going to share the same solicited-node multicast group.
				</t>
				<t>
					Similar to the ARP policy, an IXP may limit multicast traffic
					across the switching fabric in order to only allow ICMPv6 Neighbor
					Solicitation, Neighbor Advertisement, and MLD messages. Configuring
					default routes in an IXP LAN without an agreement between the
					parties is normally against IXP policies. ICMPv6 Router
					Advertisement packets should neither be issued nor accepted by
					routers connected to the IXP. Where possible, the IXP operator
					should block link-local RA (Router Advertisement) packets using IPv6 RA-GUARD
					<xref target="V6OPS-RA-GUARD" />
					. If this is not possible, the IXP operator should monitor the
					exchange for rogue Router Advertisement packets as described in
					<xref target="V6OPS-ROGUE-RA" />
					.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="IPv6 Multicast Traffic Exchange at an IXP">
				<t>
					For IPv6 Multicast traffic exchange, an IXP may decide to use
					either the same LAN being used for unicast IPv6 traffic exchange,
					the same LAN being used for IPv4 Multicast traffic exchange, or a
					dedicated LAN for IPv6 Multicast traffic exchange. The reason for
					having a dedicated LAN for multicast is to prevent unwanted
					multicast traffic from reaching participants that do not have multicast
					support. Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)
					<xref target="RFC4601"></xref>
					messages will be sent to the link-local IPv6 'ALL-PIM-ROUTERS'
					multicast group ff02::d in the selected LAN and should be allowed.
					Implementing IPv6 PIM snooping will allow only the participants
					associated with a particular group to receive its multicast traffic.
					BGP reachability information for IPv6 multicast address family
					(SAFI=2) is normally exchanged using MP-BGP (Multi-Protocol BGP)
					<xref target="RFC4760"></xref>
					and is used for Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) lookups performed by
					the IPv6 PIM. If a dedicated LAN is configured for Multicast IPv6
					traffic exchange, reachability information for IPv6 Multicast
					address family should be carried in new BGP sessions. ICMPv6
					Neighbor Discovery should be allowed in the Multicast IPv6 LAN as
					described in the previous paragraph.
				</t>
			</section>
		</section>

		<section title="Reverse DNS">
			<t>The inclusion of PTR records for all addresses assigned to
				participants in the IXP reverse zone under "ip6.arpa" facilitates
				troubleshooting, particularly when using tools such as traceroute.
				If reverse DNS is configured, DNS servers should be reachable over
				IPv6 transport for complete IPv6 support.</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Route-Server">
			<t>IXPs may offer a route-server service, either for Multi-Lateral
				Peering Agreements (MLPA) service, looking-glass service, or
				route-collection service. IPv6 support needs to be added to the BGP
				speaking router. The equipment should be able to transport IPv6
				traffic and to support MP-BGP extensions for
				IPv6 address family ([RFC2545] and [RFC4760]).</t>
			<t>A good practice is that all BGP sessions used to exchange IPv6
				network information are configured using IPv6 data transport. This
				configuration style ensures that both network reachability
				information and generic packet data transport use the same transport
				plane. Because of the size of the IPv6 space, limiting the maximum
				number of IPv6 prefixes in every session should be studied.</t>
			<t>External services should be available for external IPv6 access,
				either by an IPv6 enabled web page or an IPv6 enabled console
				interface.</t>
		</section>

		<section title="External and Internal support">
			<t>Some external services that need to have IPv6 support are traffic
				graphics, DNS, FTP, web, route server, and looking glass. Other
				external services such as NTP servers, or SIP Gateways need to be
				evaluated as well. In general, each service that is currently
				accessed through IPv4 or that handle IPv4 addresses should be
				evaluated for IPv6 support.</t>

			<t>Internal services are also important when considering IPv6
				adoption at an IXP. Such services may not deal with IPv6 traffic, but
				may handle IPv6 addresses; that is the case of provisioning systems,
				logging tools and statistics analysis tools. Databases and tools
				should be evaluated for IPv6 support.</t>
		</section>

		<section title="IXP Policies and IPv6">
			<t>IXP policies and contracts should be revised as any mention of IP
				should be clarified if it refers to IPv4, IPv6, or both.</t>
			<t>
				Policies for IPv6 traffic monitoring and filtering may be in place
				as described in <xref target="multicast" />.
			</t>
		</section>


		<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
			<t>This memo includes references to procedures for monitoring and/or avoiding
				particular ICMPv6 traffic at IXPs' LANs. None of these procedures
				prevent Ethernet loops caused by mischief in the LAN. The document
				also mentions how to limit IPv6 DoS attacks to the IXP switch fabric
				by not globally announce the IXP LANs prefix.</t>

<abstract><t>It is particularly easy to experience "rogue" routers on an unsecured link [reference4].  Devices acting as a rogue router may send illegitimate RAs.  Section 6 of SeND [RFC3971] provides a full solution to this problem, by enabling routers certification.  This solution does, however, require all nodes on an L2 network segment to support SeND, as well as it carries some deployment challenges.  End- nodes must be provisioned with certificate anchors.  The solution works better when end-nodes have access to a Certificate Revocation List server, and to a Network Time Protocol server, both typically off-link, which brings some bootstrap issues.  When using IPv6 within a single L2 network segment it is possible and sometimes desirable to enable layer 2 devices to drop rogue RAs before they reach end-nodes.  In order to distinguish valid from rogue RAs, the L2 devices can use a spectrum of criteria, from a static scheme that blocks RAs received on un-trusted ports, or from un-trusted sources, to a more dynamic scheme that uses SeND to challenge RA sources.  This document reviews various techniques applicable on the L2 devices to reduce the threat of rogue RAs.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>When deploying IPv6, whether IPv6-only or dual-stack, routers are configured to send IPv6 Router Advertisements to convey information to nodes that enable them to autoconfigure on the network.  This information includes the implied default router address taken from the observed source address of the Router Advertisement (RA) message, as well as on-link prefix information.  However, unintended misconfigurations by users or administrators, or possibly malicious attacks on the network, may lead to bogus RAs being present, which in turn can cause operational problems for hosts on the network.  In this draft we summarise the scenarios in which rogue RAs may be observed and present a list of possible solutions to the problem.  We focus on the unintended causes of rogue RAs in the text.  The goal of this text is to be Informational, and as such to present a framework around which solutions can be proposed and discussed.</t></abstract>
