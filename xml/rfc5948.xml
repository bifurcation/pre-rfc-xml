<t>
IEEE 802.16 is an air interface specification for wireless broadband access.
IEEE 802.16 has specified multiple service-specific Convergence Sublayers
for transmitting upper-layer protocols.  The Packet CS (Packet Convergence
Sublayer) is used for the transport
of all packet-based protocols such as the Internet Protocol (IP) and IEEE
802.3 (Ethernet).  The IP-specific part of the Packet CS enables the transport
of IPv4 packets directly over the IEEE 802.16 Media Access Control (MAC) layer.
</t>

<t>
This document specifies the frame format, the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU),
and the address assignment procedures for transmitting IPv4 packets over the IP-specific 
part of the Packet Convergence Sublayer of IEEE 802.16.

<section title="Introduction">

<t>
IEEE 802.16 <xref target="IEEE802_16" pageno="false" format="default"/> is a 
connection-oriented access technology for the last mile. 

 The IEEE 802.16 
specification includes the Physical (PHY) and Media Access Control
(MAC) layers.  The MAC layer includes various
Convergence Sublayers (CSs) for transmitting higher-layer packets, including
IPv4 packets <xref target="IEEE802_16" />.
</t>

<t>
 The scope of this specification is limited to the operation of IPv4
 over the IP-specific part of the Packet CS (referred to as "IPv4 CS")
 for hosts served by a network that utilizes the IEEE Std 802.16 air interface.
</t>

<t>
This document specifies a method for encapsulating and transmitting
IPv4 <xref target='RFC0791'/> packets over the IPv4 CS of IEEE 802.16.  This 
document also specifies the MTU and address assignment method for hosts 
using IPv4 CS.

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
    "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

<section title="Terminology">

<t>
    <list style="symbols">
    <t>
    Mobile Station (MS) -- The term "MS" is used to refer to
    an IP host.
    This usage is more informal than that in IEEE 802.16,
    in which "MS" refers to the interface implementing the IEEE 802.16 MAC
    and PHY layers and not to the entire host.
    </t>

   <t>
   Last mile -- The term "last mile" is used to refer to the final leg of
   delivering connectivity from a communications provider to a customer.

<t>
    Other terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
<xref target='RFC5154' />.
</t>

</section>


<section title="Typical Network Architecture for IPv4 over IEEE 802.16">
<t>
The network architecture follows what is described in <xref target='RFC5154' /> and 
<xref target='RFC5121' />.
Namely, each MS is attached
to an Access Router (AR) through a Base Station (BS), a Layer 2 (L2) entity
(from the perspective of the IPv4 link between the MS and
the AR).
</t>

<t>
For further information on the typical network architecture, see <xref
target='RFC5121' />, Section 5.
</t>

  <section title ="IEEE 802.16 IPv4 Convergence Sublayer Support">
   
    <t>

   As described in <xref target="IEEE802_16"/>, the IP-specific part of the Packet CS
   allows the transmission of either IPv4 or IPv6 payloads. 
   In this document, we are focusing on IPv4 over the Packet Convergence
   Sublayer.
   </t>

    <t>
    For further information on the IEEE 802.16 Convergence Sublayer and encapsulation 
    of IP packets, see Section 4 of <xref target='RFC5121' /> and <xref target="IEEE802_16"/>.

  </t>
  </section>

</section>

<section title="IPv4 CS Link in 802.16 Networks">
<t>
   In 802.16, the transport connection between an MS and a BS is used to
   transport user data, i.e., IPv4 packets in this case.  A transport
   connection is represented by a service flow, and multiple transport
   connections can exist between an MS and a BS.
</t>

<t>
   When an AR and a BS are co-located, the collection of transport
   connections to an MS is defined as a single IPv4 link.  When an AR and a
   BS are separated, it is recommended that a tunnel be established
   between the AR and a BS whose granularity is no greater than "per MS"
   or "per service flow".  (An MS can have multiple service flows, which
   are identified by a service flow ID.)  Then the tunnel(s) for an MS,
   in combination with the MS's transport connections, forms a single
   point-to-point IPv4 link.
</t>

  <t>
   Each host belongs to a different IPv4 link and is assigned a unique IPv4
   address, similar to the recommendations discussed in "Analysis of IPv6 Link
   Models for IEEE 802.16 Based Networks" (<xref target='RFC4968'/>).

</t>

 <section title="IPv4 CS Link Establishment">
 <t>
  In order to enable the sending and receiving of IPv4 packets between
   the MS and the AR, the link between the MS and the AR via the BS
   needs to be established.  This section explains the link
   establishment procedure, as described in Section 6.2 of
   <xref target='RFC5121' />.
   Steps&nbsp;1-4 are the same as those indicated in Section 6.2 of
   <xref target='RFC5121' />.  In step 5,
   support for IPv4 is indicated.  In step 6, a service flow is created that
   can be used for exchanging IP-layer signaling messages, e.g., address
   assignment procedures using DHCP.
   </t>
   </section>
<section title="Frame Format for IPv4 Packets">
<t>
IPv4 packets are transmitted in Generic IEEE 802.16 MAC frames in the data payloads of the 
802.16 PDU (see Section 3.2 of <xref target='RFC5154'/>).
</t>

<section title="Maximum Transmission Unit">

<t>
The MTU value for IPv4 packets on an IEEE 802.16 link is 
configurable (e.g., see the end of this section for some possible mechanisms).
The default MTU for IPv4 packets over an IEEE 802.16
link SHOULD be 1500 octets.  Given the possibility for "in-the-network"
tunneling, supporting this MTU at the end hosts has implications on
the underlying network, for example, as discussed in <xref target='RFC4459' />.
</t>

<t>
Per <xref target='RFC5121' />, Section 6.3, the IP MTU can vary
to be larger or smaller than 1500 octets.
</t>

<t>
If an MS transmits 1500-octet packets in a deployment with a smaller MTU, 
packets from the MS may be dropped at the link layer silently.
Unlike IPv6, in which departures
from the default MTU are readily advertised via the MTU option in 
Neighbor Discovery (via router advertisement), there is no similarly reliable mechanism in IPv4,
as the legacy IPv4 client implementations do not determine the link MTU by 
default before sending packets.  Even though there is a DHCP option 
to accomplish this, DHCP servers are required
to provide the MTU information only when requested. 
</t>

<t>
Discovery and configuration of the proper link MTU value ensures adequate
usage of the network bandwidth and resources.
Accordingly, deployments should avoid packet loss
due to a mismatch between the default MTU
and the configured link MTUs.
</t>

<t>
Some of the mechanisms available for the IPv4 CS host to find out the
link's MTU value and mitigate MTU-related issues are:
</t>

<t>


<list style="symbols">

<t>
  Recent revision of 802.16 by the IEEE (see IEEE 802.16-2009
  <xref target="IEEE802_16"/>) to (among other things) allow the provision of the
  Service Data Unit or MAC MTU in the IEEE 802.16 SBC-REQ/SBC-RSP phase,
  such that clients that are compliant with IEEE 802.16 can infer and configure the
  negotiated MTU size for the IPv4 CS link.
  However, the implementation must communicate the negotiated MTU value to
  the IP layer to adjust the IP Maximum Payload Size for proper handling of
  fragmentation.  Note that this method is useful only when the MS is
  directly connected to the BS.
</t>

<t>
   Configuration and negotiation of MTU size at the network layer by using
   the DHCP interface MTU option <xref target='RFC2132'/>.
</t>

</list>
</t>

  <t>
   This document recommends that implementations of IPv4 and 
   IPv4 CS clients SHOULD use the DHCP interface MTU option
   <xref target='RFC2132'/> in order to configure its interface
   MTU accordingly. 

  </t>

   <t>
In the absence of DHCP MTU configuration, the client node (MS) has two
alternatives: 1) use the default MTU (1500 bytes), or 2) determine
the MTU by the methods described in IEEE 802.16-2009
<xref target="IEEE802_16" />.
</t>

  <t>
   Additionally, the clients are encouraged to run Path MTU (PMTU)
   Discovery <xref target="RFC1191" /> or Packetization Layer Path MTU
   Discovery (PLPMTUD) <xref target="RFC4821" />.
   However, the PMTU mechanism has inherent problems of packet
   loss due to ICMP messages not reaching the
   sender and IPv4 routers not fragmenting the packets due to the Don't
   Fragment (DF) bit being
   set in the IP packet.  The above-mentioned path MTU mechanisms will take
   care of the MTU size between the MS and its correspondent node across
   different flavors of convergence layers in the access networks.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Subnet Model and IPv4 Address Assignment">

<t>
The subnet model recommended for IPv4 over IEEE 802.16 using IPv4 CS is based
on the point-to-point link between the MS and the AR <xref target='RFC4968'/>;
hence, each MS shall be assigned an address with a 32-bit prefix length or
subnet mask.  The point-to-point link between the MS and the AR is
achieved using a set of IEEE 802.16 MAC connections (identified by
service flows) and an L2 tunnel (e.g., a Generic Routing
Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel) for each MS between the BS and the AR.
If the AR is co-located with the BS, then the
set of IEEE 802.16 MAC connections between the MS and the BS/AR represent
the point-to-point connection.
</t>

<t>
The "next hop" IP address of the IPv4 CS MS is always the IP address of the
AR, because the MS and the AR are attached via a point-to-point link.
</t>

 <section title="IPv4 Unicast Address Assignment">

<t>
DHCP <xref target='RFC2131'/> SHOULD be used for assigning an IPv4 address
for
the MS.  DHCP messages are transported over the IEEE 802.16 MAC connection
to and from the BS and relayed to the AR.  In case the DHCP server 
does not reside in the AR, the AR SHOULD
implement a DHCP relay agent <xref target='RFC1542'/>. 
</t>

</section>

<section title="Address Resolution Protocol">
<t>
The IPv4 CS does not allow for transmission of Address Resolution Protocol
(ARP) <xref target='RFC0826'/> packets.  Furthermore, 
in a point-to-point link model, address resolution is not needed.
</t>

</section>


<section title="IP Broadcast and Multicast">
<t>
 Multicast or broadcast packets from the MS are delivered to the AR 
 via the BS 
 through the point-to-point link. 

 This specification simply assumes that the broadcast and multicast
 services are provided.  How these services are implemented in an IEEE 802.16 
 Packet CS deployment is out of scope of this document.
</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
This document specifies transmission of IPv4 packets over IEEE 802.16 
networks with the IPv4 Convergence Sublayer and does not introduce any
new vulnerabilities to IPv4 specifications or operation.  The security
of the IEEE 802.16 air interface is the subject of <xref target="IEEE802_16"
pageno="false" format="default"/>.  In addition, the security issues
of the network architecture spanning beyond the IEEE 802.16 Base Stations
is the subject of the documents defining such architectures, such as
the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) network
architecture <xref target="WMF" pageno="false" format="default"/>.

<appendix title="Multiple Convergence Layers -- Impact on Subnet Model">

<t>
Two different MSs using two different Convergence Sublayers (e.g., an MS using
Ethernet CS only and another MS using IPv4 CS only) cannot communicate at the
data link
layer and require interworking at the IP layer.  For this reason, these two nodes
must be configured to be on two different subnets.  For more information,
refer to <xref target='RFC4840'/>.
</t>
</appendix>


<appendix title="Sending and Receiving IPv4 Packets">
<t>
IEEE 802.16 MAC is a point-to-multipoint connection-oriented air interface,
and the process of sending and receiving IPv4 packets is different
from multicast-capable shared-medium technologies like Ethernet.
</t>

<t>
Before any packets are transmitted, an IEEE 802.16 transport connection
must be established.  This connection consists of an IEEE&nbsp;802.16 MAC
transport
connection between the MS and the BS and an L2 tunnel between the BS and the
AR (if these two are not co&nbhy;located).  This
IEEE 802.16 transport connection provides a point-to-point link between
the MS and the AR.  All the packets originating at the MS always reach the AR
before being transmitted to the final destination.
</t>

<t>
IPv4 packets are carried directly in the payload of IEEE 802.16 frames when 
the IPv4 CS is used.  IPv4 CS classifies the packet based on upper-layer 
(IP and transport layers) header fields to place the packet on one of the
available connections identified by the CID.  The classifiers for the IPv4
CS are source and destination IPv4 addresses, source and destination
ports, Type-of-Service, and IP Protocol field.  The CS may employ Packet
Header Suppression (PHS) after the classification.
</t>

<t>
The BS optionally reconstructs the payload header if PHS is in use.
It then tunnels the packet that has been received on a particular MAC
connection to the AR.  Similarly, the packets received on a tunnel 
interface from the AR would be mapped to a particular CID using the IPv4
classification mechanism.
</t>

<t>
The AR performs normal routing for the packets that it receives, processing
them per its forwarding table.  However, the DHCP relay agent in the AR MUST
maintain the tunnel interface on which it receives DHCP requests so that it
can relay the
DHCP responses to the correct MS.  The particular method is out of scope of this specification
as it need not depend on any particularities of IEEE&nbsp;802.16.

</t>
</appendix>


<appendix title="WiMAX IPv4 CS MTU Size">

        <t>
The WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) forum has defined a
network architecture <xref target="WMF"/>.  Furthermore, WiMAX has specified 
IPv4 CS support for transmission of
IPv4 packets between the MS and the BS over the IEEE 802.16 link.  The WiMAX
IPv4 CS and this specification are similar.
 
One significant difference, however, is that the WiMAX
Forum <xref target="WMF"/> has specified the IP MTU as 1400 octets
<xref target="WMF"/> as opposed to 1500 in this specification.

   <t>
Hence, if an IPv4 CS MS configured with an MTU of 1500 octets enters
a WiMAX network, some of the issues mentioned in this specification
may arise.  As mentioned in Section 4.3, the possible mechanisms are not
guaranteed to work.  Furthermore, an IPv4 CS client is not capable of
doing ARP probing to find out the link MTU.  On the other hand, it is
imperative for an MS to know the link MTU size.  In practice, an MS should
be able to sense or deduce the fact that it is operating within a WiMAX
network (e.g., given the WiMAX-specific particularities of the authentication
and network entry procedures), and adjust its MTU size
accordingly.  Even though this method is not perfect, and the potential
for conflict may remain, this document recommends a default MTU of 1500.
This represents the WG's consensus (after much debate) to select the best
value for IEEE 802.16 from the point of view of the IETF, in spite of the
WiMAX Forum's deployment.
