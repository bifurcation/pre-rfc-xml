      <t>
        IANA maintains the "IS-IS TLV Codepoints" registry.  This registry
        documents which TLVs can appear in different types of IS-IS
        Protocol Data Units (PDUs), but does not document which TLVs can be
        found in zero Remaining Lifetime Link State PDUs (LSPs), a.k.a.
        purges.  This document extends the existing registry to record the
        set of TLVs that are permissible in purges and updates the rules
        for generating and processing purges in the presence of
        authentication.  This document updates RFC 3563, RFC 5304,
        and RFC 5310.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The IS-IS <xref target='ISO-10589'/> routing protocol maintains a
        link state database of the topology of its routing domain by
        flooding a set of Link State Protocol Data Units (LSPs).  When the
        protocol no longer needs the information stored in an LSP, it uses
        the purge mechanism to cause the Intermediate Systems (ISs) in its
        domain to discard the information contained in the LSP.  The
        process for generating purges can be found in Section 7.3.16.4 of
        <xref target='ISO-10589'/>.  This process retains only the LSP
        header, discarding any TLVs that had been carried within the LSP.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        Subsequent enhancements to IS-IS, such as <xref target='RFC5304'/>
        <xref target='RFC5310'/>, amend the process of generating a purge
        and allow the inclusion of certain TLVs in purges.
      </t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>
          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
          "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
          this document are to be interpreted as described in
          <xref target='RFC2119'/>. 
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title='Registry Changes'>
      <t>
        This document extends the current "IS-IS TLV Codepoints" registry,
        defined in <xref target='RFC3563'/>, to record the set of TLVs that
        MAY be found in purges.  All other TLVs MUST NOT appear in purges.
        This will serve as an aid to subsequent documents, which can then
        refer to the registry as the definitive list of the TLVs allowed in
        purges.  This will also act as an aid to implementers, providing
        them with an easily accessible compendium of allowable TLVs.
      </t>

      <t>
        The purge status defined for a given TLV applies to all sub-TLVs
        defined for that TLV.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title='Purges and Authentication'>
      <t>
        Previous documents on authentication <xref target='RFC5304'/>
        <xref target='RFC5310'/> required that an IS only accept a purge if
        it only contained the Authentication TLV.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document updates and generalizes that behavior as follows: an
        implementation that implements authentication MUST NOT accept a
        purge that contains any TLV listed in the registry that is not
        acceptable in a purge.  An implementation MUST NOT accept a purge
        that contains a TLV not listed in the registry unless the purge
        also contains the Purge Originator Identification (POI) TLV
        <xref target='RFC6232'/>.  Purges that are accepted
        MUST be propagated without removal of TLVs.  If multiple purges are
        received for the same LSP, then the implementation MAY propagate
        any one of the purges.
      </t>
      <t>
        If an implementation that implements authentication accepts a purge
        that does not include the POI TLV and it chooses to insert the POI
        TLV, it MUST also recompute authentication.
      </t>
      <t>
        ISs MUST NOT accept LSPs with a non-zero Remaining Lifetime that
        contain the POI TLV.
      </t>
      <t>
        Purge generation is updated as follows: an implementation that
        implements authentication generates a purge by first removing any
        TLVs that are not listed in the registry as being acceptable in
        purges. The POI TLV MUST be added.  Then any other TLVs that MAY be
        in purges, as shown by the registry, MAY be added.  Finally,
        authentication, if any, is added.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
        IANA has modified the "IS-IS TLV Codepoints"
        registry by adding a column in the registry for 'Purge'.  A 'y' in
        this column indicates that the TLV for this row MAY be found in a
        purge.  An 'n' in this column indicates that the TLV for this row
        MUST NOT be found in a purge.
      </t>

      <t>
        The 'Purge' column should initially contain a 'y' for TLV type 10
        (Authentication) and for TLV type 137 (Dynamic hostname).  All
        other entries in this column should have an 'n'.  Other additions
        to this registry should explicitly specify their value for this
        column.
      </t>

      <t>
        This document introduces no new security issues.
