    <t>
      In this document we
      provide a basic description of ICMP's role in the IP
      stack and some guidelines for future use.</t>
    <t>
      This document is motivated by concerns about lack of clarity concerning when to add
      new Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) types
      and/or codes. These concerns have highlighted a need to describe
      policies for when adding new features to ICMP is
      desirable and when it is not.
    </t>
  </abstract>

  <section title='Introduction'>
    <t>There has been some recent concern expressed about a
      lack of clarity around when new message types
      and codes should be added to ICMP
      (including <xref target='RFC0792'>ICMPv4</xref>
      and <xref target='RFC4443'>ICMPv6</xref>).  We 
      lay out a policy regarding when (and when not) to
      move functionality into ICMP.
</t>

    <t>This document is the result of discussions among ICMP
      experts within the Operations and Management (OPS) area's
      
        IP Diagnostics Technical Interest Group <xref target="DIAGNOSTICS"/> and concerns
      expressed by the OPS area leadership.</t>

    <t>Note that this document does not
      supercede the <xref target='RFC2780'>"IANA Allocation
      Guidelines For Values In the Internet Protocol and
      Related Headers" </xref>, which
      specifies best practices and processes for the
      allocation of values in the IANA registries but does
      not describe the policies to be applied in the
      standards process.
</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

  </section>

  <section title='Acceptable Use Policy' anchor='aup'>
    <t>In this document, we describe an acceptable use
      policy for new ICMP message types and codes, and provide
      some background about the policy.</t>

    <t>In summary, any future message
      types added to ICMP should be limited to two broad
      categories:</t>

    <t><list style='numbers'>
        <t>to inform a datagram's originator that a forwarding plane
          anomaly has been encountered downstream.  The datagram originator
          must be able to determine whether or not the datagram was
          discarded by examining the ICMP message.</t>
        <t>to discover and convey dynamic information about a node
        (other than information usually carried in routing protocols), 
        to discover and convey network-specific parameters, 
        and to discover on-link routers and hosts.</t>
    </list></t>
    <t>
  Normally, ICMP SHOULD NOT be used to implement a general-purpose routing
    or network management protocol.
  However, ICMP does have a role to play in conveying dynamic
  information about a network, which would belong in category 2
  above.
    </t>

      <section title="ICMP Use as a Routing Protocol">
<t>
As mentioned in <xref target="aup" />,
using ICMP as a general-purpose routing or
   network management protocol is not advisable
   and SHOULD NOT be used that way.
</t><t>
ICMP has a role in the Internet 
as an integral part of the IP layer; 
it is not as a routing protocol or as a transport
protocol for other layers including
routing information.
From a more pragmatic perspective, some of the key characteristics of ICMP 
make it a less-than-ideal choice for 
a routing protocol.

   These key characteristics include that ICMP is
   frequently filtered, is not authenticated, and is easily spoofed.  In
   addition, specialist hardware processing of ICMP would disrupt the
   deployment of an ICMP-based routing or management protocol.
</t>
      </section>

      <section title="A Few Notes on RPL">
<t>
  RPL, the IPv6 routing protocol for low-power and
  lossy networks (see <xref target='RFC6550' />)
  uses ICMP as a transport.
  In this regard, it is an exception among the ICMP
  message types.  Note that, although RPL is an IP 
  routing protocol, it is not deployed on the general
  Internet; it is limited to specific, contained networks.
</t><t>
  This should be considered anomalous and is not a model for future
  ICMP message types. That is, ICMP is not intended as a transport for
  other protocols and SHOULD NOT be used in that way in future
  specifications. In particular, while it is adequate to use ICMP
  as a discovery protocol, it does not extend to full routing
  capabilities.
</t>

      </section>
    </section> <!-- classification of existing message types -->

    <section title="Applications Using ICMP">
      <t>
Some applications make use of ICMP error notifications, or even deliberately
create anomalous conditions in order to elicit ICMP messages. These
ICMP messages are then used to generate feedback to the higher layer.
Some of these applications include some of the most widespread examples, such as 
PING, TRACEROUTE, and Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD).
   These
   uses are considered acceptable because they use existing ICMP message types
   and do not change ICMP functionality.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Extending ICMP">
      <t>
        ICMP multi-part messages are specified in <xref target="RFC4884" />
        by defining an extension mechanism for selected ICMP messages.
        This mechanism addresses a fundamental problem in ICMP
        extensibility.
        An ICMP multi-part message carries all of the information
        that ICMP messages carried previously, as well as additional
        information that applications may require.</t>
      <t>
        Some currently defined ICMP extensions include ICMP extensions
        for Multiprotocol Label Switching <xref target="RFC4950" /> and
        ICMP extensions for interface and next-hop identification
        <xref target ="RFC5837" />. </t>
      <t>
        Extensions to ICMP SHOULD follow the requirements provided in
        <xref target="RFC4884" />.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="ICMPv4 vs. ICMPv6">
      <t>
       Because ICMPv6 is used for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, 
       deployed IPv6 routers, IPv6-capable security gateways,
       and IPv6-capable firewalls normally support administrator 
       configuration of how specific ICMPv6 message types are handled.  
       By contrast, deployed IPv4 routers, IPv4-capable security gateways, 
       and IPv4-capable firewalls are less likely to allow an administrator 
       to configure how specific ICMPv4 message types are handled.
       So, at present, ICMPv6 messages usually have a higher 
       probability of travelling end-to-end than ICMPv4 messages.
      </t>
    </section>

  </section> <!-- acceptable use policy -->

  <section title="ICMP's Role in the Internet">
    <t>ICMP was originally intended to be a mechanism for gateways
      or destination hosts
      to report error conditions back to source 
      hosts in <xref target='RFC0792' >ICMPv4</xref>;
      <xref target="RFC4443" >ICMPv6</xref> is modeled after it.
ICMP is also used to perform IP-layer functions, such as diagnostics
(e.g., PING).
</t>

<t>
ICMP is defined to be an integral part of IP and
must be implemented by every IP module. This is true for
ICMPv4 as an integral part of IPv4 (see the Introduction
of <xref target='RFC0792' />), and for
ICMPv6 as an integral part of IPv6 (see Section 2
of <xref target='RFC4443' />).
When first defined,
ICMP messages were thought of as IP
messages that didn't carry any higher-layer data.
It could be conjectured that the term "control" was used
because ICMP messages were not "data" messages.
</t>

<t>
      The word "control" in the protocol name did not describe
      ICMP's function (i.e., it did not "control" the Internet); 
      rather, it was used to communicate about the control
      functions in the Internet.  For example, even though ICMP
      included a redirect message type that affects routing behavior in the
      context of a LAN segment, it was not and is not used as a
      generic routing protocol.</t>


  </section>

 <!-- management vs control -->

  <section title='Security Considerations'>
    <t>This document describes a high-level policy
      for adding ICMP types and codes.  While special attention
      must be paid to the security implications of any particular
      new ICMP type or code, this recommendation presents no
      new security considerations.</t>
<t>From a security perspective, ICMP plays a part in the 
<xref target='RFC2521'>Photuris protocol</xref>.
But more generally, ICMP is not a secure protocol and 
does not include features to be used to discover network security
parameters or to report on network security anomalies in the
forwarding plane.</t>
<t>
Additionally, new ICMP functionality (e.g., ICMP extensions, or new ICMP
types or codes) needs to consider potential ways that ICMP can be abused
(e.g., <xref target='CA-1998-01'>Smurf IP DoS</xref>).
</t>
  </section> <!-- security considerations -->

  <section title='Acknowledgments'>
    <t>This document was originally proposed by, and received
      substantial review and suggestions from, Ron Bonica.
      Discussions with Pascal Thubert helped clarify the
      history of RPL's use of ICMP.  We are very grateful for the review,
      feedback, and comments from Ran Atkinson, Tim Chown, 
      Joe Clarke, Adrian Farrel, Ray Hunter, Hilarie Orman, Eric Rosen,
      JINMEI Tatuya, and Wen Zhang, which resulted in a much
      improved document.
