  The General Area Review Team (Gen-ART) has been doing reviews of
  Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) since 2004. This document discusses the
  experience and the lessons learned over the past 7 years of this
  process. The review team initially reviewed the I-Ds before each of
  the IESG telechats. Since late 2005, review team members have been
  assigned to review I-Ds during IETF Last Call, unless no IETF Last Call
  is necessary for the I-D. The same reviewer then reviews any updates
  when the I-D is placed on an IESG telechat agenda.

  <section anchor="intro" title = "Introduction" >
    <t>
      The General Area Review Team (Gen-ART) was created personally by the
      General Area Director in 2004. This document discusses the experiences
      and the lessons learned as the process has evolved over 
      the past 7 years.  The process described in this document reflects that
      which was in place at the time this document
      was published.  This process is likely to continue to change over time.
      The review team has been
      retained by subsequent General Area Directors. It has no official
      role in the IETF standards process, except
      as a set of individuals entitled, like everyone, to comment on
      Internet-Drafts (I-Ds). Its volunteers, including a secretary and the
      team of reviewers, serve at the invitation of the General AD.
      Both the reviews and the reviewer names are public.
    </t>

  </section>  
  
  <section title ="Who Are the Gen-ART Members?" anchor="Who">

    <t>
      The reviewers are typically individuals that have a fair amount of experience
      within various IETF Working Groups (WGs), have authored WG I-Ds and RFCs,
      and are often considered to
      be subject matter experts (SMEs) in their particular areas of work.
      The current review team is comprised
      of such technical experts, including several WG chairs as well as
      past and current Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
      members. Several past and current ADs have served as reviewers.
      Two past General ADs have also served as reviewers, with one currently serving.
    </t>
    <t>Members of the review team sometimes excuse themselves from the team for various
  reasons, typically due to "day job" demands. However, they often rejoin 
  (for periods of time) as their schedules allow.
  Also, some reviewers remain on the team, while their review workload is decreased 
  by assigning them just one I-D (at Last Call time) to review each month. 
  <xref target="ack" /> provides a list of currently active reviewers, along with 
  those who have served on the review team in the past. </t>
</section>

<section title = "Goals of Gen-ART" anchor="goals">
<t>
The original and continuing goal of the Gen-ART was, and is, 
to offload from the General AD some of the burden of IESG reviews.  
The load for the bi-weekly IESG reviews is often quite large;
occasionally, there are more than 20 I-Ds scheduled for discussion
in a single telechat.  Thus, ADs also have less than a week's notice
for many of the I-Ds on the telechat agenda. 
</t>
<t>
Gen-ART was based on a model that had proved productive in the
Operations (OPS) Directorate: quick review close to telechat time, 
to advise the AD on issues that remain serious. 
By having a trusted group of reviewers read and evaluate the I-Ds, 
the General AD would be able to concentrate on those I-Ds where 
there was a concern expressed by the reviewer.  The reviewers are 
expected to provide feedback based on a whole set of criteria, including 
the criteria summarized in <xref target="form"></xref>. 
The overall objective is to ensure that the I-Ds are well structured;
can be easily understood, at least at a high level; and provide a 
reasonable basis for implementation (for I-Ds intended for the Standards Track). 
</t>
  <t>While other area (and WG) directorates/review teams existed prior
  to Gen-ART and 
  more have been established since Gen-ART, the roles of each are fairly distinct. 
  Thus, there 
  is little overlap between the goals and review criteria for the various
  review teams. It is also very 
  valuable for these other review teams to operate independently. For
  example, when both Gen-ART reviews and Security Directorate (SecDir) reviews raise the 
  same sorts of concerns, it's a clear red flag that the I-D
  needs more work before progressing.  In addition, due to the typical
  thoroughness (and objectiveness) of the various review teams' reviews, 
  the sponsoring AD and document shepherd
  are often able to work with the editors/WG (and vice versa, depending 
  upon area and WG structure) to improve the overall 
  quality of the final I-D. It should also be noted that some ADs take the
  Gen-ART reviews into consideration when preparing their own evaluations.</t>

  <t>Statistics from the Gen-ART reviews over the past 6+ years show 
  a trend of increased quality and readiness for progression of I-Ds
  by the time they are placed on the telechat agenda. Additional statistics 
  are discussed in <xref target="results" />.
</t>

</section>

  <section title = "Gen-ART Reviews" anchor="process">

    <section title = "IETF Last Call Review Process" anchor = 'ietflc'>
      <t>
        While the original process was meant only for reviews just before the
        IESG telechat, the decision was made to include IETF Last Call (LC)
        reviews in early 2005. Over time the latter has proven to be quite
        effective. Assigning the I-Ds at IETF LC
        time typically gives a reviewer more time to review an I-D.
        And, in some cases, the IETF LC version is the one to appear on the telechat.
        Thus, by the time I-Ds are added to the telechat agenda, a majority (typically
        at least 70%) have already been reviewed. For those I-Ds that have
        been up-versioned, the amount of time dedicated to re-review depends
        upon the review summary for the IETF LC review.
      </t>
      <t>
        The assignments at IETF LC time evolved to minimize the gap between LC
        announcements and assignment time, with the secretary doing LC
        assignments every Thursday night.  This typically allows the reviewer
        at least one week and sometimes two to three weeks to complete the
        review. The reviews are obviously most helpful when done on or before
        the end of the IETF LC.
      </t>
      <t>
        The Last Call assignments are done on a fairly strict
        round-robin basis to ensure a fair workload amongst all the reviewers.
        Reviewers that are
        unavailable (vacations, etc.) during the review period timeframe obviously
        are excluded from that round of assignments,
        but remain in the same queue position for the next round.
        The order is occasionally modified to avoid
        assigning an editor/author or WG chair their own I-Ds.
        A reviewer may also NACK an assignment if they feel they may have some bias
        (although corporate affiliations are not considered to be sources of
        bias) or they don't feel they can review the I-D in a timely manner.
      </t>

      <t>
        The assignment process is completely manual, although
        a spreadsheet tremendously facilitates
        the process. The details are described in <xref target="details"/>.
        Ideally, this process could be automated. However,
        manual intervention would still be required to maintain the appropriate
        available reviewer list (unless reviewers took on the task of maintaining
        their data in some sort of database).  Further details
        on the tools necessary to automate the entire process are provided in
        <xref target="improve" />.
      </t>

    </section>


    <section title = "IESG Telechat Review Process">
      <t>
        The process for reviewing I-Ds when they appear on the IESG
        agenda is as follows:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style = "symbols">
          <t>
            The "nearly final" IESG meeting agenda
            generally appears on Thursday night, less than one week before the IESG
            telechat.
            The Gen-ART secretary uses this as the input for the assignment process.
          </t>
          <t>
            For I-Ds reviewed at IETF Last Call, a new review is only
            asked for if the I-D is revised. In this case the reviewer, typically
            the person who did the Last Call review, only needs to check
            that any open issues were resolved.  Often the draft will not have
            changed between IETF LC and the IESG telechat review. <xref target="processdetails"/>
            provides the step-by-step telechat review assignment process,
            with specific details on the maintenance of the review assignment
            data, which is in turn maintained in review spreadsheets (<xref target="details"/>).
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title = "Form of Review" anchor = 'form'>
      <t>
        Rather than invent new guidelines, the Gen-ART requirements for the
        form of a review stole liberally from "Careful Additional Review of
Documents (CARD) by Senior IETF Reviewers (SIRS)" <xref target="SIRS"/>, making adaptations for the special "late,
        quick review" case and the nature of the General Area's concerns.
      </t>
      <t>
        Each review must start with a summary statement chosen from or adapted
        from the following list:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style = "symbols">
          <t>
            This draft is ready for publication as a [type] RFC, where
            [type] is Informational, Experimental, etc. (In some cases,
            the review might recommend publication as a different [type]
            than requested by the author.)
          </t>
          <t>
            This draft is basically ready for publication, but has nits
            that should be fixed before publication.
          </t>
          <t>
            This draft is on the right track but has open issues,
            described in the review.

            This draft has serious issues, described in the review, and
            needs to be rethought.
          </t>
          <t>
            This draft has very fundamental issues, described in the
            review, and further work is not recommended.
          </t>
          <t>
            Unfortunately, I don't have the expertise to review this
            draft.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        The length of a review can vary greatly according to circumstances,
        and it is considered acceptable for purely editorial comments to be sent
        privately if it's obvious that the I-D needs substantial
        revision. All substantive comments, however, must be
        included in the public review. Wherever possible, comments should be
        written as suggestions for improvement rather than as simple
        criticism. Explicit references to prior work and prior IETF discussion
        should be given whenever possible.
      </t>
      <t>
        Reviewers are asked to  review for all kinds of problems, such as
        basic architectural or security issues, Internet-wide impact, technical
        nits, problems of form and format (such as IANA Considerations or
        incorrect references), and editorial issues. Since these reviews are on
        I-Ds that are supposed to be finished, the review should consider
        "no issue too small" -- but should cover the whole range, from the
        general architectural level to the editorial level.
      </t>
      <t>
        All reviews should apply generally agreed-upon IETF criteria,
        such&nbsp;as:

            Any other applicable architectural or procedural
            documents. It is considered important that reviews give

    <section title="Gen-ART Process Overview" anchor="processdetails">

      <t>
        The following provides a general overview of the Gen-ART process along with some 
        basic rules associated with assignments. The very precise details of the 
        secretary's process are provided in <xref target="details"/>. 
      </t>


      <t>
        <list style = "symbols">
          <t>
            The availability of reviewers and the order of assignments for the next round of Last Call
            document assignments are updated weekly and are available on the directory where all the assignments
            and reviews are cached.  
          </t>
          <t>
            At telechat assignment time, all previously reviewed I-Ds are assigned to the reviewer who
            reviewed them previously, assuming that reviewer is available.
            Otherwise, these I-Ds
            are assigned to a new person in the process described below.
          </t>
          <t>
            The secretary attempts to avoid assigning I-Ds that might conflict with
            other IETF roles such as WG chairs, other directorates,
            etc. However, in the cases where the secretary doesn't
            note the conflict, the reviewer should notify the secretary and 
            Gen-ART mailing list so another reviewer may be assigned.  
          </t>
          <t> It should be emphasized that assignment is never made according to a
          reviewer's technical specialty.  Even though it happens, when, for
          example, routing I-Ds fall on routing experts or MIB documents fall
          on MIB doctors,
          it is coincidental. To the reviewer, the choice looks random.</t>
          <t>
            There is an attempt to evenly distribute I-Ds amongst reviewers at LC time by 
            using a round-robin process, starting 
             from where the previous week's assignments stopped.
           </t>

          <t> Typically, there is no attempt made to actually
              equalize the load, as the length and complexity of the I-Ds are not
              taken into account in this process. (Thus, a reviewer could end up
              with a couple of hundred-page I-Ds, but this is statistically rare.)
              However, in the case of a reviewer that might receive more than one new LC
              I-D at one time, the secretary does try to ensure that both are not
              large I-Ds. 
            </t>
         
          <t>
            Once the assignments are made, the web pages that list the reviews and
            the assignments are posted.  Since the telechat agenda is not published until 
            the end of the day on the Thursdays prior to the telechats (i.e., one week prior), 
            the secretary needs to complete the assignments on that Thursday evening.  This
            often requires working later in the evening and also requires an Internet connection 
            even when traveling.  
          </t>

          <t>
            If the reviewers notice any problems or
            conflict of interest, a bargaining process, shifting I-Ds from one
            reviewer to another, takes place.  The secretary updates the assignment
            files with any new assignments.
          </t>
          <t>
            Once the review has been completed, the reviewer
            sends the review to the Gen-ART list, ideally using the template
            provided in the review assignment emails.
            Typically,
            reviews are also sent to authors, the responsible AD, and the WG chairs/document 
            shepherd.
            The only case where this might not be done is when
            there are no issues found for a re-review and none had been found on
            an initial review. 
            Sending the review to the authors, ADs, and/or WG chairs/Proto Shepherds
            was originally voluntary
            but is now considered standard practice.
            Reviewers may also send the reviews to the IETF discussion list, but that 
            is entirely
            at the discretion of the reviewer, in which case the author must 
            be copied on the review to ensure they see any follow-up discussion.
            Reviewers may also send the 
            comments to the WG; however, this typically causes the review to end 
            up in the moderation queue, as most reviewers do not want to subscribe
            to the WG lists for the I-Ds they review. Thus, it is expected 
            that any of the original recipients (i.e., authors,
            WG chairs/document shepherd, or responsible AD) may 
            forward the review to the WG mailing list if they believe it is 
            necessary. In the past, sending these reviews
            resulted in confusion among the authors, who may not have been
            expecting a Gen-ART review and may not be familiar with Gen-ART.
            Thus, reviewers are reminded to
            prepend to the email the description of Gen-ART and the purpose
            of the review. This information is part of the standard template
            provided in the review assignment emails.
          </t>
          <t>
            The secretary gathers the reviews, sometimes edits them for format,
            and records the review in the spreadsheet on the web pages,
            including the synopsis.
            This is typically done on Thursday. This is one aspect of the process that can be
            easily delegated such that one volunteer uploads all the reviews and then the secretary
            need only update the fields in the spreadsheet. 
            If
            the reviewer has not provided a synopsis ("Summary" field in the template),
            the secretary makes a best
            guess based on the review details. Note that in most cases the reviewers
            do include a synopsis.

          </t>
          <t>
            Ideally, the reviews should be posted to the Gen-ART mailing list
            by close of business on the East coast on Tuesday.  This is necessary to allow the General AD
            time to consider the reviews prior to the telechat.
            If the reviews
            are received after Tuesday, the review may not be read by the AD 
            before the IESG telechat.
            Due to time constraints, the spreadsheets containing review summaries/assignments
            are only updated on Thursday evenings when the new LC assignments and upcoming telechat
            assignments are done.  Ideally, the reviews would get uploaded on the Tuesdays prior 
            to the telechat along with the updated spreadsheets. 
          </t>

          <t>
            If the AD concludes that the concerns raised by the reviewer warrant
            placing a DISCUSS comment on the I-D, the AD will do so, and the
            DISCUSS must be resolved before the I-D advances. 
            Usually, the reviewer
            will be involved in the resolution process, 
            but the responsibility for the DISCUSS rests with the AD.

  <section title="Secretarial Process" anchor="details" >
    <t>This section summarizes the details of managing the review materials, including 
    the spreadsheet used to track all reviews and the HTML files containing the review 
    assignments. Please note that these details represent a snapshot of a
process that has been implemented -- the details are very likely to change
over time, in particular as the needed improvements highlighted in
<xref target="improve" /> are carried out.</t>

    <section title="Maintaining Review Spreadsheet" anchor ="maintain">

      <t>
        A spreadsheet is used to enter all the I-Ds at the time of assignment
        and to capture
        all the reviews.  For IETF LC assignments, the assignments are completed before
        adding the I-Ds to the spreadsheet as described in <xref target="LCassign"/>.
        For telechat assignments, I-Ds are obviously only added in the cases
        where there is no previous LC assignment. For the other I-Ds, the appropriate fields
        are updated as described in <xref target="TCassign"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
        All the reviews can be accessed from the spreadsheet via hyperlinks from
        specific fields, as summarized below.
        The following information is maintained in the spreadsheet (in the order listed):
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>
            "Chat/LC Date": Indicates either the date on which the LC review
            is due or the date of the telechat.
          </t>

          <t>
            "Document": Filename for the I-D, which includes a hyperlink
            to the IETF I-D tracker.
          </t>

          <t>"Assigned": Name of the reviewer assigned to that I-D.</t>

          <t>
            "Category": This field contains one of the following self-explanatory values: 
            "Doc - WG", "Doc - Ind/AD", or "IETF LC". Note that Gen-ART does not review I-Ds 
            submitted directly to the RFC Editor. 
            The "IETF LC" value is of course entered for all I-Ds at LC time.
            It is changed to one of the other appropriate values, based on the 
            information in the telechat agenda.
          </t>

          <t>
            "Previous Review": This includes a link to any previous reviews. For example,
            when a doc appears on a telechat agenda, if an IETF LC review was done, this
            field is updated with the review summary for the LC review (i.e., the information
            from the "Current Review Summary" as described below is copied to this column). 
            The field
            is set to "New" when an I-D is first assigned/added to the spreadsheet. In
            the case of returns, this field has a value of "Return" or "Return/IETF-LC" for
            I-Ds for which there is an LC review. It should be noted that since Gen-ART
            started doing reviews at LC time, there seem to be far fewer returns on the agenda.
          </t>

          <t>
            "Current Review Summary": This field includes the review type and version number of the document 
            that is to be reviewed or has been reviewed (e.g., LC: -02). 
            When the field also contains a review
            summary after the review type/version number (e.g., Telechat: -06 Ready), the active 
            hyperlink 
            points to
            the review. Occasionally, a reviewer
            will re-review an I-D prior to its telechat assignment, in which case it is
            added to the spreadsheet, but the date does not change to maintain consistency
            in the date field, since the reviews themselves contain the review date.
          </t>

        </list>
      </t>


      <t> </t>

      <t>
        The following summarizes the steps to add a new I-D to the spreadsheet:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>
            In order to optimize steps, blank rows are first inserted for the number of new
            I-Ds to be added.
          </t>
          <t>
            To minimize data entry, a row with default fields (including the
            hyperlinks)
            is kept at the end of the file. There is a separate default row for IETF LC versus telechat
            assignments. This row is copied into each of the new blank rows. The dates
            are then entered (this allows double-checking that all I-Ds
            from the review assignments are accounted for, especially LC).
          </t>
        
          <t>
            The I-D name is then copied to the name field as well as being appended to the hyperlink 
            for the "Review Summary" field. The hyperlink is included as part of the default row. 
            This minimizes the steps to enter the reviews in the spreadsheet.
          </t>
          <t> 
            The data is also sorted by "Chat/LC Date", "Assigned",
            and "Document". The file is then saved and closed.
          </t>
          <t>
            The file is then reopened and saved as HTML.
          </t>
          <t>
            The file is opened a second time and sorted by "Assigned", "Chat/LC Date", and "Document" to 
            provide the I-D reviewers an easy way to find any outstanding assignments. 
          </t>

        </list>
      </t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="Last Call Assignment Procedure" anchor="LCassign">
      <t>The secretary can cache the Last Call assignments as they are announced
      and/or check the IETF announcement mailing list archives. The assignments
      are done on Thursday evening, along with any telechat assignments. This optimizes 
      the process in terms of batch changes to files. </t>

      <t>The assignments are listed in an HTML file. The following are the steps in 
      creating that file:
      </t>
      <t>
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>The order of assignment is actually created the week before, with the details below. 
        Thus, before starting
        the new assignments, the current file is saved for editing for the 
        following week. The current file-naming
        convention is "reviewersyymmdd-lc.html" (e.g., for July 8th, 2010, the file 
        reviewers100708-lc.html was created, and
        the file for the following week is named reviewers100715&nbhy;lc.html).</t>
        <t>Since the file is already prepared with the appropriate ordering of reviewers, the 
        assignments are done
        in the order of due dates. 
        The link to the I-D in the Datatracker is copied into the assignment file along with the
        intended RFC status
        for each of the new LC I-Ds.
        </t>
        <t>The "Due Date" paragraph from the Last Call announcement is shortened as follows: 
        "IETF LC ends on:", keeping the date.</t>
       
        <t>Once the assignment file is complete, the new I-Ds are added to the 
        spreadsheet as described above. </t>
        <t>
          The assignment file for the next week is then updated to reflect the next reviewer 
          in the round-robin process,
          by simply cutting and pasting the names in the list in a block and 
          removing any "one doc per month" reviewers (annotated with an "*") that
          have already received their monthly assignment. If the next round of assignments 
          occurs at the beginning of a new
          month, the "one doc per month" reviewers are added back into the list 
          (in the normal order -- alphabetically by first name).
        </t>
        <t>The assignment files and updated spreadsheets are then cached on the Gen-ART server.  </t>
        <t>An email providing a link to the assignment file along with the updated spreadsheets
        is sent to the Gen-ART mailing list.
        This email has a standard form, such that the reviewers can simply cut and paste the template to 
        include the Gen-ART context statement and link to the FAQ.</t>

    <section title="Telechat Assignment Procedure" anchor="TCassign">
      <t>
        Since LC assignments are now the starting point for Gen-ART I-D reviews, 
        the telechat assignments are generally
        straightforward, as the majority of the I-Ds are already in the spreadsheet. 
        The following details the steps:
        
      </t>
      <t>
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>
          The telechat agenda is typically available around 6PM PDT.  
          In order to create the assignment HTML file, the agenda
          is created from the email announcing the upcoming telechat agenda. 
          The filename has the following format, with the date corresponding to the telechat date 
          (versus the date of assignment, as is the case for Last Call assignments):
           "reviewersyymmdd.html". 
        </t>
        <t>Rows are added to the agenda for the reviewers' names. </t>
        <t>The reviewers' names are then added to the weekly assignment file.</t>
        <t> As each reviewer is added to the assignment file, the review spreadsheet is updated as follows:
        
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>"Chat/LC Date" is changed to the telechat date.</t>
            <t>The link to the LC review, if available, is copied as the 
            link for the "Previous Review" column.</t>
            <t> 
            The "text" for the "Current Review" is updated to reflect the new review type (i.e., 
            Telechat) and
            version.</t>
          </list>
        </t>


        <t> In the case of an I-D that did not go through IETF LC, a reviewer is assigned using the 
        order in the file to be used for Last Call assignments for the next week.  </t>

        <t>Once the reviewer(s) have been determined, the LC assignment file for the next week is updated.</t>
        
        <t> Any new I-Ds are then added to the spreadsheet (and the updates saved) per 
        the steps described in <xref target="maintain"></xref>.
        </t>

          <t>
            The assignment files and updated spreadsheets are then cached on
            the Gen-ART server.

          <t>
            An email providing a link to the assignment file along with the updated spreadsheets

<section title = "Results" anchor="results">
<t>
  Over the past 7 years, the Gen-ART has provided reviewing services to 3 ADs
  and has done around two thousand publicly available reviews.
  The reviews have been executed with a team of around a dozen full-time reviewers and 
  other reviewers receiving one I-D assignment each month. There are currently 
  9 reviewers in the latter category. 
  The full-time reviewers receive 2-3 assignments each month.
  In terms of improving quality, the number of I-Ds that are now "Ready"
  at the time of the telechat (since the reviews are now initiated at LC
  time) has increased.  The review term "Ready" means the reviewer
  believes that the document has no outstanding editorial or technical issues.
  Based on the data from 2007, there were over 250
  I-Ds assigned at LC time that went through IESG review.  
  Of those 250 I-Ds, 82% of the LC reviews (205 I-Ds) were completed. 
  Of the completed reviews, 70% (144 I-Ds) were "Ready" at the time of
  the telechat. Of those 144 I-Ds, roughly 1/4 had been deemed "Ready" (with
  no nits) at LC time (based on a sample of 50 reviews).  For the I-Ds that
  were not reviewed at LC time, only about 1/4 of those were deemed "Ready"
  when they were reviewed for the telechat. So, doing the Gen-ART reviews at 
  Last Call time does seem to improve the quality of the I-Ds for the telechat.

<section anchor="impressions" title = "Impressions">
<t>
This section is divided into 3 subsections: the impressions as
gathered from the Gen-ART, the impressions of the ADs
for whom they worked, and the impressions of the secretaries of Gen-ART.
<!--
    might be sueful to also have  IESG and authors comments, but
    it is probably too late for that now
  -->
</t>  
<section title = "Reviewers' Impressions">
  <t>
    The following list of comments are excerpted and edited
    from comments sent in by the reviewers of Gen-ART in response to the
    request:
  </t>
<t>
  "We'd
like to ask you each to write a few lines about your personal
experience and lessons learned as a Gen-ART reviewer".</t>
  
  <t>  
<list style = 'symbols'>
<t>
We really do find problems, but we don't find problems with most I-Ds.
</t>
<t>
Comments seem to be in three areas: editorial/grammar,
editorial/what-the-heck-does-this-mean, and actual problems. I'm
seeing fewer reviews in the first category, which is a good thing. 
</t>

<t>
It is becoming rarer that we hear back "these guys have suffered
enough; I'm voting no objection" (I'm remembering an LDAP I-D that had been around so long it had 2119
referenced AS A DRAFT -- some people suffered a lot). 
</t>
<t>
   The direct assignment of reviews is necessary and effective.  It
   does not matter much as far as I can tell what scheme is used to
   actually do the assignment. 
</t>
<t>
   Folks are very open to the reviews that come out of Gen-ART.   This
   somewhat surprised me, because I have seen resistance to outside
   reviews in other cases. 
</t>

<t>
  The improvements that have
  come about (for example, one of my latest, an I-D about the
  SIPPING conference) have made a big difference to the
  comprehensibility and usability of the I-Ds -- and provide a
  useful incentive to keep going.
</t>
<t>
   Some form of review like this is desperately needed.  While most of
   the stuff we see is good, every once in a while really bad errors
   have made their way all the way to IESG vote. 
</t>
<t>
   Reading this stuff is interesting.  I like having a reason to read
   a wide range of materials. 
</t>
<t>
  I am more than convinced that this can be, and is, a valuable process.
  It is, in my opinion, a pity that Senior IETF Reviewers (SIRS)
  and so on did not take off, because this late-stage reviewing is a
  poor substitute for doing the same thing at a much earlier stage.
  Very few of the drafts that have come past my screen are truly fully
  ready for IESG review. It is actually a joy to find the
  occasional nugget that is both well written and is a proper
  technical job, such that the reviewer really can say "This is ready".
</t>
<t>
  I have certainly found the process intellectually stimulating! It
  encourages me to take a wider interest in what is going on in the
  IETF, but consumes a fair bit of time to do a proper job, and
  requires a very wide knowledge to be able to properly catch the
  cross-area implications:  I hope (believe!) that this is something
  that one gets better at with experience and doing a few of these
  reviews. 
</t>
<t>
  There is probably a very limited pool of people who have both the time
  and the inclination to keep on doing these reviews.  It does require a
  fair bit of dedication.
</t>
<t> 
  It is difficult to avoid correcting the English, even if
  that is not really the point: Often, really bad English (whether as a
  result of non-mother-tongue authors with limited grasp or
  mother-tongue authors using informal language) obscures/corrupts what is
  being said or just makes it impossible to read. 
</t>
<t> 
  Mostly authors welcome the comments: I think most of them understand
  the concept of "ego-free reviewing", and we have generally been
  constructive rather than destructive. 
</t>
<t> 
  Part of the job of
  Gen-ART is to think the unthinkable from another point of view, to
  challenge (apparently undocumented) assumptions, and apply experience
  from other fields.

<section anchor="AD" title ="General Area Directors' Impressions">
  <t> It should be noted that these impressions are from multiple
  General Area Directors; thus, the "I"s are not necessarily 
  associated with a specific AD.</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">  
  <t>
It's essential. The reviewing load for the IESG 
&lt;shout>DOES NOT SCALE&lt;/shout>.
</t>
<t> Without Gen-ART, I would be a much less effective General AD.</t>
<t>
On a single fortnight example, the IESG had 
21 drafts on the agenda. It is just impossible (to conscientiously review all the 
documents),
and no wonder we sometimes miss serious issues.
</t>
<t>
So I think a distributed review team with about 30 trusted reviewers needs
to be institutionalized. I suspect that will need to be formalized in
a BCP sooner or later -- with their reviews having a formal position
in the standards process, and the expectation that the whole IESG truly
reviews all I-Ds being relaxed. 
</t>
<t>
We've learned that polite, well reasoned, constructive reviews
are very positively received by authors and WGs. Dismissive reviews
are counter-productive. And reviews sent in private eventually show
up in public, so it's better to go public at the start.
</t>
<t>
Normally, LC reviews are available in good time for the draft to 
be revised before reaching the IESG agenda. 
It is important that this happens, except for an emergency situation 
where the responsible AD has good reason to place the draft on the agenda immediately.
In that case, it would be preferable for the AD to inform the  
Gen-ART, so that the review can be expedited.
</t>
<t>
The other problem is a big detail -- between late Thursday or
early Friday when the secretary sends out the assignments, and
Wednesday when the General AD likes to start filling in ballots
based on the reviews received by close of business on Tuesday, 
there are only
three work days (plus possible volunteer time over the weekend).
Now even with only one I-D to review, that may be a real
challenge. Sometimes, a lucky reviewer will get 130 pages
(e.g., draft-ietf-nntpext-base-27). That doesn't compute.
</t>
<t>
There are some mechanical issues. The process followed
is far too manual. Everything needs to be robotic
except for the judgment calls about which reviewer gets which
draft. Similarly, the reviewer should be able to just paste the
review into a web form, click, and it's sent off to everyone
appropriate and posted to the review site.
</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>
<section title = "Gen-ART Secretaries' Impressions">
  
<t>
Serving as the secretary of Gen-ART is a worthwhile experience.
From a personal point of view, it gives the secretary an easy way to track all of
the work going through the IESG review process and see how the work
flowed through that process.  Also, by reviewing and sometimes
creating the one-line abstracts that go on the review web page, 
the secretary has an opportunity to really get a
survey of the work being approved by the IETF.
</t>
<t>
The nature of these reviews is informal,
and originally the reviews were only intended for the General AD,
though they were made public.  During 2004, there was little if any
interaction between authors and reviewers. 
There was some discussion during 2004 about trying to expand the role of
Gen-ART to a more formal, early-review model, i.e., to evolve it into a
form of SIRS.  
The original Gen-ART secretary was against such a
transformation, because she felt it would put at risk something that worked.
She believed that there were risks inherent in formalizing the reviews and
adding mechanisms for standardizing the resultant review process. Another
concern involves the interaction between reviewers and authors.  As
discussed above, it has become the practice to send reviews to the authors
with an explanation about the nature of Gen-ART reviews.  While it is
clear that this has resulted in improved RFCs, it has also resulted in
increased workload for the reviewers.
</t>
<t>
The secretary thinks that Gen-ART is an experiment that works well, but
she also believes it is fragile.  
The secretary is often concerned about overburdening reviewers,
and feels it is her responsibility to keep them from burning out.
Adding additional reviewers to the review team would help to alleviate
this concern. In terms of the process, adding additional reviewers has minimal impact. 
</t>

<section title = "Needed Improvements" anchor="improve">
  <t>
    The current size of the review team introduces a fairly heavy workload
    for the individual reviewers that are not on the "one doc per month"
    assignment cycle.
    Additional reviewers would be really helpful to alleviate this workload.
    It is also important to note that having additional reviewers adds
    minimal workload to the secretary's process; thus, the only blocking
    point is finding the right folks that
    are interested in this type of volunteer role.  As noted in <xref target="AD"/>,
    30 would be a good size for the review team. This would cut the workload
    for an individual reviewer in half (given the current model of 9
    reviewers on the "one doc per month" assignment cycle).
  </t>

  <t>Obviously, automation of the process would be a good thing. However, 
  Gen-ART secretaries are not necessarily highly motivated to transition to a more automated
  approach until a significant part of the process is automated.  In more recent 
  consideration of this situation, it likely would be best to first automate the 
  process of entering the reviews, as that benefits the review team as a whole.
  This automation should allow the reviewers to enter the reviews via a web interface 
  that would automatically generate the appropriate emails -- quite similar to how 
  the draft "Upload" tool currently works. 
  Also, given consistent naming conventions for the review forms, this step would
  automate some of the process for the secretary, as the reviews would automatically
  appear via the spreadsheet hyperlinks, although there would still be a need to 
  manually enter the summary. But this would eliminate the need 
  to edit/normalize and upload files and, hopefully, eliminate the 
  problem encountered with unflowed text in emails and getting the review properly 
  formatted using some text editors. </t>

  <t> <xref target="details"/> was written to facilitate the process of determining 
  tools requirements, by providing the very detailed steps currently applied to the 
  process. As noted above, automating the upload of the reviews could be a good first 
  step. This is somewhat starting at the end of the process. However, it seems that 
  by automating in this direction, we may have optimal results; since one of the 
  earliest steps in the process is the 
  task of assigning reviewers, it likely needs the most manual 
  intervention, even with tools available.</t>
  
 <t>
   The current SecDir secretary does use some tools for
   assignments and
   generating assignment emails. These tools could be considered for use by
   the Gen-ART secretary. Since the SecDir reviews are not cached
   and the information maintained for those reviews is less
   detailed, there would be no reusability of that aspect.
   However, if the Gen-ART spreadsheet can be automatically populated (with assignments
   and completed reviews), the SecDir may be able to make use of that same tool.

<section title = "Applicability" anchor="use">
<t>
  As implemented today, the process has no formal role in the IETF
  standards process. But as trust
  in the review team has built, and as the team itself has learned to
  deliver reviews that are generally well received, they have had a
  significant impact on I-D quality and on timeliness. Rather
  than becoming a roadblock, they have (in general) allowed the General AD
  to feel more confident in reaching decisions and be more precise in
  resolving issues.
  Since reviews now typically appear during IETF Last Call, the reviews,
  like the SecDir reviews, are now generally expected. So, the role 
  of the team has evolved to be more formal than in the past (i.e., when
  this document was first drafted in 2005).

  However, the handling
  of the reviews remains entirely within the scope of the ADs, document shepherds, WG chairs,
  and authors as they deem appropriate.

  <section title = 'Security Considerations'>
    <t>
      Since this is an informational I-D about an open process, the
      security considerations are specific to the process and users involved
      in the process. The primary concern would be to limit
      the people that have the ability to create and update the Gen-ART data/files to ensure that the
      integrity of the data is maintained.  For example, each Gen-ART reviewer should have
      a unique user name/password, just as folks do to access any other
      IETF-maintained data, as appropriate.
