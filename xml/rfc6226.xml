<t>
Each Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) router in a PIM
domain that
supports Any Source Multicast (ASM) maintains Group-to-RP mappings that are
used to identify a Rendezvous Point (RP) for a specific multicast group. 
PIM-SM has defined an algorithm to choose a RP from the Group-to-RP mappings
learned using various mechanisms. This algorithm does not consider
the PIM mode and the mechanism through which a Group-to-RP mapping was learned.
</t>

<t>
This document defines a standard algorithm to deterministically choose between
several Group-to-RP mappings for a specific group. This document first explains
the requirements to extend the Group-to-RP mapping algorithm and then proposes
the new algorithm.
</t>
</abstract>

<middle>
<section title="Introduction">
<t>
Multiple mechanisms exist today to create and distribute Group-to-RP
mappings. Each PIM-SM router may learn Group-to-RP mappings through various
mechanisms, as described in Section 4.
</t>
<t>
It is critical that each router select the same 'RP' for a specific
multicast group address; otherwise, full multicast connectivity will
not be established. This is true even when using an Anycast RP to provide
redundancy.  This RP address may correspond to a different physical router,
 but it is one
logical RP address and must be consistent across the PIM domain. This is
usually achieved by using the same algorithm to select the RP in all the PIM
routers in a domain.
</t>
<t>
PIM-SM <xref target='RFC4601'/> has defined an algorithm to select a 'RP' for a
given multicast group address, but it is not flexible enough for an
administrator to apply various policies. Please refer to Section 3 for more
details.
</t>
<t>
The PIM-STD-MIB <xref target='RFC5060'/> includes a number of objects to
allow an
administrator to set the precedence for Group-to-RP mappings that
are learned statically or dynamically and stored in the
'pimGroupMappingTable'. The Management Information Base (MIB) module also
defines an algorithm that can be applied to the data contained in the
'pimGroupMappingTable' to determine Group-to-RP mappings.
However, this algorithm is not completely deterministic, because it
includes an implementation-specific 'precedence' value.
</t>
<t>
Network management stations will be able to deduce which RPs will
be selected by applying the algorithm from this document to the
list of Group-to-RP mappings from the 'pimGroupMappingTable'.
The algorithm provides MIB visibility into how routers will apply 
Group-to-RP mappings and also fixes the inconsistency introduced 
by the way that different vendors implement the selection of the 
Group-to-RP mappings to create multicast forwarding state.
</t>
<t>
Embedded-RP, as defined in Section 7.1 of "Embedding the Rendezvous
Point (RP) Address in an IPv6 Multicast Address" <xref target="RFC3956"/>, specifies the following: "To avoid loops and inconsistencies,
for addresses in the range ff70::/12, the Embedded-RP mapping
MUST be considered the longest possible match and higher priority
than any other mechanism".
</t>


</section>
 
<section title="Terminology">
<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
this document are to be interpreted as described in
RFC 2119 <xref target='RFC2119'/>.</t>

<t>
This document also uses the following terms:
</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>
PIM Mode
</t>
</list>

 <list style="empty"><t>
 PIM Mode is the mode of operation for which a particular
 multicast group is used.
 Wherever this term is used in this document, it refers to either Sparse Mode
 or Bidirectional (BIDIR) Mode.
 </t></list>

<list style="symbols">
<t>
Dynamic Group-to-RP Mapping Mechanisms
</t>
</list>

 <list style="empty"><t>
 The term "dynamic Group-to-RP mapping mechanisms" in this document refers to
 Bootstrap Router (BSR) <xref target='RFC5059'/> and Auto-RP.
 </t></list>

<list style="symbols">
<t>
Dynamic Mappings and Dynamically Learned Mappings
</t>
</list>

 <list style="empty"><t>
 The terms "dynamic mappings" and "dynamically learned mappings"
 refer to
 Group-to-RP mappings that have been learned by either BSR or Auto-RP.
 Group-to-RP
 mappings that have been learned by Embedded-RP are referred to as Embedded
 Group-to-RP mappings.
 </t></list>

<list style="symbols">
<t>
Filtering
</t>
</list>

 <list style="empty"><t>
 Filtering is the selective discarding of dynamic Group-to-RP mapping information,
 based on the group address, the type of Group-to-RP mapping message, and the
 interface on which the mapping message was received.
 </t></list>

<list style="symbols">
<t>
Multicast Domain and Boundaries
</t>
</list>

 <list style="empty"><t>
 The term "multicast domain" used in this document refers to a network topology
 that has a consistent set of Group-to-RP mappings. The interface between two
 or more multicast domains is a multicast domain boundary. The multicast
 boundaries are usually enforced by filtering the dynamic mapping messages
 and/or configuring different static RP mappings.
 </t></list>

</section>

<section title="Existing Algorithm">
<t>
The existing algorithm defined in PIM-SM (Section 4.7.1 of
 <xref target='RFC4601'/>) does not consider the following constraints:
</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>
It does not consider the origin of a Group-to-RP mapping and therefore will
treat all of them equally.
</t>
<t>
It does not provide the flexibility to give higher priority to a specific PIM
mode. For example, an entry learned for the PIM-BIDIR Mode is treated with the
same priority as an entry learned for PIM-SM.
</t>
</list>
<t>
The algorithm defined in this document updates the algorithm defined in PIM-SM
(Section 4.7.1 of <xref target='RFC4601'/>). The new algorithm is backward
compatible and will produce the same result only if the Group-to-RP
mappings are
learned from a single mapping source. The full benefits of the new algorithm
will not be realized until it is widely deployed. 
</t>
</section>
<section title="Assumptions">
<t>
We have made the following assumptions in defining this algorithm:
</t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
A Group-to-RP mapping can be learned from various mechanisms. We assume that
the following list is ordered by decreasing preference for these mechanisms:
</t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
Embedded Group-to-RP mappings
</t>
<t>
Dynamically learned mappings
</t>
<t>
Static configuration
</t>
<t>
Other mapping method
</t>
</list>
<t>
Embedded Group-to-RP mappings are special and always have the highest priority.
They cannot be overridden by static configuration or by dynamic
Group-to-RP mappings.
</t>
<t>
Dynamic mappings will override a static RP configuration if they have
overlapping
ranges. However, it is possible to override dynamic Group-to-RP mappings with
static configurations, either by filtering, or by configuring longer static
group addresses that override dynamic mappings when longest prefix matching is
applied.
</t>
<t>
A Group-to-RP mapping learned for PIM-BIDIR Mode is preferred to an entry
learned for PIM-SM Mode as stipulated in Section 3.3 of <xref target='RFC5059'/>.
</t>
<t>
Dynamic Group-to-RP mapping mechanisms are filtered at domain boundaries or
for policy enforcement inside a domain. 
</t>
</list>
</section>

<section title="Common Use Cases">

<t>A network operator deploying IP Multicast will require a deterministic way
to select the precedence for Group-to-RP mappings in the following use cases:
</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>
Default static Group-to-RP mappings with dynamically learned entries
</t>
</list>

 <list style="empty"><t>
 Many network operators will have a dedicated infrastructure for the standard
 multicast group range (224/4) and so might be using statically configured
 Group-to-RP mappings for this range. In this case, to support some specific
 applications, they might want to learn Group-to-RP mappings dynamically using
 either the BSR or Auto-RP mechanism. In this case, to select Group-to-RP
 mappings
 for these specific applications, a longer prefix match should be given
 preference over statically configured Group-to-RP mappings. For example,
 239.100.0.0/16, an administratively scoped multicast address range, could be
 learned for a corporate communications application. Network operators may
 change the Group-to-RP mappings for these applications more often, and
 the mappings would
 need to be learned dynamically. This is not an issue for IPv6 Multicast
 address ranges.
 </t></list>

<list style="symbols">
<t>
Migration situations
</t>
</list>

 <list style="empty"><t>
 Network operators occasionally go through a migration due to an acquisition or
 a change in their network design. In order to facilitate this migration, there
 is a need to have a deterministic behavior of Group-to-RP mapping selection
 for entries learned using the BSR and Auto-RP mechanisms. This will help in
 avoiding
 any unforeseen interoperability issues between different vendors' network
 elements.
 </t></list>

<list style="symbols">
<t>
Use by management systems
</t>
</list>

 <list style="empty"><t>
 A network management station can determine the RP for a specific group in a
 specific router by running this algorithm on the Group-to-RP mapping table
 fetched using MIB objects.
 </t></list>
</section>

<section title="Proposed Algorithm">
<t>
The following algorithm deterministically chooses between several Group-to-RP
mappings for a specific group. It also addresses the above-mentioned
shortcomings in the existing mechanism.
</t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>
If the multicast group address being looked up contains an embedded RP, the RP
address extracted from the group address is selected as the Group-to-RP mapping.
</t>
<t>
If the multicast group address being looked up is in the Source Specific
Multicast (SSM) range or is configured for Dense Mode, no Group-to-RP mapping
is selected, and this algorithm terminates. The fact that no Group-to-RP
mapping has been selected can be represented in the PIM-STD-MIB module
<xref target='RFC5060'/> by
setting the address type of the RP to 'unknown', as described in
Section&nbsp;8.
</t>
<t>
From the set of all Group-to-RP mapping entries, the subset whose group prefix
contains the multicast group that is being looked up is selected.
</t>
<t>
If there are no entries available, then the Group-to-RP mapping is
undefined, and this algorithm terminates.
</t>
<t>
A longest prefix match is performed on the subset of Group-to-RP mappings.
</t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
If there is only one entry available, then that entry is selected as
the Group-to-RP mapping.
</t>
<t>
If there are multiple entries available, the algorithm continues with
this smaller set of Group-to-RP mappings.
</t>
</list>

<t>
From the remaining set of Group-to-RP mappings, we select the
subset of entries based on the preference for the PIM modes
to which the multicast group addresses are assigned.
A Group-to-RP mapping entry with PIM Mode 'BIDIR' will be preferred to an
entry with PIM Mode 'PIM-SM'.
</t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
If there is only one entry available, then that entry is selected as
the Group-to-RP mapping.
</t>
<t>
If there are multiple entries available, the algorithm continues with
this smaller set of Group-to-RP mappings.
</t>
</list>
<t>
From the remaining set of Group-to-RP mappings, we select the subset of the
entries based on the origin. Group-to-RP mappings learned dynamically are
preferred over static mappings. If the remaining dynamic Group-to-RP mappings
are from BSR and Auto-RP, then the mappings from BSR are preferred. 
</t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
If there is only one entry available, then that entry is selected as
the Group-to-RP mapping.
</t>
<t>
If there are multiple entries available, the algorithm continues with
this smaller set of Group-to-RP mappings.
</t>
</list>
<t>
If the remaining Group-to-RP mappings were learned through BSR, then the RP
will be selected by comparing the RP Priority values in the
Candidate-RP-Advertisement
messages. The RP mapping with the lowest value indicates the highest priority <xref target='RFC5059'/>.
</t>
<list style="symbols"> 
<t>
If more than one RP has the same highest priority (i.e., the same lowest
value), the algorithm continues with those Group-to-RP mappings.
</t>

<t>
If the remaining Group-to-RP mappings were NOT learned from BSR, the
algorithm continues with the next step.
</t>
</list>

<t>
If the remaining Group-to-RP mappings were learned through BSR and the PIM
Mode of the group is 'PIM-SM', then the hash function as defined in Section
4.7.2 of <xref target='RFC4601'/> will be used to choose the RP. The RP with
the highest resulting hash value will be selected. Please
see Section 10 for consideration of hash for BIDIR-PIM and BSR.
</t>
<list style="symbols"> 
<t>
If more than one RP has the same highest hash value, the
algorithm continues with those Group-to-RP mappings.
</t>
<t> 
If the remaining Group-to-RP mappings were NOT learned from BSR,
the algorithm continues with the next step.
</t>
</list>
<t>
From the remaining set of Group-to-RP mappings, the RP with the
highest IP address (numerically greater) will be selected.
This will serve as a final tiebreaker. 
</t>
</list>
</section>

<section title="Interpretation of MIB Objects">
<t>
As described in <xref target='RFC5060'/>, the Group-to-RP mapping information
is summarized in the pimGroupMappingTable. The precedence value
is stored in the 'pimGroupMappingPrecedence' object, which covers
both the dynamically learned Group-to-RP mapping information
and the static configuration. For static configurations, the
'pimGroupMappingPrecedence' object uses the value of the
'pimStaticRPPrecedence' object from the pimStaticRPTable.
</t>

<t>
The algorithm defined in this document does not use the concept of
precedence, and therefore the values configured in the
'pimGroupMappingPrecedence' and 'pimStaticRPPrecedence' objects in
the PIM-STD-MIB module <xref target='RFC5060'/> are not applicable to the new
algorithm. The objects still retain their meaning for 'legacy'
implementations, but since the algorithm defined in this document is to
be used in preference to those found in PIM-SM <xref target='RFC4601'/> and
the PIM-STD-MIB <xref target='RFC5060'/>, the values of these objects will be
ignored on implementations that support the new algorithm.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Clarification for MIB Objects">
<t>
An implementation of this specification can continue to be managed using the
PIM-STD-MIB <xref target='RFC5060'/>. 
Group-to-RP mapping entries are created in the pimGroupMappingTable for group
ranges that are SSM or Dense mode.  In these cases, the
pimGroupMappingRPAddressType object is set to unknown(0), and the PIM Mode in
the pimGroupMappingPimMode object is set to either ssm(2) or dm(5) to reflect
the type of the group range.
</t>

<t>
Also, all the entries that are already included in the SSM Range
table in the IP Multicast MIB <xref target='RFC5132'/> are copied to the
pimGroupMappingTable. Such entries have their type in the
pimGroupMappingOrigin object set to configSsm(3) and the RP
address type in the pimGroupMappingRPAddressType object set to
unknown(0), as described above.
</t>
</section>
 
<section title="Use of Dynamic Group-to-RP Mapping Protocols">
<t>
   It is not usually necessary to run several dynamic
   Group-to-RP mapping mechanisms in one administrative domain.
   Specifically, interoperation of BSR and Auto-RP is OPTIONAL.
</t>
 
<t>
   However, if a router does receive two overlapping sets of Group-to-RP
   mappings, for example from Auto-RP and BSR, then some algorithm is needed
   to deterministically resolve the situation. The algorithm in this document
   MUST be used on all routers in the domain. This can be important at domain
   border routers, and is likely to avoid conflicts caused by misconfiguration
   (when routers receive overlapping sets of Group-to-RP mappings) and when
   configuration is changing.
</t>
 
<t>
   An implementation of PIM that supports only one mechanism for learning
   Group-to-RP mappings MUST also use this algorithm.  The algorithm has
   been chosen so that existing standard implementations are already
   compliant.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Considerations for Bidirectional-PIM and BSR Hash">

<t>
BIDIR-PIM <xref target='RFC5015'/> is designed to avoid any data-driven events.
This is especially true in the case of a source-only branch. The RP mapping is
determined based on a group mask when the mapping is received through a
dynamic mapping protocol or statically configured.
</t>
<t>
Therefore, based on the algorithm defined in this document, the hash
in BSR is ignored for PIM-BIDIR RP mappings.  It is RECOMMENDED that network
operators configure only one PIM-BIDIR RP for each RP Priority. 
</t>
</section>

<section title="Filtering Group-to-RP Mappings at Domain Boundaries">
<t>
    An implementation of PIM SHOULD support configuration to filter specific
    dynamic mechanisms for a valid group prefix range. For example, it should
    be possible to allow an administratively scoped address range, such as
    239/8, for the Auto-RP protocol, but to filter out the BSR
    advertisement for
    the same range. Similarly, it should be possible to filter out all
    Group-to-RP mappings learned from BSR or the Auto-RP protocol.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
   This document enhances an existing algorithm to deterministically
   choose between several Group-to-RP mappings for a specific group.
   Different routers may select a different Group-to-RP mapping for the
   same group if the Group-to-RP mappings learned in these routers are
   not consistent. For example, let us assume that BSR is not enabled
   in one of the routers, and so it does not learn any Group-to-RP
   mappings from BSR.  Now the Group-to-RP mappings learned in this
   router may not be consistent with other routers in the network; it may
   select a different RP or may not select any RP for a given group.
   Such situations can be avoided if the mechanisms used to learn Group-
   to-RP mappings are secure and consistent across the network. Secure
   transport of the mapping protocols can be accomplished by using 
   authentication with IPsec, as described in Section 6.3
   of <xref target='RFC4601'/>.
