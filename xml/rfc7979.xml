        The U.S.&nbsp;National Telecommunications and Information
	Administration (NTIA) solicited a request from the Internet Corporation
	for
   Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to propose
        how the NTIA should end its oversight of the Internet Assigned Numbers
	Authority (IANA) functions.
        After broad consultations, ICANN in turn created the IANA
        Stewardship Transition Coordination Group.  That group
        solicited proposals for the three major IANA functions:
        names, numbers, and protocol parameters.  This document
        contains the IETF response to that solicitation for protocol
        parameters.  It was included in an aggregate
        response to the NTIA alongside those for names and numbering
        resources that are being developed by their respective
        operational communities.  A reference to that response may
	be found in the introduction, and
        additional correspondence is included in the Appendix.

    <section title="IETF Introduction">
      <t>In March of 2014, the U.S.&nbsp;National Telecommunications and
      Information Administration (NTIA) announced its intent to
      transition oversight of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
      (IANA) functions <xref target="NTIA-Announce"/>.  In that
      announcement, NTIA asked the Internet Corporation for Assigned
      Names and Numbers (ICANN) to establish a process to deliver a
      proposal for transition.  As part of that process, the IANA
      Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) was formed.  The
      charter for the ICG can be found in
      <xref target="ICG-Charter"/>.  The ICG in turn solicited proposals
      regarding post-transition arrangements from the names, numbers,
      and protocol parameters communities in order to put forth a
      proposal to the NTIA.  The final
      request for proposal (RFP) can be found in
      <xref target="ICG-RFP"/>.  The response from the ICG to the NTIA
      may be found at <xref target="ICG-Response" />.
      </t>
      <t>While there are interactions between all of the IANA
      functions and IETF standards, this document specifically
      addresses the protocol parameters registries function.  Section
      1 (this section) contains an introduction that is sourced solely
      within the IETF.  Section 2 contains the questionnaire that was
      written by the ICG and a formal response by the IETF.  We have
      quoted questions from that questionnaire with "&gt;&gt;&gt; ",
      and we have prefaced answers to questions being asked with "IETF
      Response:".  Note that there are small changes to the questions
      asked in order to match the RFC format.

      <t>We note that the following text was stated as a footnote in the
      original RFP:

        IETF Response:
      </t>
      <t>Many IETF protocols make use of commonly defined protocol
        parameters. These parameters are used by implementers, who are
        the primary users of the IETF standards and other
        documents.  To ensure consistent interpretation of these
        parameter values by independent implementations, and to
        promote universal interoperability, these IETF protocol
        specifications define and require globally available registries
        containing the parameter values and a pointer to any
        associated documentation. The IETF uses the IANA
        protocol parameters registries to store this information in a
        public location. The IETF community presently accesses the
        protocol parameter registries via references based on the iana.org
        domain name, and makes use of the term "IANA" in the protocol
        parameter registry processes <xref target="RFC5226"/>.
      </t>  
      <t>ICANN currently operates the .ARPA top level domain on behalf
        of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB).  This zone is used
        for certain Internet infrastructure services that are
        delegated beneath it.  The IETF considers .ARPA part of the
        protocol parameters registries for purposes of this response.
      </t>

      <t>IETF Response:</t>
      <t>
        The IANA protocol parameters registries operator maintains the
        protocol parameters registries for the IETF in conformance with
        all relevant IETF policies, in accordance with the Memorandum
        of Understanding <xref target="RFC2860"/> and associated
        supplemental agreements that include service level agreements
        (SLAs) established between the IETF and
        ICANN <xref target="MOUSUP"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The IETF is a global organization that produces voluntary standards,
        whose mission is to produce high quality, relevant technical and
        engineering documents that influence the way people design, use,
        and manage the Internet in such a way as to make the Internet work
        better <xref target="RFC3935" />.  IETF
        standards are published in the RFC series.  The IETF is
        responsible for the key standards that are used on the
        Internet today, including IP, TCP, DNS, BGP, and HTTP, to name
        but a few.
      </t>
     <t>
        The IETF operates in an open and transparent manner
        <xref target="RFC6852" />.  The processes that govern the IETF
        are also published in the RFC series.  The Internet Standards
        Process is documented in <xref target="RFC2026" />.  That
        document explains not only how standards are developed, but
        also how disputes about decisions are resolved.  RFC 2026 has
        been amended a number of times <xref target="BCP9info"/>.  The
        standards process can be amended in the same manner that
        standards are approved.  That is, someone proposes a change by
        submitting a temporary document known as an Internet-Draft,
        the community discusses it, and if rough consensus can be
        found the change is approved by the Internet Engineering
        Steering Group (IESG), who also have day-to-day responsibility
        for declaring IETF consensus on technical decisions, including
        those that affect the IANA protocol parameters registries.
        Anyone may propose a change during a Last Call, and anyone may
        participate in the community discussion.

</t>
<t>
  IETF Response:
  </t>
<t>The protocol parameters registries are the product of IETF
  work. These also include the top-level registry for the entire IP
  address space and some of its sub-registries, autonomous system
  number space, and a number of special use registries with regard to
  domain names. For more detail please refer to the documentation in
  the "overlaps or interdependencies" section.</t>
<t>
  Administration of the protocol parameters registries is the service
  that is provided to the IETF.

      </t>
     <t>
       IETF Response:
       </t>
     <t>In this context, the IETF considers "overlap" to be where
     there is in some way shared responsibility for a single registry
     across multiple organizations.  In this sense, there is no
     overlap between organizations because responsibility for each
     registry is carefully delineated.  There are, however, points of
     interaction between other organizations, and a few cases where
     the IETF
     may further define the scope of a registry for technical
     purposes.  This is the case with both names and numbers, as
     described in the paragraphs below.  In all cases, the IETF
     coordinates with the appropriate organizations.
     </t>
     <t>
       It is important to note that the IETF does not have formal
       membership.  The term "the IETF" includes anyone who wishes to
       participate in the IETF, and IETF participants may also be
       members of other communities.  Staff and participants
       from ICANN and the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) regularly
       participate in IETF activities.
      </t>
      <t></t>
      <t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>
          The IETF has specified a number of special use registries
          with regard to domain names.  These registries require
          coordination with ICANN as the policy authority for the DNS
          root, including community groups that are responsible for
          ICANN policy on domain names such as the Generic Names
          Supporting Organization (GNSO) and the Country Code Names
          Supporting Organization (ccNSO).
          There are already mechanisms in place to perform this
          coordination, and the capacity to modify those mechanisms to meet new
          conditions as they might arise. <xref target="RFC6761" />
        </t>
        <t>
          The IETF specifies the DNS protocol.  From time to time
          there have been and will be updates to that protocol. As we
          make changes we will broadly consult the operational
          community about the impact of those changes, as we have done
          in the past.
        </t>
        <t>
          The IETF specifies minimum requirements for root
          servers. <xref target="RFC2870"/>
          Those requirements are currently under review, in
          consultations with the root server community.
        </t>
        <t>
          The routing architecture has evolved over time, and is
          expected to continue to do so.  Such evolution may have an
          impact on appropriate IP address allocation strategies.  If
          and when that happens, the IETF will consult and coordinate
          with the RIR community, as we have done in the past.
        </t>
        <t>
          The IETF is responsible for policy relating to the entire IP
          address space and AS number space.  Through the IANA
          protocol parameters registries, the IETF delegates unicast
          IP address and AS number ranges to the RIRs
          <xref target="RFC7020"/>,<xref target="RFC7249"/>.  Special
          address allocation, such as multicast and anycast addresses,
          often require coordination.  Another example of IP addresses
          that are not administered by the RIR system is Unique Local
          Addresses (ULAs) <xref target="RFC4193"/>, where local
          networks employ a prefix that is not intended to be routed
          on the public Internet.  New special address allocations are
          added, from time to time, related to the evolution of the
          standards.  In all cases, these special assignments are
          listed in the IANA protocol paramters registries.</t>
        <t>
          The IETF maintains sub-registries for special IPv4 and IPv6
          assignments.  These are specified in
          <xref target="RFC3307"/>, <xref target="RFC5771"/>, and
          <xref target="RFC6890"/>.  The IETF coordinates such
          assignments with the RIRs.
        </t>
        <t>
          Changes to IETF standards may have impact on operations of RIRs
          and service providers.  A recent example is the extensions
          to BGP to carry the Autonomous System numbers as four-octet
          entities <xref target="RFC6793"/>.  It is important to note
          that this change occurred out of operational necessity, and
          it demonstrated strong alignment between the RIRs and the
          IETF.

        IETF Response:

<t>
        Policy for overall management of the protocol parameters
        registries is stated in <xref target="RFC6220" /> and
        <xref target="RFC5226" />.  The first of these documents
        explains the model for how the registries are to be operated,
        how policy is set, and how oversight takes place.  RFC 5226
        specifies the policies that specification writers may employ
        when they define new protocol registries in the "IANA
        Considerations" section of each specification.  All policies
        at the IETF begin with a proposal in the form of an
        Internet-Draft.  Anyone may submit such a proposal.  If there
        is sufficient interest, a working group whose scope includes
        the proposed work may choose to adopt it, the IESG
         may choose to create a working
        group, or an Area Director may choose to sponsor the draft.
        In any case, anyone may comment on the proposal as it
        progresses.  A proposal cannot be passed by the IESG unless it
        enjoys sufficient community support as to indicate rough
        consensus <xref target="RFC7282" />.  In each case, a "Last
        Call" is made so that there is notice of any proposed change
        to a policy or process.  Anyone may comment during a Last
        Call.  For example, this process is currently being used to
        update RFC 5226
        <xref target="I-D.leiba-cotton-iana-5226bis"/>.

<t></t>
<t>IETF Response:
</t>
<t>Most disputes are handled at the lowest level through the working
  group and rough consensus processes.  Should anyone disagree with
  any action, Section 6.5 of <xref target="RFC2026" /> specifies a
  multi-level conflict resolution and appeals process that includes
  the responsible Area Director, the IESG, and the IAB.  Should
  appeals be upheld, an appropriate remedy is applied.  In the case
  where someone claims that the procedures themselves are
  insufficient or inadequate in some way to address a circumstance,
  one may appeal an IAB decision to the Internet Society Board of
  Trustees.

          things, confirming appointment of IESG members, managing
          appeals as discussed above, management of certain domains,
          including .ARPA <xref target="RFC3172" />, and general
          architectural guidance to the broader community.  The IAB
          must approve the appointment of an organization to act as
          IANA operator on behalf of the IETF.  The IAB is also
          responsible for establishing liaison relationships with
          other organizations on behalf of the IETF.  The IAB's
          charter is to be found in <xref target="RFC2850" />.
          </t>
          <t>
        The IAB members are selected and may be recalled through a
        Nominating Committee (NOMCOM) process, which is described in
        <xref target="RFC3777"/> and its updates.  This process provides for
        selection of active members of the community who themselves
        agree upon a slate of candidates. The active members are
        chosen randomly from volunteers with a history of
        participation in the IETF, with limits regarding having too
        many active members with the same affiliation.  The selection
        of the active members is performed in a manner that makes it
        possible for anyone to verify that the correct procedure was
        followed.  The slate of candidates selected by the active
        members are sent to the Internet Society Board of Trustees for
        confirmation. In general, members are appointed for terms of
        two years.  The IAB selects its own chair.
      </t>
        <t>The IAB provides oversight of the protocol parameters
          registries of the IETF, and is responsible for selecting
          appropriate operator(s) and related per-registry
          arrangements.  Especially when relationships among protocols
          call for it, registries are at times operated by, or in
          conjunction with, other bodies. Unless the IAB or IETF has
          concluded that special treatment is needed, the operator for
          registries is currently ICANN.

        IETF Response:
        </t>
      <t>
        A memorandum of understanding (MoU) between ICANN and the IETF
        community has been in place since 2000.  It can be found in
        <xref target="RFC2860" />. The MoU defines the work to be
        carried out by the IANA functions operator for the IETF and
        the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), a peer organization
        to the IETF that focuses on research.<xref target="RFC2014"/>
        Each year a service 
        level agreement is negotiated that supplements the MoU.
      </t>
      <t>
        Day-to-day administration and contract management is the
        responsibility of the IETF Administrative Director (IAD).  The
        IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) oversees the
        IAD.  The members of the IAOC are also the trustees of the
        IETF Trust, whose main purpose is to hold certain intellectual
        property for the benefit of the IETF as a whole.
        IAOC members are appointed by the Internet Society Board
        of Trustees, the IAB, the IESG, and the NOMCOM
        <xref target="RFC4071" />.  The IAOC works with the IANA
        functions operator to establish annual IANA performance
        metrics <xref target="METRICS"/> and operational procedures,
        and the resulting document 
        is adopted as an supplement to the MoU each year
        <xref target="MOUSUP"/>.  Starting from 2014, in accordance
        with these supplements, an annual audit is performed to ensure that
        protocol parameter requests are being processed according to
        the established policies.  The conclusions of this audit will
        be available for anyone in the world to review.
      </t>
      <t>
          To date there have been no unresolvable disputes or issues
          between the IETF and the current IANA functions operator.
        <xref target="RFC2860"/> specifies that should a technical
          dispute arise, "the IANA shall seek and follow technical
          guidance exclusively from the IESG."
        In the unlikely event that a more difficult situation should arise,
        the IAOC and the IAB would engage ICANN management to address
        the matter.  The MoU also provides an option for either party
        to terminate the arrangement with six months notice. Obviously
        such action would only be undertaken after serious
        consideration.  In that case a new IANA functions operator
        would be selected, and a new agreement with that operator
        would be established.

      <t>
        IETF Response:
      </t>
      <t>
No new organizations or structures are required.  Over the years since
the creation of ICANN, the IETF, ICANN, and IAB have together created
a system of agreements, policies, and oversight mechanisms that
already cover what is needed.  This system has worked well without any
operational involvement from the NTIA.
</t><t>
IANA protocol parameters registry updates will continue to function
day-to-day, as they have been doing for the last decade or more.  The
IETF community is very satisfied with the current arrangement with
ICANN. RFC 2860 remains in force and has served the IETF community
very well.  RFC 6220 has laid out an appropriate service description
and requirements.
</t><t>
However in the absence of the NTIA contract a few new arrangements may
be needed in order to ensure the IETF community's expectations are
met.  Those expectations are the following:
<list style="symbols">
  <t>
    The protocol parameters registries are in the public domain. It is the
    preference of the IETF community that all relevant parties acknowledge
    that fact as part of the transition.
  </t>
  <t>
    It is possible in the future that the operation of the protocol
    parameters registries may be transitioned from ICANN to subsequent
    operator(s). It is the preference of the IETF community that, as part
    of the NTIA transition, ICANN acknowledge that it will carry out the
    obligations established under C.7.3 and I.61 of the current IANA
    functions contract between ICANN and the
    NTIA <xref target="NTIA-Contract"/> to achieve a smooth transition
    to subsequent operator(s), should the need arise. Furthermore, in
    the event of a transition it is the expectation of the IETF
    community that ICANN, the IETF, and subsequent operator(s) will
    work together to minimize disruption in the use the protocol
    parameters registries or other resources currently located at
    iana.org. 
      </t>
  </list>
</t>
      <t>
        In developing our response we have been mindful of the
        following points that the IETF community has discussed over
        the last year <xref target="ProtoParamEvo14"/> that have led
    to the following guiding principles for IAB efforts that impact
    IANA protocol parameter registries. These principles must be
    taken together; their order is not significant.
      </t>
      <t>1. The IETF protocol parameters registries function has been and
         continues to be capably provided by the Internet technical
         community.
      </t>
      <t>
        The strength and stability of the function and its foundation
        within the Internet technical community are both important
        given how critical protocol parameters are to the proper
        functioning of IETF protocols.
      </t>
      <t>
        We think the structures that sustain the protocol parameters
        registries function need to be strong enough that they can be
        offered independently by the Internet technical community,
        without the need for backing from external parties.  And we
        believe we largely are there already, although the system can
        be strengthened further, and continuous improvements are being
        made.
      </t>
      <t></t> 
      <t>
        2. The protocol parameters registries function requires openness,
        transparency, and accountability. 
      </t>
      <t>
        Existing documentation of how the function is administered and
        overseen is good <xref target="RFC2860" />,
        <xref target="RFC6220" />.  Further articulation and clarity
        may be beneficial.  It is important that the whole Internet
        community can understand how the function works, and that the
        processes for registering parameters and holding those who
        oversee the protocol parameters function accountable for
        following those processes are understood by all interested
        parties.  We are committed to making improvements here if
        necessary.
      </t>
      <t></t> 
      <t>
        3. Any contemplated changes to the protocol parameters registries
        function should respect existing Internet community agreements. 
      </t>
      <t>
        The protocol parameters registries function is working well.
        The existing Memorandum of Understanding in RFC 2860 defines
        "the technical work to be carried out by the Internet Assigned
        Numbers Authority on behalf of the Internet Engineering Task
        Force and the Internet Research Task Force."  Any
        modifications to the protocol parameters registries function
        should be made using the IETF process to update RFC 6220 and
        other relevant RFCs.  Put quite simply: evolution, not
        revolution.
      </t>
      <t></t>
      <t>
        4. The Internet architecture requires and receives capable
        service by Internet registries. 
      </t>
      <t></t>
      <t>
        The stability of the Internet depends on capable provision of
        not just IETF protocol parameters, but IP numbers, domain
        names, and other registries.  Furthermore, DNS and IPv4/IPv6
        are IETF-defined protocols.  Thus we expect the role of the
        IETF in standards development, architectural guidance, and
        allocation of certain name/number parameters to continue.  IP
        multicast addresses and special-use DNS names are two examples
        where close coordination is needed.  The IETF will continue to
        coordinate with ICANN, the RIRs, and other parties that are
        mutually invested in the continued smooth operation of the
        Internet registries. We fully understand the need to work
        together.
      </t>
      <t></t>
      <t>
        5. The IETF will continue management of the protocol
        parameter registry function as an integral component of the IETF
        standards process and the use of resulting protocols. 
      </t>
      <t></t>
      <t>
        RFC 6220 specifies the role and function of the protocol
        parameters registry, which is critical to IETF standards
        processes and IETF protocols.  The IAB, on behalf of the IETF,
        has the responsibility to define and manage the relationship
        with the protocol registry operator role.  This responsibility
        includes the selection and management of the protocol
        parameter registry operator, as well as management of the
        parameter registration process and the guidelines for
        parameter allocation.
      </t>
      <t></t>
      <t>
        6. The protocol parameters registries are provided as a public
        service.
      </t>
      <t></t>
      <t>
        Directions for the creation of protocol parameters registries
        and the policies for subsequent additions and updates are
        specified in RFCs.  The protocol parameters registries are
        available to everyone, and they are published in a form that
        allows their contents to be included in other works without
        further permission.  These works include, but are not limited
        to, implementations of Internet protocols and their associated
        documentation.
      </t>
      <t>
        These principles will guide the IAB, IAOC, and the rest of the
        IETF community as they work with ICANN to establish future
        IANA performance metrics and operational procedures.

</t>
<t>IETF Response:</t>
        <t>
          No structural changes are required for the handling of
          protocol parameters.  The principles listed
          above will guide IAB, IAOC, and the rest of the IETF
          community as they work with ICANN to establish future IANA
          performance metrics and operational procedures, as they have
          in the past.
        </t>
<t>As no services are expected to change, no continuity issues are
  anticipated, and there are no new technical or operational methods
  proposed by the IETF to test.  The IETF leadership, ICANN, and the
  RIRs maintain an ongoing informal dialog to spot any unforeseen issues
  that might arise as a result of other changes.</t>
<t>What is necessary as part of transition is the completion of
  any supplemental agreement(s) necessary to achieve the requirements
  outlined in our response in Section III of this RFP.

        Because the IETF is open to everyone, participation is open to

        used to develop this proposal.  Those same processes have been
        and shall be used to amend governance of the protocol

        propose amendments to those processes, and anyone may take
        part in the decision process.

        full access to the protocol specification published in the RFC
        series and the protocol parameters registries published at
        iana.org.  Those who require assignments in the IANA protocol
        registries will continue to have their requests satisfied, as

            discussion and participate in the development of this
            response.  An open mailing list (ianaplan@ietf.org) has
            been associated with the working group.  In addition,
            IETF's IANA practices have been discussed in the 
            broader community, and all input has been welcome. Normal
            IETF procedures <xref target="RFC2026"/>
            <xref target="RFC2418"/> were used to determine rough
            consensus.  The chairs of the working group reviewed open
            issues and, after an internal working group last call,
            determined that all had been satisfactorily addressed, and
            subsequently the IESG did a formal IETF-wide Last Call
            followed by a formal review and determined that the
            document had rough consensus.

      This document has attained rough consensus of the IETF Working
      Group and of the IETF community as a whole, as judged first by
      the working group chairs and then by the sponsoring Area Director,
      and then by the IESG in accordance with <xref target="RFC2026"/>
      during the 18 December 2014 IESG telechat. The IESG has approved
      the draft, pending insertion of this answer in this section and
      the IAB approval note. The IAB approved a statement for
      inclusion in the document on 19 December 2014.
    </t>
    <t>
      Over the course of the development of the document, several
      suggestions were raised that did not enjoy sufficient support to
      be included. Two general areas of suggestion that generated
      much discussion were

    <t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>A suggestion for a stronger statement over what terms the IAOC
          should negotiate.
          </t>
        <t>
          A suggestion that "iana.org" and other associated marks be
          transferred to the IETF trust.

      </list>
    </t>
    <t>
      At the end of the working group process, although there was not
      unanimous support for the results, the working group chairs
      concluded that rough consensus existed in the working group. The

    <t>During IETF last call, additional people voiced support for the
    document. There were several editorial comments that resulted in
    changes, as well as some discussion of more substantial comments
    some of which resulted in text changes. There was some discussion
    of comments already discussed earlier in the process, and but no
    new objections were raised during the IETF last call. A summary of
    the last call comments can be found from here:

    <t>New draft versions were prepared that took into account all the
    agreed changes from the last call. The final version was then
    approved by the IESG.

<abstract><t>Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants to identify various protocol parameters.  To ensure that the values used in these fields do not have conflicting uses, and to promote interoperability, their allocation is often coordinated by a central record keeper.  For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  To make assignments in a given registry prudently, IANA needs guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made.  This document defines a framework for the documentation of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the guidance given to IANA is clear and addresses the various issues that are likely in the operation of a registry.  This is the third edition of this document; it obsoletes RFC 5226.</t></abstract>

    <section title="The Charter of the IANA Stewardship Coordination
        Group (ICG)" anchor="ICG-Charter">

<t>Charter for the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group V.10
</t>
<t>     (August 27, 2014)
</t>
<t>
The IANA stewardship transition coordination group (ICG) has one
deliverable: a proposal to the U.S. Commerce Department
National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA) regarding the transition of NTIA's stewardship of the
IANA functions to the global multi-stakeholder community. The
group will conduct itself transparently, consult with a broad
range of stakeholders, and ensure that its proposals support
the security and stability of the IANA functions.
</t><t>
The group's mission is to coordinate the development of a proposal
among the communities affected by the IANA functions. The IANA
functions are divided into three main categories: domain
names, number resources, and other protocol parameters. The
domain names category falls further into the country code and
generic domain name sub-categories. While there is some
overlap among all of these categories, each poses distinct
organizational, operational and technical issues, and each
tends to have distinct communities of interest and
expertise. For those reasons it is best to have work on the
three categories of IANA parameters proceed autonomously in
parallel and be based in the respective communities.
</t><t>
The IANA stewardship transition process is taking place alongside a
parallel and related process on enhancing ICANN
accountability. While maintaining the accountability of
Internet identifier governance is central to both processes,
this group's scope is focused on the arrangements required for
the continuance of IANA functions in an accountable and widely
accepted manner after the expiry of the NTIA-ICANN
contract. Nevertheless, the two processes are interrelated and
interdependent and should appropriately coordinate their work.
</t><t>
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
The coordination group has four main tasks:
(i) Act as liaison to all interested parties, including the three
    "operational communities" (i.e., those with direct operational
    or service relationship with IANA; namely names, numbers,
    protocol parameters). This task consists of:
     a. Soliciting proposals from the operational communities
     b. Soliciting the input of the broad group of communities
        affected by the IANA functions
(ii) Assess the outputs of the three operational communities for
     compatibility and interoperability
(iii) Assemble a complete proposal for the transition
(iv) Information sharing and public communication
Describing each in more detail:
   (i) Liaison
     a. Solicit proposals
]]></artwork></figure>
</t>
<t>
The ICG expects a plan from the country code and generic name
communities (possibly a joint one), a plan from the numbers
community, and a plan from the protocol parameters community.
Members of the ICG will ensure that the communities from which they
are drawn are working on their part of the transition
plans. This involves informing them of requirements and
schedules, tracking progress, and highlighting the results or
remaining issues. The role of a coordination group member
during this phase is to provide status updates about the
progress of his or her community in developing their
component, and to coordinate which community will develop a
transition proposal for each area of overlap (e.g.,
special-use registry).
</t><t>
While working on the development of their proposals, the operational
communities are expected to address common requirements and
issues relating to the transition, in as far as they affect their
parts of the stewardship of IANA functions.
</t>
<t>
b. Solicit broader input
</t>
<t>
The ICG is open for input and feedback from all interested
parties. While no set of formal requirements related to a
transition proposal will be requested outside the operational
communities, everyone's input is welcome across all topics.
</t><t>
The ICG expects that all interested parties get involved as early as
possible in the relevant community processes. Input received
directly by the ICG may be referred to the relevant community
discussion.
</t><t>
The ICG members chosen from a particular community are the official
communication channel between the ICG and that community.
</t><t>
(ii) Assessment
</t><t>
When the group receives output from the communities it will discuss
and assess their compatibility and interoperability with the
proposals of the other communities. Each proposal should be
submitted with a clear record of how consensus has been
reached for the proposal in the community, and provide an
analysis that shows the proposal is in practice workable. The
ICG should also compile the input it has received beyond the
operational communities, and review the impacts of this input.
</t><t>
The ICG might at some point detect problems with the component
proposals. At that point the role of the ICG is to communicate
that back to the relevant communities so that they (the
relevant communities) can address the issues. It is not in the
role of the ICG to develop proposals or to select from among
competing proposals.
</t><t>
(iii) Assembling and submitting a complete proposal
</t><t>
The assembly effort involves taking the proposals for the different
components and verifying that the whole fulfills the intended
scope, meets the intended criteria, that there are no missing
parts, and that the whole fits together. The whole also needs
to include sufficient independent accountability mechanisms
for running the IANA function. The ICG will then develop a
draft final proposal that achieves rough consensus within the
ICG itself. The ICG will then put this proposal up for public
comment involving a reasonable period of time for reviewing
the draft proposal, analyzing and preparing supportive or
critical comments. The ICG will then review these comments and
determine whether modifications are required. If no
modifications are needed, and the coordination group agrees,
the proposal will be submitted to NTIA.
</t><t>
If changes are required to fix problems or to achieve broader support,
the ICG will work with the operational communities in a manner
similar to what was described in task (ii) above. Updates are
subject to the same verification, review, and consensus
processes as the initial proposals. If, in the ICG's opinion,
broad public support for the proposal as articulated by the
NTIA is not present, the parts of the proposal that are not
supported return to the liaison phase.
</t><t>
(iv) Information sharing
</t><t>
The ICG serves as a central clearinghouse for public information about
the IANA stewardship transition process. Its secretariat
maintains an independent, publicly accessible and open
website, under its own domain, where status updates, meetings
and notices are announced, proposals are stored, the ICG
members are listed, etc. As the development of the transition
plans will take some time, it is important that information
about ongoing work is distributed early and continuously. This
will enable sharing of ideas and the detection of potential
issues.

Introduction
</t>
<t>
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Under the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG)
Charter, the ICG has four main tasks:

(i) Act as liaison to all interested parties in the IANA 
    stewardship transition, including the three "operational
    communities" (i.e., those with direct operational or service
    relationships with the IANA functions operator; namely names,
    numbers, protocol parameters). This task consists of: 

   a. Soliciting proposals from the operational communities
   b. Soliciting the input of the broad group of communities
      affected by the IANA functions

(ii) Assess the outputs of the three operational communities for
     compatibility and interoperability

(iii) Assemble a complete proposal for the transition 

(iv) Information sharing and public communication

This Request for Proposals (RFP) addresses task (i) of the ICG
Charter. This RFP does not preclude any form of input from the
non-operational communities.

0. Complete Formal Responses

The IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) seeks
complete formal responses to this RFP through processes which are to
be convened by each of the "operational communities" of IANA (i.e.,
those with direct operational or service relationships with the IANA
functions operator, in connection with names, numbers, or protocol
parameters).

Proposals should be supported by the broad range of stakeholders
participating in the proposal development process. Proposals should
be developed through a transparent process that is open to and
inclusive of all stakeholders interested in participating in the
development of the proposal. In order to help the ICG maintain its
light coordination role, all interested and affected parties are
strongly encouraged to participate directly in these community
processes.

The following link provides information about ongoing community
processes and how to participate in them, and that will continue to
be updated over time:

https://www.icann.org/en/stewardship/community

In this RFP, "IANA" refers to the functions currently specified in
the agreement between NTIA and ICANN
[http://www.ntia.doc.gov/page/iana-functions-purchase-order] as well
as any other functions traditionally performed by the IANA functions
operator. SAC-067

[https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-067-en.pdf]
provides one description of the many different meanings of the term
"IANA" and may be useful reading in addition to the documents
constituting the agreement itself.

Communities are asked to adhere to open and inclusive processes in
developing their responses, so that all community members may fully
participate in and observe those processes. Communities are also
asked to actively seek out and encourage wider participation by any
other parties with interest in their response.

A major challenge of the ICG will be to identify and help to
reconcile differences between submitted proposals, in order to
produce a single plan for the transition of IANA
stewardship. Submitted Proposals should therefore focus on those
elements that are considered to be truly essential to the transition
of their specific IANA functions.  The target deadline for all
complete formal responses to this RFP is 15 January 2015.

I. Comments

While the ICG is requesting complete formal proposals through
processes convened by each of the operational communities, and that
all interested parties get involved as early as possible in the
relevant community processes, some parties may choose to provide
comments directly to the ICG about specific aspects of particular
proposals, about the community processes, or about the ICG's own
processes. Comments may be directly submitted to the ICG any time
via email to icg-forum@icann.org. Comments will be publicly archived
at <http://forum.icann.org/lists/icg-forum/>.

Commenters should be aware that ICG will direct comments received to
the relevant operational communities if appropriate. The ICG will
review comments received as time and resources permit and in
accordance with the overall timeline for the transition. That is,
comments received about specific proposals may not be reviewed until
those proposals have been submitted to the ICG. The ICG may
establish defined public comment periods about specific topics in
the future, after the complete formal responses to the RFP have been
received.

Required Proposal Elements

The ICG encourages each community to submit a single proposal that
contains the elements described in this section.

Communities are requested to describe the elements delineated in the
sections below in as much detail possible, and according to the
suggested format/structure, to allow the ICG to more easily
assimilate the results. While each question is narrowly defined to
allow for comparison between answers, respondents are encouraged to
provide further information in explanatory sections, including
descriptive summaries of policies/practices and associated
references to source documents of specific policies/practices. In
this way, the responses to the questionnaire will be useful at the
operational level as well as to the broader stakeholder communities.

In the interest of completeness and consistency, proposals should
cross-reference wherever appropriate the current IANA Functions
Contract[3] when describing existing arrangements and proposing
changes to existing arrangements.

0. Proposal type

Identify which category of the IANA functions this submission
proposes to address:
 [ ] Names [ ] Numbers [ ] Protocol Parameters

I. Description of Community's Use of IANA Functions

This section should list the specific, distinct IANA functions your
community relies on. For each IANA function on which your community
relies, please provide the following:

 o A description of the function;
 o A description of the customer(s) of the function;
 o What registries are involved in providing the function;
 o A description of any overlaps or interdependencies between your
   IANA requirements and the functions required by other customer
   communities. 

If your community relies on any other IANA service or activity
beyond the scope of the IANA functions contract, you may describe
them here. In this case please also describe how the service or
activity should be addressed by the transition plan.

II. Existing, Pre-Transition Arrangements

This section should describe how existing IANA-related arrangements
work, prior to the transition.


[3] http://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/
         publications/sf_26_pg_1-2-final_award_and_sacs.pdf

A. Policy Sources

This section should identify the specific source(s) of policy which
must be followed by the IANA functions operator in its conduct of
the services or activities described above. If there are distinct
sources of policy or policy development for different IANA
functions, then please describe these separately. For each source of
policy or policy development, please provide the following:

 o Which IANA function (identified in Section I) are affected.
 o A description of how policy is developed and established and who
   is involved in policy development and establishment.
 o A description of how disputes about policy are resolved.
 o References to documentation of policy development and dispute
   resolution processes.

B. Oversight and Accountability

This section should describe all the ways in which oversight is
conducted over the IANA functions operator's provision of the
services and activities listed in Section I and all the ways in
which the IANA functions operator is currently held accountable for
the provision of those services. For each oversight or
accountability mechanism, please provide as many of the following as
are applicable:


Which IANA functions (identified in Section I) are affected.  If the
policy sources identified in Section II.A are affected, identify
which ones are affected and explain in what way.

 o A description of the entity or entities that provide oversight or
   perform accountability functions, including how individuals are
   selected or removed from participation in those entities. 
 o A description of the mechanism (e.g., contract, reporting scheme,
   auditing scheme, etc.). This should include a description of the
   consequences of the IANA functions operator not meeting the
   standards established by the mechanism, the extent to which the
   output of the mechanism is transparent and the terms under which
   the mechanism may change.
 o Jurisdiction(s) in which the mechanism applies and the legal basis
   on which the mechanism rests.

III. Proposed Post-Transition Oversight and Accountability
     Arrangements 

This section should describe what changes your community is
proposing to the arrangements listed in Section II.B in light of the
transition. If your community is proposing to replace one or more
existing arrangements with new arrangements, that replacement should
be explained and all of the elements listed in Section II.B should
be described for the new arrangements. Your community should provide
its rationale and justification for the new arrangements.

If your community's proposal carries any implications for the
interface between the IANA functions and existing policy arrangements
described in Section II.A, those implications should be described
here.

If your community is not proposing changes to arrangements listed in
Section II.B, the rationale and justification for that choice should
be provided here.

IV. Transition Implications

This section should describe what your community views as the
implications of the changes it proposed in Section III. These
implications may include some or all of the following, or other
implications specific to your community:

Description of operational requirements to achieve continuity of
service and possible new service integration throughout the
transition.

Risks to operational continuity and how they will be addressed.
Description of any legal framework requirements in the absence of the
NTIA contract. Description of how you have tested or evaluated the
workability of any new technical or operational methods proposed in
this document and how they compare to established arrangements.
Description of how long the proposals in Section III are expected to
take to complete, and any intermediate milestones that may occur
before they are completed.

V. NTIA Requirements

Additionally, NTIA has established that the transition proposal must
meet the following five requirements:
 o Support and enhance the multistakeholder model;
 o Maintain the security, stability, and resiliency of the Internet
   DNS;
 o Meet the needs and expectation of the global customers and
   partners of the IANA functions;
 o Maintain the openness of the Internet;
 o The proposal must not replace the NTIA role with a government-led
   or an inter-governmental organization solution.

This section should explain how your community's proposal meets these
requirements and how it responds to the global interest in the IANA
functions.

VI. Community Process

This section should describe the process your community used for
developing this proposal, including:
 o The steps that were taken to develop the proposal and to determine
   consensus.
 o Links to announcements, agendas, mailing lists, consultations and
   meeting proceedings.
 o An assessment of the level of consensus behind your community's
   proposal, including a description of areas of contention or
   disagreement.

<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>&gt; these aspects of the proposals are perceived as incompatible would</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>&gt; the numbers and protocol parameters communities be willing to </t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>&gt; modify their proposals to reconcile them?</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>We do not observe incompatibilities between the proposals from the</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>numbers and protocol parameters communities. The numbers</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>community expresses a preference to transfer the trademark and</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>domain, while the IETF proposal does not oppose such transfer.</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>This is not an incompatibility, it is something that can be</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>satisfied by implementation of both number and protocol</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>parameters community's proposals, as already specified.</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>To confirm this, and to determine whether the transfer</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>of the trademark and domain would be acceptable,</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>we consulted the community. It is the opinion of the</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>IANAPLAN working group that they would support a</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>decision by the IETF Trust to hold the trademark and domain</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>on behalf of the Internet community. For details, see</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ianaplan/current/msg01659.html</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>The IETF Trust also looked at this issue. The trustees decided that</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>the IETF Trust would be willing to hold intellectual property rights</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>relating to the IANA function, including the IANA trademark and the</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>IANA.ORG domain name. For details, see</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ianaplan/current/msg01664.html</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>In short, we find no incompatibility between the proposals and no</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>need to modify the protocol parameters proposal.</t>

<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>Subject: [Internal-cg] IETF response to the time frame inquiry</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>Date: 5 Jun 2015 13:39:50 GMT+3</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>To: Alissa Cooper &lt;alissa@cooperw.in&gt;</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>Cc: ICG &lt;internal-cg@ianacg.org&gt;</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>This is a response to a query regarding transition finalisation and</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>implementation time frames, sent to the IANAPLAN working</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>group list by the chairs of the IANA Transition Coordination</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>Group (ICG) on May 27th.</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>While I am carrying this response back to the ICG, the substance</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>of this response has been discussed in the IANAPLAN working</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>group and the relevant parts of IETF leadership. I believe this</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>response represents the (rough) consensus opinion that</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>emerged in the discussion, as well as the current state</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>of IANA arrangement updates that our leadership bodies</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>have been working on.</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>The IETF is ready today to take the next steps in the</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>implementation of the transition of the stewardship.</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>In our case, most of the necessary framework is already</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>in place and implemented in preceding years.</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>The remaining step is an updated agreement with</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>ICANN which addresses two issues. These issues are</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>outlined in Section 2.III in the Internet Draft</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>draft-ietf-ianaplan-icg-response-09.txt:</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>o  The protocol parameters registries are in the public domain.  It</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>   is the preference of the IETF community that all relevant parties</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>   acknowledge that fact as part of the transition.</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>o  It is possible in the future that the operation of the protocol</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>   parameters registries may be transitioned from ICANN to subsequent</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>   operator(s).  It is the preference of the IETF community that, as</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>   part of the NTIA transition, ICANN acknowledge that it will carry</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>   out the obligations established under C.7.3 and I.61 of the</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>   current IANA functions contract between ICANN and the NTIA</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>   [NTIA-Contract] to achieve a smooth transition to subsequent</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>   operator(s), should the need arise.  Furthermore, in the event of</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>   a transition it is the expectation of the IETF community that</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>   ICANN, the IETF, and subsequent operator(s) will work together to</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>   minimize disruption in the use of the protocol parameters registries</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>   or other resources currently located at iana.org.</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>The IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) has</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>decided to use an update of our yearly IETF-ICANN Service Level</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>Agreement (SLA) as the mechanism for this updated</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>agreement. They have drafted the update and from our</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>perspective it could be immediately executed. Once the updated</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>agreement is in place, the transition would be substantially</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>complete, with only the NTIA contract lapse or termination</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>as a final step.</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>Of course, we are not alone in this process. Interactions</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>with other parts of the process may bring additional</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>tasks that need to be executed either before or</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>after the transition. First, the ICG, the RIRs,</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>and IETF have discussed the possibility of aligning</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>the treatment of IANA trademarks and domains. The</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>IETF Trust has signalled that it would be willing to do this,</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>if asked. We are awaiting coordination on this</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>to complete, but see no problem in speedy</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>execution once the decision is made. From our</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>perspective this is not a prerequisite for the transition,</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>however.</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>In addition, the names community has proposed the</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>creation of a 'Post Transition IANA' (PTI).  If the existing</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>agreements between the IETF and ICANN remain in place</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>and the SLAs discussed above are not affected, the IETF</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>transition would take place as described above.  That is</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>our preference.  If the final details of the PTI plan require</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>further action from the IETF, more work and community</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>agreement would be required.  The timeline for that work</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>cannot be set until the scope is known.</t>

<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>Date: 8 Oct 2015 10:13:07 GMT+3</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>To: IANA etc etc Coordination Group &lt;internal-cg@ianacg.org&gt;</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t><vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>The IANAPLAN working group has discussed the coordination</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>question from the ICG. In the working group's opinion,</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>informal coordination exists today and will continue, which</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>is consistent with the commitment requested by the ICG.</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>This is also consistent with an overall coordination commitment</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>already indicated in the IANAPLAN proposal. The proposal</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>is a consensus document of the IETF. From the proposal:</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>The IETF will continue to coordinate with ICANN, the RIRs, and other</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>parties that are mutually invested in the continued smooth operation</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>of the Internet registries.</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>The coordination approach is also consistent with the</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>comments that were sent by the IAB to the ICG during the</t>
<t><vspace blankLines="0"/>public comment period. See</t>
