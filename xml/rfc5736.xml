<section title="Introduction">

<t>

This is a direction to <xref target="IANA"/> concerning the creation and management of 
the IANA IPv4 Special Purpose Address Registry. The registry will be 
used for recording IETF protocol assignments from 192.0.0.0/24 and 
any other address prefixes allocated to the registry in the future, as 
described in <xref target="sec_iana_cons"/>.

</t>

</section>

<section title="IANA IPv4 Special Purpose Address Block">

<t>

<xref target="RFC5735"/> records the assignment of an IPv4 address prefix to
IANA for IETF protocol assignments.

<list><t>
192.0.0.0/24 - This block is reserved for IETF protocol assignments.
</t></list>
</t>

<t>
This address allocation to IANA is intended to support IETF
protocol assignments.  A more general view of the roles of IANA
with respect to address allocation functions is documented in
<xref target="RFC2860"/>:

<list><t>
4.3. [...]  Note that [...] (b) assignments of specialised
address blocks (such as multicast or anycast blocks), and (c)
experimental assignments are not considered to be policy issues,
and shall remain subject to the provisions of this Section 4.
(For purposes of this MOU, the term "assignments" includes
allocations.)
</t></list>
</t>

<t>

The reference to Section 4 here is to the general technical work for
the IANA as described in <xref target="RFC2860"/>:

<list><t>
4.1.  The IANA will assign and register Internet protocol
parameters only as directed by the criteria and procedures
specified in RFCs, including Proposed, Draft, and full Internet
Standards and Best Current Practice documents, and any other RFC
that calls for IANA assignment.
</t></list>
</t>

<t>

This document directs IANA to designate special purpose address blocks
in compliance with [RFC2860].

</t>

<t>

This document directs IANA to open an IPv4 Special Purpose Address
Registry for the management of these IANA-designated address blocks.
Special Purpose registrations to be made from this registry include
addresses for IETF protocol assignments and other special purpose cases, 
as documented in IESG-reviewed RFCs, according to the provisions 
described in Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC2860"/>.     

</t>        

</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="sec_iana_cons">

<t>

IANA maintains an "IANA IPv4 Special Purpose Address Registry".  The
registry records current IANA address designations from the
IANA-managed IPv4 Special Purpose address pool. 

</t>

<t>

This recommendation concerns the management of the address pool
used for IETF protocol assignments as documented in
<xref target="RFC5735"/> -- namely, 192.0.0.0/24. Following the
policies outlined in <xref target="RFC5226"/>, further assignments of
address space to IANA for subsequent designation of address prefixes
for the purposes listed here shall be undertaken only through an IETF
Review action.  

</t>

<t>

IANA may make Special Purpose address designations to support testing or 
experimental usage activities initiated by the IETF, or for specialised use 
of a designated address block in a context (e.g., anycast) associated 
with an Internet Standards Track protocol. All such address designations
must be documented in the "IANA Considerations" section of an 
IESG-reviewed RFC.

</t>



<t>

The IANA IPv4 Special Purpose Address Registry records, for all
current address designations undertaken by IANA:

</t>



<t>

        <list style="numbers">

                <t>The designated address prefix.</t>

                <t>The RFC that called for the IANA address designation.</t>

                <t>The date the designation was made.</t>

                <t>The date the use designation is to be terminated (if specified as
                a limited-use designation).</t>

                <t>The nature of the purpose of the designated address (e.g.,
                unicast experiment or protocol service anycast).</t>

                <t>For experimental unicast applications and otherwise as
                        appropriate, the registry will also identify the entity and
                        related contact details to whom the address designation has been
                        made.</t>

                <t>The registry will also note, for each designation, the intended
                        routing scope of the address, indicating whether the address is
                        intended to be routable only in scoped, local, or private
                        contexts, or whether the address prefix is intended to be routed
                        globally.</t>

                <t>The date in the IANA registry is the date of the IANA action,
                        i.e., the day IANA records the allocation.</t>

        </list>

</t>
               
<t>

The IANA registry notes, as a general comment, that address prefixes
listed in the IPv4 Special Purpose Address Registry are not guaranteed
routability in any particular local or global context.

</t>

<t>

IANA will not maintain further sub-registries for any IPv4 Special Purpose
address block designated according to this direction.

</t>

</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>

Security of the Internet's routing system relies on the ability to
authenticate an assertion of unique control of an address block.
Measures to authenticate such assertions rely on validation that the
address block forms part of an existing allocated address block, and
that there is a trustable and unique reference in the IANA address
registries.

</t>

<t>

This  registry is intended to provide an authoritative source
of information regarding the currency and intended purpose of 
IPv4 Special Purpose address blocks that are designated from the IANA-administered IPv4 Special Purpose address pool.  This is a small 
step towards the creation of a comprehensive registry framework that 
can be used as a trust point for commencing a chain of address validation.
Consideration should be given to the use of file signatures and
associated certificate mechanisms to allow applications to confirm
that the registry contents are current, and that they have been
published by the IANA.
