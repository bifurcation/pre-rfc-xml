    <section title="Introduction">
      <section title="Background">
        <t><xref target="RFC3168"/> defines Explicit Congestion
        Notification (ECN) for IP. The primary purpose of ECN is to allow congestion to be
        signalled without dropping packets.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC3270"/> defines how to support the Diffserv
        architecture in MPLS networks, including how to encode Diffserv Code
        Points (DSCPs) in an MPLS header. DSCPs may be encoded in the EXP
        field, while other uses of that field are not precluded. RFC 3270 makes
        no statement about how Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) marking
        might be encoded in the MPLS header.</t>

        <t>This document defines how an operator might define some of the EXP
        codepoints for explicit congestion notification, without precluding
        other uses. In parallel to the activity defining the addition of ECN
        to IP <xref target="RFC3168"/>, two proposals were made to add ECN to
        MPLS <xref target="Floyd"/><xref target="Shayman"/>. These
        proposals, however, fell by the wayside. With ECN for IP now being a
        proposed standard, and developing interest in using pre-congestion
        notification (PCN) for admission control and flow termination <xref target="PCN"/>, there is consequent interest in
        being able to support ECN across IP networks consisting of
        MPLS-enabled domains. Therefore, it is necessary to specify the
        protocol for including ECN in the MPLS shim header and the protocol
        behavior of edge MPLS nodes.</t>

        <t>We note that in <xref target="RFC3168"/>, there are four codepoints
        used for ECN marking, which are encoded using two bits of the IP
        header. The MPLS EXP field is the logical place to encode ECN
        codepoints, but with only 3 bits (8 codepoints) available, and with
        the same field being used to convey DSCP information as well, there is
        a clear incentive to conserve the number of codepoints consumed for
        ECN purposes. Efficient use of the EXP field has been a focus of prior
        documents <xref target="Floyd"/> <xref target="Shayman"/>, and we draw
        on those efforts in this document as well.</t>

        <t>We also note that <xref target="RFC3168"/> defines default usage
        of the ECN field, but it allows for the possibility that some Diffserv
        Per Hop Behaviors (PHBs) might include different specifications on how the ECN field is to
        be used. This document seeks to preserve that capability.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="intent" title="Intent">
        <t>Our intent is to specify how the MPLS shim header <xref target="RFC3032"/> should denote ECN marking and how MPLS nodes
        should understand whether the transport for a packet will be ECN
        capable. We offer this as a building block, from which to build
        different congestion-notification systems. We do not intend to specify
        how the resulting congestion notification is fed back to an upstream
        node that can mitigate congestion. For instance, unlike <xref target="Shayman"/>, we do not specify edge-to-edge MPLS domain
        feedback, but we also do not preclude it. Nonetheless, we do specify
        how the egress node of an MPLS domain should copy congestion
        notification from the MPLS shim into the encapsulated IP header if the
        ECN is to be carried onward towards the IP receiver; but we do *not*
        mandate that MPLS congestion notification must be copied into the IP
        header for onward transmission. This document aims to be generic for any
        use of congestion notification in MPLS. Support of <xref target="RFC3168"/> is our primary motivation; some additional
        potential applications to illustrate the flexibility of our approach
        are described in <xref target="examples"/>. In particular, we aim to
        support possible future schemes that may use more than one level of
        congestion marking.</t>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>This document draws freely on the terminology of ECN <xref target="RFC3168"/> and MPLS <xref target="RFC3031"/>. For ease of
        reference, we have included some definitions here, but refer the
        reader to the references above for complete specifications of the
        relevant technologies:<list style="symbols">
            <t>CE: Congestion Experienced. One of the states with which a
            packet may be marked in a network supporting ECN. A packet is
            marked in this state by an ECN-capable router to indicate that
            this router was experiencing congestion at the time the packet
            arrived.</t>

            <t>ECT: ECN-capable Transport. One of the ECN states that a
            packet may be in when it is sent by an end system. An end system
            marks a packet with an ECT codepoint to indicate that the
            endpoints of the transport protocol are ECN-capable. A router may
            not mark a packet as CE unless the packet was marked ECT when it
            arrived.</t>

    uniform throughout the document? 
    [bsd] Yes, i'll use the hyphen conistently. -->

            <t>Not-ECT: Not ECN-capable transport. An end system marks a
            packet with this codepoint to indicate that the endpoints of the
            transport protocol are not ECN-capable. A congested router cannot
            mark such packets as CE, and thus it can only drop them to indicate
            congestion.</t>

    <section anchor="motive" title="Use of MPLS EXP Field for ECN">
      <t>We propose that LSRs configured for explicit congestion notification
      should use the EXP field in the MPLS shim header. However, <xref target="RFC3270"/> already defines use of codepoints in the EXP field
      for differentiated services. Although it does not preclude other
      compatible uses of the EXP field, this clearly seems to limit the space
      available for ECN, given the field is only 3 bits (8 codepoints).</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC3270"/> defines two possible approaches for
      requesting differentiated service treatment from an LSR:</t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>In the EXP-Inferred-PSC LSP (E-LSP) approach, different codepoints of the EXP field in
          the MPLS shim header are used to indicate the packet's per hop
          behavior (PHB).</t>

          <t>In the Label-Only-Inferred-PSC LSP (L-LSP) approach, an MPLS label is assigned for each PHB
          scheduling class (PSC, as defined in <xref target="RFC3260"/>, so
          that an LSR determines both its forwarding and its scheduling
          behavior from the label.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>If an MPLS domain uses the L-LSP approach, there is likely to be
      space in the EXP field for ECN codepoint(s). Where the E-LSP approach is
      used, codepoint space in the EXP field is likely to be scarce. This
      document focuses on interworking ECN marking with the E-LSP approach, as it
      is the tougher problem. Consequently, the same approach can also be
      applied with L-LSPs.</t>

      <t>We recommend that explicit congestion notification in MPLS should use
      codepoints instead of bits in the EXP field. Since not every PHB will
      necessarily require an associated ECN codepoint, it would be wasteful to
      assign a dedicated bit for ECN. (There may also be cases where a given
      PHB might need more than one ECN-like codepoint; see <xref target="PCN-eg"/> for an example).</t>

      <t>For each PHB that uses ECN marking, we assume one EXP codepoint will
      be defined as not congestion marked (Not-CM), and at least one
      other codepoint will be defined as congestion marked (CM).
      Therefore, each PHB that uses ECN marking will consume at least two EXP
      codepoints, but PHBs that do not use ECN marking will only consume
      one.</t>

      <t>Further, we wish to use minimal space in the MPLS shim header to tell
      interior LSRs whether each packet will be received by an ECN-capable
      transport (ECT). Nonetheless, we must ensure that an endpoint that
      would not understand an ECN mark will not receive one, otherwise it will
      not be able to respond to congestion as it should. In the past, three
      solutions to this problem have been proposed:</t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>One possible approach is for congested LSRs to mark the ECN field
          in the underlying IP header at the bottom of the label stack.
          Although many commercial LSRs routinely access the IP header for
          other reasons (equal cost multi-path - ECMP), there are numerous drawbacks to attempting to
          find an IP header beneath an MPLS label stack. Notably, there is the
          challenge of detecting the absence of an IP header when non-IP
          packets are carried on an LSP. Therefore, we will not consider this
          approach further.</t>

          <t>In the scheme suggested by <xref target="Floyd"/>, ECT and CE are
          overloaded into one bit, so that a 0 means ECT while a 1 might
          either mean Not-ECT or it might mean CE. A packet that has been
          marked as having experienced congestion upstream, and then is picked
          out for marking at a second congested LSR, will be dropped by the
          second LSR since it cannot determine whether the packet has
          previously experienced congestion or if ECN is not supported by the
          transport. <vspace blankLines="1"/> While such an approach seemed
          potentially palatable, we do not recommend it here for the following
          reasons. In some cases, we wish to be able to use ECN marking long
          before actual congestion (e.g., pre-congestion notification). In
          these circumstances, marking rates at each LSR might be
          non-negligible most of the time, so the chances of a previously
          marked packet encountering an LSR that wants to mark it again will
          also be non-negligible. In the case where CE and not-ECT are
          indistinguishable to core routers, such a scenario could lead to
          unacceptable drop rates. If the typical marking rate at every router
          or LSR is p, and the typical diameter of the network of LSRs is d,
          then the probability that a marked packet will be chosen for marking
          more than once is 1-[Pr(never marked) + Pr(marked at exactly one
          hop)] = 1- [(1-p)^d + dp(1-p)^(d-1)]. For instance, with 6 LSRs in a
          row, each marking ECN with 1% probability, the chances of a packet
          that is already marked being chosen for marking a second time is
          0.15%. The bit-overloading scheme would therefore introduce a drop
          rate of 0.15% unnecessarily. Given that most modern core networks
          are sized to introduce near-zero packet drop, it may be unacceptable
          to drop over one in a thousand packets unnecessarily.</t>

          <t>A third possible approach was suggested by <xref target="Shayman"/>. In this scheme, interior LSRs assume that the
          endpoints are ECN-capable, but this assumption is checked when the
          final label is popped. If an interior LSR has marked ECN in the EXP
          field of the shim header, but the IP header says the endpoints are
          not ECN-capable, the edge router (or penultimate router, if using
          penultimate hop popping) drops the packet. We recommend this scheme,
          which we call `per-domain ECT checking', and define it more
          precisely in the following section. Its chief drawback is that it
          can cause packets to be forwarded after encountering congestion only
          to be dropped at the egress of the MPLS domain. The rationale for
          this decision is given in <xref target="non-ecn-mark"/>.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="ect-domain" title="Per-Domain ECT Checking">
      <t>For the purposes of this discussion, we define the egress nodes of an
      MPLS domain as the nodes that pop the last MPLS label from the label
      stack, exposing the IP (or, potentially non-IP) header. Note that such a
      node may be the ultimate or penultimate hop of an LSP, depending on
      whether penultimate hop popping (PHP) is employed.</t>

      <t>In the per-domain ECT checking approach, the egress nodes take
      responsibility for checking whether the transport is ECN-capable. This
      document does not specify how these nodes should pass on congestion
      notification because different approaches are likely in different
      scenarios. However, if congestion notification in the MPLS header is
      copied into the IP header, the procedure MUST conform to the
      specification given here.</t>

      <t>If congestion notification is passed to the transport without first
      passing it onward in the IP header, the approach used must take similar
      care to check that the transport is ECN-capable before passing it ECN
      markings. Specifically, if the transport for a particular congestion
      marked MPLS packet is found not to be ECN-capable, the packet MUST be
      dropped at this egress node.</t>

      <t>In the per-domain ECT checking approach, only the egress nodes check
      whether an IP packet is destined for an ECN-capable transport.
      Therefore, any single LSR within an MPLS domain MUST NOT be configured
      to enable ECN marking unless all the egress LSRs surrounding it are
      already configured to handle ECN marking.</t>

      <t>We call a domain surrounded by ECN-capable egress LSRs an ECN-enabled
      MPLS domain. This term only implies that all the egress LSRs are
      ECN-enabled; some interior LSRs may not be ECN-enabled. For instance, it
      would be possible to use some legacy LSRs incapable of supporting ECN in
      the interior of an MPLS domain as long as all the egress LSRs were
      ECN-capable. Note that if PHP is used, the "penultimate hop" routers
      that perform the pop operation do need to be ECN-enabled since they
      are acting in this context as egress LSRs.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="ecn-spec" title="ECN-Enabled MPLS Domain">
      <t>In the following subsections, we describe various operations affecting
      the ECN marking of a packet that may be performed at MPLS-edge and core
      LSRs.</t>

      <section title=" Pushing (Adding) One or More Labels to an IP Packet">
        <t>On encapsulating an IP packet with an MPLS label stack, the ECN
        field must be translated from the IP packet into the MPLS EXP field.
        The Not-CM (not congestion marked) state is set in the MPLS EXP field
        if the ECN status of the IP packet is Not-ECT or ECT(1) or ECT(0).
        The CM state is set if the ECN status of the IP packet is CE. If
        more than one label is pushed at one time, the same value should be
        placed in the EXP value of all label stack entries.</t>
      </section>
<!--[rfced] Please note the use of "Not ECT" in the paragraph above, 
     while Section 1.3 uses "Not-ECT".  Should these be made uniform
     throughout the document? 
     [bsd] yes, using hyphen through out.-->

      <section anchor="mpls-push" title="Pushing One or More Labels onto an MPLS Labeled Packet">
        <t>The EXP field is copied directly from the topmost label before the
        push to the newly added outer label. If more than one label is being
        pushed, the same EXP value is copied to all label-stack entries.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Congestion Experienced in an Interior MPLS Node">
        <t>If the EXP codepoint of the packet maps to a PHB that uses ECN
        marking, and the marking algorithm requires the packet to be marked,
        the CM state is set (irrespective of whether it is already in the CM
        state).</t>

        <t>If the buffer is full, a packet is dropped.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Crossing a Diffserv Domain Boundary">
        <t>If an MPLS-encapsulated packet crosses a Diffserv domain boundary,
        it may be the case that the two domains use different encodings of the
        same PHB in the EXP field. In such cases, the EXP field must be
        rewritten at the domain boundary. If the PHB is one that supports ECN,
        then the appropriate ECN marking should also be preserved when the EXP
        field is mapped at the boundary.</t>

        <t>If an MPLS-encapsulated packet that is in the CM state crosses from
        a domain that is ECN-enabled (as defined in <xref target="ect-domain"/>) to a domain that is not ECN-enabled, then it
        is necessary to perform the egress checking procedures at the egress
        LSR of the ECN-enabled domain. This means that if the encapsulated
        packet is not ECN-capable, the packet MUST be dropped. Note that this
        implies the egress LSR must be able to look beneath the MPLS header
        without popping the label stack.</t>

        <t>The related issue of Diffserv tunnel models is discussed in <xref target="tunnels"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Popping an MPLS Label (Not the End of the Stack)">
        <t>When a packet has more than one MPLS label in the stack and the top
        label is popped, another MPLS label is exposed. In this case, the ECN
        information should be transferred from the outer EXP field to the
        inner MPLS label in the following manner. If the inner EXP field is
        Not-CM, the inner EXP field is set to the same CM or Not-CM state as
        the outer EXP field. If the inner EXP field is CM, it remains
        unchanged whatever the outer EXP field. Note that an inner value of CM
        and an outer value of not-CM should be considered anomalous, and
        SHOULD be logged in some way by the LSR.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Popping the Last MPLS Label in the Stack">
        <t>When the last MPLS label is popped from the packet, its payload is
        exposed. If that packet is not IP, and does not have any capability
        equivalent to ECT, it is assumed Not-ECT, and it is treated as such. That
        means that if the EXP value of the MPLS header is CM, the packet MUST
        be dropped.</t>

        <t>Assuming an IP packet was exposed, we have to examine
        whether or not that packet is ECT. A Not-ECT packet MUST be dropped if the EXP
        field is CM.</t>

        <t>For the remainder of this section, we describe the behavior that is
        required if the ECN information is to be transferred from the MPLS
        header into the exposed IP header for onward transmission. As noted in
        <xref target="intent"/>, such behavior is not mandated by this

        <t>If the inner IP packet is Not-ECT, its ECN field remains unchanged
        if the EXP field is Not-CM. If the ECN field of the inner packet is
        set to ECT(0), ECT(1), or CE, the ECN field remains unchanged if the
        EXP field is set to Not-CM. The ECN field is set to CE if the EXP
        field is CM. Note that an inner value of CE and an outer value of
        not-CM should be considered anomalous, and SHOULD be logged in some
        way by the LSR.</t>

      <section anchor="tunnels" title="Diffserv Tunneling Models">
        <t><xref target="RFC3270"/> describes three tunneling models for
        Diffserv support across MPLS Domains, referred to as the uniform,
        short pipe, and pipe models. The differences between these models lie
        in whether the Diffserv treatment that applies to a packet while it
        travels along a particular LSP is carried to the ingress of
        the last hop, to the egress of the last hop, or beyond the last hop.
<!--[rfced] The sentence paragraph above may be 
  ambiguous.  Is it the case that the three tunneling models are 
  different because one model doesn't reach the last hop, one does 
  reach it, and one goes beyond it?  Or is it a binary distinction
  between just reaching the last hop and beyond or not reaching it 
  at all?  Does this need clarification or rephrasing? 
  [bsd] It's not that important in this context, but I made it less
        ambiguous by enumerating 3 options -->
        Depending on which mode is preferred by an
        operator, the EXP value or DSCP value of an exposed header following a
        label pop may or may not be dependent on the EXP value of the label
        that is removed by the pop operation. We believe that, in the case of
        ECN marking, the use of these models should only apply to the encoding
        of the Diffserv PHB in the EXP value, and that the choice of codepoint
        for ECN should always be made based on the procedures described above,
        independent of the tunneling model.</t>

    <section title="ECN-Disabled MPLS Domain">
      <t>If ECN is not enabled on all the egress LSRs of a domain, ECN MUST
      NOT be enabled on any LSRs throughout the domain. If congestion is
      experienced on any LSR in an ECN-disabled MPLS domain, packets MUST be
      dropped; they MUST NOT be marked. The exact algorithm for deciding when to drop
      packets during congestion (e.g., tail-drop, RED, etc.) is a local matter
      for the operator of the domain.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="codepoints" title="The Use of More Codepoints with E-LSPs and L-LSPs">
      <t><xref target="RFC3270"/> gives different options with E-LSPs and
      L-LSPs, and some of those could potentially provide ample EXP codepoints
      for ECN. However, deploying L-LSPs vs. E-LSPs has many implications, such
      as platform support and operational complexity. The above ECN MPLS
      solution should provide some flexibility. If the operator has deployed
      one L-LSP per PHB scheduling class, then EXP space will be a non-issue,
      and it could be used to achieve more sophisticated ECN behavior if
      required. If the operator wants to stick to E-LSPs and uses a handful of
      EXP codepoints for Diffserv, it may be desirable to operate with a
      minimum number of extra ECN codepoints, even if this comes with some
      compromise on ECN optimality. See <xref target="examples"/> for
      discussion of some possible deployment scenarios.</t>

      <t>We note that in a network where L-LSPs are used, ECN marking SHOULD
      NOT cause packets from the same microflow, but with different ECN
      markings, to be sent on different LSPs. As discussed in <xref target="RFC3270"/>, packets of a single microflow should always travel
      on the same LSP to avoid possible misordering. Thus, ECN marking of
      packets on L-LSPs SHOULD only affect the EXP value of the packets.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="ecn-tunnel" title="Relationship to Tunnel Behavior in RFC 3168">
      <t><xref target="RFC3168"/> defines two modes of encapsulating
      ECN-marked IP packets inside additional IP headers when tunnels are
      used. The two modes are the "full functionality" and "limited
      functionality" modes. In the full functionality mode, the ECT
      information from the inner header is copied to the outer header at the
      tunnel ingress, but the CE information is not. In the limited
      functionality mode, neither ECT nor CE information is copied to the
      outer header, and thus ECN cannot be applied to the encapsulated
      packet.</t>

      <t>The behavior that is specified in <xref target="ecn-spec"/> of this
      document resembles the "full functionality" mode in the sense that it
      conveys some information from inner to outer header, and in the sense
      that it enables full ECN support along the MPLS LSP (which is analogous
      to an IP tunnel in this context). However it differs in one respect,
      which is that the CE information is conveyed from the inner header to
      the outer header. Our original reason for this different design choice
      was to give interior routers and LSRs more information about upstream
      marking in multi-bottleneck cases. For instance, the flow termination
      marking mechanism proposed for PCN works by only considering packets for
      marking that have not already been marked upstream. Unless existing flow
      termination marking is copied from the inner to the outer header at
      tunnel ingress, the mechanism doesn't terminate enough traffic in cases
      where anomalous events hit multiple domains at once. <xref target="RFC3168"/> does not give any reasons against conveying CE
      information from the inner header to the outer in the "full
      functionality" mode. Furthermore, <xref target="RFC4301"/> specifies
      that the ECN marking should be copied from inner header to outer header
      in IPSEC tunnels, consistent with the approach defined here. <xref target="BRISCOE-ECN"/> discusses this issue in more
      detail. In summary, the approach described in <xref target="ecn-spec"/>
      appears to be both a sound technical choice and consistent with the
      current state of thinking in the IETF.</t>

    <section anchor="deploy" title="Deployment Considerations">
      <section anchor="non-ecn-mark" title="Marking Non-ECN-Capable Packets">
        <t>What are the consequences of marking a packet that is not
        ECN-capable? Even if it will be dropped before leaving the domain,
        doesn't this consume resources unnecessarily?</t>

        <t>The problem only arises if there is congestion downstream of an
        earlier congested queue in the same MPLS domain. Congested
        LSRs downstream might forward packets already marked, even though they will be
        dropped later when the inner IP header is found to be Not-ECT on
        decapsulation. Such packets might cause the downstream LSRs to mark
        (or drop) other packets that they would otherwise not have had to.</t>

        <t>We expect congestion will typically be rare in MPLS networks, but
        it might not be. The extra unnecessary load at downstream LSRs will
        not be more than the fraction of marked packets from upstream LSRs,
        even in the worst case where no transports are ECN-capable. Therefore,
        the amount of unnecessary marking (or drop) on an LSR will not be more
        than the product of its local marking rate and the marking rate due to
        upstream LSRs within the same domain -- typically the product of two
        small (often zero) probabilities.</t>

        <t>This is why we decided to use the per-domain ECT checking
        approach -- because the most likely effect would be a very slightly increased
        marking rate, which would result in very slightly higher drop only for
        non-ECN-capable transports. We chose not to use the <xref target="Floyd"/> alternative, which introduced a low but persistent
        level of unnecessary packet drop for all time, even for ECN-capable
        transports. Although that scheme did not carry traffic to the edge of
        the MPLS domain only to be dropped on decapsulation, we felt our minor
        inefficiency was a small price to pay; and it would get smaller still
        if ECN deployment widened.</t>

        <t>A partial solution would be to preferentially drop packets arriving
        at a congested router that were already marked. There is no solution
        to the problem of marking a packet when congestion is caused by
        another packet that should have been dropped. However, the chance of
        such an occurrence is very low, and the consequences are not
        significant. It merely causes an application to very occasionally slow
        down its rate when it did not have to.</t>

      <section title="Non-ECN-Capable Routers in an MPLS Domain">
        <t>What if an MPLS domain wants to use ECN, but not all legacy routers
        are able to support it?</t>

        <t>If the legacy router(s) are used in the interior, this is not a
        problem. They will simply have to drop the packets if they are
        congested, rather than mark them, which is the standard behavior for
        IP routers that are not ECN-enabled.</t>

        <t>If the legacy router were used as an egress router, it would not be
        able to check the ECN-capability of the transport correctly. An
        operator in this position would not be able to use this solution and
        therefore MUST NOT enable ECN unless all egress routers are
        ECN-capable.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="examples" title="Example Uses">
      <section title="RFC 3168-Style ECN">
        <t><xref target="RFC3168"/> proposes the use of ECN in TCP,
        and it introduces the use of ECN-Echo and Congestion Window Reduced (CWR) flags in the TCP header for
        initialization. The TCP sender responds accordingly (such as not
        increasing the congestion window) when it receives an ECN-Echo (ECE)
        ACK packet (that is, an ACK packet with ECN-Echo flag set in the TCP
        header), then the sender knows that congestion was encountered in the
        network on the path from the sender to the receiver.</t>

        <t>It would be possible to enable ECN in an MPLS domain for Diffserv
        PHBs like AF and best efforts that are expected to be used by TCP and
        similar transports (e.g., DCCP <xref target="RFC4340"/>). Then,
        end-to-end congestion control in transports capable of understanding
        ECN would be able to respond to approaching congestion on LSRs without
        having to rely on packet discard to signal congestion.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="ECN Co-Existence with Diffserv E-LSPs">
        <t>Many operators today have deployed Diffserv using the E-LSP
        approach of <xref target="RFC3270"/>. In many cases, the number of
        PHBs used is less than 8, and hence there remain available codepoints
        in the EXP space. If an operator wished to support ECN for a single PHB,
        this could be accomplished by simply allocating a second codepoint to the
        PHB for the CM state of that PHB and retaining the old codepoint for
        the not-CM state. An operator with only four deployed PHBs could, of
        course, enable ECN marking on all those PHBs. It is easy to imagine
        cases where some PHBs might benefit more from ECN than others -- for
        example, an operator might use ECN on a premium data service but not
        on a PHB used for best-effort Internet traffic.</t>

<!--[rfced] Are the quotes around "CM" and "not-CM" in the paragraph 
            above intentional?  
    [bsd] no, removed -->

        <t>As an illustrative example of how the EXP field might be used in
        this case, consider the example of an operator who is using the
        aggregated service classes proposed in <xref target="TSVWG"/>. He may choose to
        support ECN only for the Assured Elastic Treatment Aggregate, using
        the EXP codepoint 010 for the not-CM state and 011 for the CM state.
        All other codepoints could be the same as in <xref target="TSVWG"/>. Of course, any other
        combination of EXP values can be used according to the specific set of
        PHBs and marking conventions used within that operator's network.</t>

      <section anchor="cbte" title="Congestion-Feedback-Based Traffic Engineering">
        <t>Shayman's traffic engineering <xref target="Shayman"/> presents
        another example application of ECN feedback in an MPLS domain. Shayman
        proposed the use of ECN by an egress LSR feeding back congestion to an
        ingress LSR to mitigate congestion by employing dynamic traffic
        engineering techniques, such as shifting flows to an alternate path. It
        proposed a new Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) message, which was sent by the egress LSR to the
        ingress LSR (and ignored by transit LSRs) to indicate congestion along
        the path. Thus, rather than providing the same style of congestion
        notification to endpoints as defined in <xref target="RFC3168"/>,
        <xref target="Shayman"/> limits its scope to the MPLS domain only.
        This application of ECN in an MPLS domain could make use of the ECN
        encoding in the MPLS header that is defined in this document.</t>

      <section anchor="PCN-eg" title="PCN Flow Admission Control and Flow Termination">
        <t><xref target="PCN"/> proposes using
        pre-congestion notification (PCN) on routers within an edge-to-edge
        Diffserv region to control admission of new flows to the region and,
        if necessary, to terminate existing flows in response to disasters and
        other anomalous routing events. In this approach, the current level of
        PCN marking is picked up by the signaling used to initiate each flow
        in order to inform the admission control decision for the whole region
        at once. For example, extensions to RSVP
        <xref target="LEFAUCHEUR"/> and Next Steps in
        Signaling (NSIS) <xref target="NSIS"/>, <xref target="ARUMAITHURAI"/> have been proposed.</t>

        <t>If LSRs are able to mark packets to signify congestion in MPLS, PCN
        marking could be used for admission control and flow termination
        across a Diffserv region, irrespective of whether it contained pure IP
        routers, MPLS LSRs, or both. Indeed, the solution could be somewhat
        more efficient to implement if aggregates could identify themselves by
        their MPLS label. <xref target="PCN-ext"/> describes the mechanisms
        by which the necessary markings for PCN could be carried in the MPLS
        header.</t>

     <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>We believe no new vulnerabilities are introduced by this document.</t>

      <t>We have considered whether malicious sources might be able to exploit
      the fact that interior LSRs will mark packets that are Not-ECT, relying
      on their egress LSR to drop them. Although this might allow sources to
      engineer a situation where more traffic is carried across an MPLS domain
      than should be, we figured that even if we hadn't introduced this
      feature, these sources would have been able to prevent these LSRs
      dropping this traffic anyway, simply by setting ECT in the first
      place.</t>

      <t>An ECN sender can use the ECN nonce [RFC3540] to detect a
      misbehaving receiver. The ECN nonce works correctly across an
      MPLS domain without requiring any specific support from the
      proposal in this document. The nonce does not need to be present in
      the MPLS shim header to detect a misbehaving receiver. As long as
      the nonce is present in the IP header when the ECN information is
      copied from the last MPLS shim header, it will be overwritten if
      congestion has been experienced by an LSR. This is all that is
      necessary for the sender to detect a misbehaving receiver. If
      there were a need for an ECN nonce in the MPLS shim header (e.g.,
      to detect if one LSR were erasing the markings of an upstream LSR
      in the same domain), we believe this proposal does not preclude
      the later addition of an ECN nonce capability for specific DSCPs,
      just as it does not preclude any other use of the EXP codepoints.</t>

    <appendix anchor="PCN-ext" title="Extension to Pre-Congestion Notification">
      <t>This appendix describes how the mechanisms described in the body of
      the document can be extended to support PCN <xref target="PCN"/>. Our intent here is to show that
      the mechanisms are readily extended to more complex scenarios than ECN,
      particularly in the case where more codepoints are needed, but this
      appendix may be safely ignored if one is interested only in supporting
      ECN. Note that the PCN standards are still very much under development
      at the time of writing; hence, the precise details contained in this
      appendix may be subject to change, and we stress that this appendix is
      for illustrative purposes only.</t>

      <t>The relevant aspects of PCN for the purposes of this discussion
      are:<list style="symbols">
          <t>PCN uses 3 states rather than 2 for ECN -- these are referred to
          as admission marked (AM), termination marked (TM), and not marked
          (NM) states. (See <xref target="PCN-eg"/> for further discussion of
          PCN and the possibility of using fewer codepoints).</t>

          <t>A packet can go from NM to AM, from NM to TM, or from AM to TM,
          but no other transition is possible.</t>

          <t>The determination of whether a packet is subject to PCN is based
          on the PHB of the packet.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Thus, to support PCN fully in an MPLS domain for a particular PHB, a
      total of 3 codepoints need to be allocated for that PHB. These 3
      codepoints represent the admission marked (AM), termination marked (TM),
      and not marked (NM) states. The procedures described in <xref target="ecn-spec"/> above need to be slightly modified to support this
      scenario. The following procedures are invoked when the topmost DSCP or
      EXP value indicates a PHB that supports PCN.</t>

      <appendix title="Label Push onto IP Packet">
        <t>If the IP packet header indicates AM, set the EXP value of all
        entries in the label stack to AM. If the IP packet header indicates
        TM, set the EXP value of all entries in the label stack to TM. For any
        other marking of the IP header, set the EXP value of all entries in
        the label stack to NM.</t>
      </appendix>

      <appendix title="Pushing Additional MPLS Labels">
        <t>The procedures of <xref target="mpls-push"/> apply.</t>
      </appendix>

      <appendix title="Admission Control or Flow Termination Marking Inside MPLS Domain">
        <t>The EXP value can be set to AM or TM according to the same
        procedures as described in <xref target="BRISCOE-CL"/>.
        For the purposes of this document, it does not matter exactly which
        algorithms are used to decide when to set AM or TM; all that matters
        is that if a router would have marked AM (or TM) in the IP header, it
        should set the EXP value in the MPLS header to the AM (or TM)
        codepoint.</t>
      </appendix>

      <appendix title="Popping an MPLS Label (Not End of Stack)">
        <t>When popping an MPLS Label exposes another MPLS label, the AM or TM
        marking should be transferred to the exposed EXP field in the
        following manner:<list style="symbols">
            <t>If the inner EXP value is NM, then it should be set to the same
            marking state as the EXP value of the popped label stack
            entry.</t>

            <t>If the inner EXP value is AM, it should be unchanged if the
            popped EXP value was AM, and it should be set to TM if the popped
            EXP value was TM. If the popped EXP value was NM, this should be
            logged in some way, and the inner EXP value should be
            unchanged.</t>

            <t>If the inner EXP value is TM, it should be unchanged whatever
            the popped EXP value was, but any EXP value other than TM should
            be logged.</t>
          </list></t>
      </appendix>

      <appendix title="Popping the Last MPLS Label to Expose IP Header">
        <t>When popping the last MPLS Label exposes the IP header, there are
        two cases to consider:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>the popping LSR is *not* the egress router of the PCN region, in

            <t>the popping LSR *is* the egress router of the PCN region.</t>
          </list>In the latter case, the behavior of the egress LSR is defined
        in <xref target="PCN"/> and is beyond the scope
        of this document. In the former case, the marking should be
        transferred from the popped MPLS header to the exposed IP header as
        follows:<list style="symbols">
            <t>If the inner IP header value is neither AM nor TM, and the EXP
            value was NM, then the IP header should be unchanged. For any
            other EXP value, the IP header should be set to the same marking
            state as the EXP value of the popped label stack entry.</t>

            <t>If the inner IP header value is AM, it should be unchanged if
            the popped EXP value was AM, and it should be set to TM if the
            popped EXP value was TM. If the popped EXP value was NM, this
            should be logged in some way and the inner IP header value should
            be unchanged.</t>

            <t>If the IP header value is TM, it should be unchanged whatever
            the popped EXP value was, but any EXP value other than TM should
            be logged.</t>

However, Pre-Congestion Notification aims at providing notification before any congestion actually occurs. Pre-Congestion Notification is applied to real-time flows (such as voice, video and multimedia streaming) in DiffServ networks. As described in [CL-DEPLOY], it enables "pre" congestion control through two procedures, flow admission control and flow pre-emption. The draft proposes algorithms that determine when a PCN-enabled router writes Admission Marking and Pre-emption Marking in a packet header, depending on the traffic level. The draft also proposes how to encode these markings. We present simulation results with PCN working in an edge-to-edge scenario using the marking algorithms described. Other marking algorithms will be investigated in the future.</t></abstract>

<title>Layered Encapsulation of Congestion Notification</title>

<abstract><t>This document redefines how the explicit congestion notification (ECN) field of the outer IP header of a tunnel should be constructed. It brings all IP in IP tunnels (v4 or v6) into line with the way IPsec tunnels now construct the ECN field, ensuring that the outer header reveals any congestion experienced so far on the path. It specifies the default ECN tunneling behaviour for any Diffserv per- hop behaviour (PHB), but also gives general principles to guide the design of alternate congestion marking behaviours for specific PHBs and for lower layer congestion notification schemes.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>This document describes an NSIS QoS Model for networks that use the Resource Management in Diffserv (RMD) concept. RMD is a technique for adding admission control and pre-emption function to Differentiated Services (Diffserv) networks. The RMD QoS Model allows devices external to the RMD network to signal reservation requests to edge nodes in the RMD network. The RMD Ingress edge nodes classify the incoming flows into traffic classes and signals resource requests for the corresponding traffic class along the data path to the Egress edge nodes for each flow. Egress nodes reconstitute the original requests and continue forwarding them along the data path towards the final destination. In addition, RMD defines notification functions to indicate overload situations within the domain to the edge nodes.</t></abstract>

<title>NSIS PCN-QoSM: A Quality of Service Model for Pre-Congestion Notification  (PCN)</title>

<date month='September' day='4' year='2007' />

<abstract><t>This document describes a Quality of Service model (QOSM), for networks that support the use of the Controlled load service over a Diffserv cloud using pre-congestion notification. Ths is a technique to perform admission control in a Diffserv network by measuring the congestion level in a domain. New flows are admitted only if the current congestion level is below the allowed threshold. When the controlled load in a domain exceeds a certain threshold, the egress prompts the ingress to pre-empt certain flows. This proposal is based on the proposal made by B.Briscoe et al., for the extension of RSVP to support the Controlled load service over a Diffserv cloud using pre-congestion notification.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>In the core of a high capacity network, service differentiation may still be needed to support applications' utilization of the network. Applications with similar traffic characteristics and performance requirements are mapped into diffserv service classes based on end- to-end behavior requirements of the applications. However, some network segments may be configured in such a way that a single forwarding treatment may satisfy the traffic characteristics and performance requirements of two or more service classes. In these cases, it may be desirable to aggregate two or more diffserv service classes into a single forwarding treatment. This document provides guidelines for the aggregation of diffserv service classes into forwarding treatments.</t></abstract>
