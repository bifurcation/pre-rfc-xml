      This document defines a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace
      for the Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) and a
      Namespace Specific String (NSS) for the Mobile Equipment
      Identity (MEID). The structure of an MEID is 15 hexadecimal
      digits long and is defined in the 3GPP2 to uniquely
      identify each individual mobile equipment (e.g., a handset or
      mobile phone).  The 3GPP2 has a requirement to be able to use an
      MEID as a URN.  This document fulfills that requirement.

<section title="Introduction">
	
<t>


   Mobile equipment that is either a) single-mode 3GPP using only 3GPP
  technology to transmit and receive voice or data or b) dual-mode
  3GPP/3GPP2 using either 3GPP or 3GPP2 technology to transmit and
  receive voice or data has an International Mobile station Equipment
  Identity (IMEI) to identify it.

A URN namespace and an NSS for
	the IMEI are defined in <xref target="RFC7254"/>.  For cases
	where the mobile equipment uses IMEI as an identity for dual-mode 3GPP/3GPP2 access, the IMEI URN as defined in <xref
	target="RFC7254"/> can be used to identify the mobile
	equipment.
</t>

<t>
	However, single-mode 3GPP2 mobile equipment that supports
	only 3GPP2 access technology to transmit and receive voice or
	data has a hexadecimal MEID.  Since there are fundamental
	differences between MEID and IMEI (i.e., in encoding, format,
	and the ownership), <xref target="RFC7254"/> cannot be employed
	to represent the hexadecimal MEID.
</t>


<t>      
	This document specifies a URN namespace for 3GPP2 and an NSS
	for the MEID as per the namespace registration requirement in
	<xref target="RFC8141"/>. 


The structure of an MEID is 15
	hexadecimal digits long and is defined by 3GPP2 (see
	<xref target="S.R0048-A"/>) to uniquely identify each
	individual piece of mobile equipment (e.g., a handset or mobile phone).
	The 3GPP2 has a requirement to be able to use an MEID as a
	URN.  This document fulfills that requirement. The Namespace
	Identifier (NID) '3gpp2' is for identities used in 3GPP2
	networks.  The MEID is managed by the 3GPP2, so this NID is
	managed by the 3GPP2. This specification defines only NSSs
	constructed from MEIDs under the '3gpp2' NID.  These NSSs
	start with "meid:" in order to identify them as such.
	In the future, the 3GPP2 may specify other types of NSSs under the '3gpp2' NID.

</t>	


<t>

   	The MEID is 15 hexadecimal digits long, includes a
   	manufacturer code of 8 hexadecimal digits, and includes the serial
   	number of 6 hexadecimal digits plus a hexadecimal digit as a
   	check digit.

</t>	
<t>

	The manufacturer code identifies the mobile equipment
	manufacturer. A manufacturer can be assigned more than one
	manufacturer code.  The serial number uniquely identifies each
	piece of mobile equipment within the manufacturer code. The check digit
	is used as assurance of integrity in error-prone operations,
	e.g., when used with certain types of readers during inventory-management operations. The check digit is not
	transmitted. Therefore, the first 14 of the 15 hexadecimal
	digits are used for defining the MEID as a URN.

</t>
<t>
   	The information here is meant to be a concise guide for those
   	wishing to use the hexadecimal MEID as a URN.  Nothing in this
   	document should be construed to override <xref
   	target="S.R0048-A"/>, which defines the MEID.

          <t hangText='Purpose:'>The '3gpp2' namespace is used to identify mobile equipment that uses
   technologies defined by the Third Generation Partnership Project 2
   ((3GPP2); initially, such equipment is identified by a URN that embeds
   a Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID) that is 15 hexadecimal digits long
   and unique to each individual piece of mobile equipment (e.g., a handset or
   mobile phone).</t>
          <t hangText='Syntax:'>The identifier is expressed in American Standard Code for Information
   Interchange (ASCII) characters and has a hierarchical expression
   using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) defined in <xref target="RFC5234"/>, as
   follows:


	<figure>
	  <artwork type="abnf"><![CDATA[
   pp2-urn              = "urn:" pp2-NID ":" pp2-NSS
   pp2-NID              = "3gpp2"
   pp2-NSS              = meid-specifier / future-pp2-specifier
   meid-specifier       = "meid:" meidval
   future-pp2-specifier = future-specifier *[ ":" 1*( pchar / "/" )] 
   future-specifier     = 1*pp2-char
   pp2-char             = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / 
                          pct-encoded
   ]]></artwork>
	</figure>

   where 'pchar' and 'pct-encoded' are defined in <xref target="RFC3986"/>.  An NSS for
   the MEID is defined under the '3gpp2' NID.

   The representation of the MEID is a specific number of hexadecimal
   digits, as described in <xref target="S.R0048-A"/>.

   The formal definition of a URN with 'meid' NSS contains one meidval
   with the formal definition according to the following ABNF <xref target="RFC5234"/>:

	<figure>
	  <artwork type="abnf"><![CDATA[   
   meidval           = Manufacturer-Code "-" Serial-Number
   Manufacturer-Code = 8HEX
   Serial-Number     = 6HEX
   HEX               = DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"
   ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
	  </t>
          <t hangText='Assignment:'>The manufacturer code and serial number portions of the MEID are
   permanently stored in the mobile equipment, so they remain persistent
   as long as the mobile equipment exists.  The process for manufacturer
   code and serial number assignment is documented in <xref target="SC.R4002-0"/> and
   the manufacturer code and serial number values once assigned are not
   reassigned to other pieces of mobile equipment.
<vspace/>
   Identifiers in the '3gpp2' namespace are defined and assigned by the
   3GPP2 or an agency appointed by 3GPP2 after ensuring that the URNs to
   be assigned are unique.  Procedures are in place to ensure that each
   MEID is uniquely assigned by the mobile equipment manufacturer so
   that it is guaranteed to uniquely identify that particular piece of mobile
   equipment.</t>
          <t hangText='Security and Privacy:'>See Section 6 of RFC 8464.</t>
          <t hangText='Interoperability:'>Although both the 3GPP2 Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID) and the 3GPP
   International Mobile station Equipment Identity (IMEI) are used to
   identify mobile equipment, they are separate identifiers and are not
   to be confused.
<vspace/>
   Internet implementations will not generally possess MEID identifiers.
   The identifiers generated by such implementations will typically be
   URNs within namespaces other than '3gpp2', and may, depending on
   context, even be non-URN URIs.  Implementations are advised to be
   ready to process URIs other than '3gpp2' namespace URNs, so as to
   aid in interoperability.</t>
          <t hangText='Resolution:'>No resolution is envisioned.</t>
          <t hangText='Documentation:'>Documentation can be found in the following specifications:
<list style="symbols">
   <t>"A URN Namespace for Device Identity and
      Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID)" [RFC8464].</t>

   <t>"3G Mobile Equipment Identifier (MEID) - Stage 1" <xref target="S.R0048-A"/>.</t>

      Expanded UIM Identifier (SF_EUIMID)" <xref target="SC.R4002-0"/>.</t></list></t>
          <t hangText="Additional Information:">Because the syntax of a 3GPP2 Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID)
   differs from that of a 3GPP International Mobile station Equipment
   Identity (IMEI), reuse of the URN specified in RFC 7254 is not
   possible.</t>

	<section title="MEID Format"> 

		<section title="Overview"> 		
			<t>
The MEID format is 15 hexadecimal digits encoded in 8 octets as
defined in <xref target="S.R0048-A"/>. The first 8 hexadecimal
digits constitute the manufacturer code; the next 6 hexadecimal
digits the serial number within the manufacturer code.  The last
hexadecimal digit is a check digit. For more details on the
hexadecimal encoding, see <xref target="sect4.2.5"/>.
		</t>
  </section>

		<section title="Manufacturer Code">

		<t>
	   	The manufacturer code is a value of 8 hexadecimal digits.
	   	The manufacturer code identifies the mobile equipment
	   	manufacturer. The manufacturer code is chosen from a
	   	range of values allocated to the mobile equipment
	   	manufacturer in order to uniquely identify the mobile
	   	equipment.

		</t>

		</section>



		<section title="Serial Number">

		<t>

   		The serial number is a value of 6 hexadecimal digits. The
   		serial number identifies equipment within the
   		manufacturer code.

   		</t>

		</section>


		<section title="Check Digit">

		<t>
		This is a single hexadecimal digit (bits 1-4 of octet
		8), and it is used as assurance of integrity in
		error-prone operations, e.g., when used with certain
		types of readers during inventory management
		operations. The check digit is not transmitted by the
		mobile equipment and is not used in the MEID URN.

		<t>
		The MEID format is 15 hexadecimal digits encoded in 8

		following figure is an abstract representation of a
		hexadecimal-encoded MEID stored in memory (the actual
		storage format in memory is implementation specific).
		In this figure, the most significant digit of the
		manufacturer code is encoded in bits 1-4 of octet
		1. Bits 5-8 of octet 8 are zero-padded, since bits
		1-4 are only needed to encode the check digit. The
		most significant digit of the serial number is encoded
		in the bits 1-4 of octet 5. When MEID is included in a
		cellular signaling message, the check digit is omitted

<section title="IANA Considerations">

	<t>

   		In accordance with BCP 66 <xref target="RFC8141"/>, IANA
		has registered the Formal URN namespace '3gpp2' in the 
		"Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespaces" registry, using the
   		registration template presented in <xref target="sect3"/>.

      </t>

</section>


<section title="Security and Privacy Considerations">

		<t>

   		An MEID is usually printed outside of the box in which a
   		mobile device ships.  The MEID may also be printed
   		under the battery on a mobile device; however, very few
   		devices have removable batteries today.  One can
   		retrieve the MEID via either settings or by dialing
   		*#06#.  Anyone with brief physical access to the
   		mobile device or its box can easily obtain
   		the MEID.  Therefore, MEIDs MUST NOT be used as
   		security capabilities (identifiers whose mere
   		possession grants access).  Unfortunately, there are
   		currently examples of some applications that are
   		using the MEID for authorization.  Also, some service
   		providers' customer service departments have been
   		known to use knowledge of the MEID as "proof" that the
   		caller is the legitimate owner of the mobile device.
   		Both of these are inappropriate uses of the MEID.

		
    		</t>

		<t>

		Since the MEID is permanently assigned to the mobile
		equipment and is not modified when the ownership of
		the mobile equipment changes (even upon a complete
		software reload of the mobile equipment), the MEID URN
		MUST NOT be used as a user identifier or user address
		by an application.  Using the MEID to identify a user
		or as a user address could result in communications
		destined for a previous owner of a device being
		received by the new device owner or could allow the
		new device owner to access information or services
		owned by the previous device owner.
   
    		</t>

  		<t>
	
		Additionally, since the MEID identifies the mobile
		equipment, it potentially could be used to identify
		and track users for the purposes of surveillance and
		call data mining if sent in the clear.

		</t>

  		<t>

   		Since the MEID is personally identifiable information,
   		uses of the MEID URN with IETF protocols require a
   		specification and IETF expert review <xref
   		target="RFC8126"/> in order to ensure that the privacy
   		concerns are appropriately addressed.  Protocols
   		carrying the MEID URN SHOULD, at a minimum, use strongly
   		hop-by-hop encrypted channels, and it is
   		RECOMMENDED that end-to-end encryption be used.
