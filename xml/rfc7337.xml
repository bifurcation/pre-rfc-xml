    <abstract>
      <t>Content delivery is frequently provided by specifically architected
      and provisioned Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). As a result of
      significant growth in content delivered over IP networks, existing CDN
      providers are scaling up their infrastructure. Many Network Service
      Providers (NSPs) and Enterprise Service Providers (ESPs) are also deploying their own
      CDNs. To deliver contents from the Content Service Provider (CSP) to end
      users, the contents may traverse across multiple CDNs. This creates a
      need for interconnecting (previously) standalone CDNs so that they can
      collectively act as a single delivery platform from the CSP to the end
      users.</t>

      <t>The goal of the present document is to outline the requirements for
      the solution and interfaces to be specified by the CDNI working
      group.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The volume of video and multimedia content delivered over the
      Internet is rapidly increasing and expected to continue doing so in the
      future. In the face of this growth, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
      provide numerous benefits: reduced delivery cost for cacheable content,
      improved quality of experience for end users, and increased robustness
      of delivery. For these reasons, CDNs are frequently used for large-scale
      content delivery. As a result of the significant growth in content
      delivered over IP networks, existing CDN providers are scaling up their
      infrastructure and many NSPs and ESPs are deploying their own CDNs. Subject to the policy of the
      Content Service Provider (CSP), it is generally desirable that a given
      item of content can be delivered to an end user regardless of that end
      user's location or attachment network. This creates a need for
      interconnecting (previously) standalone CDNs so they can interoperate
      and collectively behave as a single delivery infrastructure. The Content
      Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) working group has been
      chartered to develop an interoperable and scalable solution for such CDN
      interconnections.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC6707">The CDNI Problem Statement</xref> outlines the
      problem area that the CDNI working group is chartered to address. The <xref
      target="RFC6770">Use Cases for CDNI document</xref> discusses the use cases for
      CDN Interconnection. <xref target="RFC7336">The Framework
      for CDN Interconnection</xref> discusses the technology framework for
      the CDNI solution and interfaces.</t>

      <t>The goal of the present document is to document the requirements for
      the CDNI solution and interfaces. In order to meet the timelines defined
      in the working group charter, the present document categorizes the CDNI
      requirements as "High Priority", "Medium Priority", and "Low
      Priority".</t>

      <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
        <t>This document uses the terminology defined in <xref
        target="RFC6707"/>. In addition, the key words "High Priority",
        "Medium Priority", and "Low Priority" in this document are to be
        interpreted as follows:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>"High Priority": When a requirement is tagged as "{HIGH}", it
            is considered by the working group as an essential function for
            CDNI and necessary to a deployable solution. This requirement has
            to be met even if it causes a delay in the delivery by the working
            group of a deployable solution.</t>

            <t>"Medium Priority": When a requirement is tagged as "{MED}", it
            is considered by the working group as an important function for
            CDNI. This requirement has to be met, unless it is established
            that attempting to meet this requirement would cause a delay in
            the delivery by the working group of a deployable solution.</t>

            <t>"Low Priority": When a requirement is tagged as "{LOW}", it is
            considered by the working group as a useful function for CDNI. The
            working group will attempt to meet this requirement as long as it
            does not prevent meeting the "High Priority" and "Medium Priority"
            requirements and does not cause a delay in the delivery by the
            working group of a deployable solution.</t>

    <section anchor="cdni-interfaces" title="CDNI Model and CDNI Interfaces">
      <t>The "CDNI Expanded Model and CDNI Interfaces" figure and brief
      descriptions of the CDNI interfaces in <xref
      target="RFC7336"/> are replicated below for convenience.
      That document contains the definitive reference model and descriptions
      for the CDNI interfaces.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>CDNI Control interface (CI): Operations to bootstrap and
          parameterize the other CDNI interfaces, as well as operations to
          pre-position, revalidate, and purge both metadata and content. The
          latter subset of operations is sometimes collectively called the
          "Trigger interface."</t>

          <t>CDNI Request Routing interface: Operations to determine what CDN
          (and optionally what Surrogate within a CDN) is to serve end-user's
          requests. This interface is actually a logical bundling of two
          separate but related interfaces: <list style="symbols">
              <t>CDNI Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement interface
              (FCI): Asynchronous operations (as defined in <xref
              target="RFC7336"/>) to exchange routing
              information (e.g., the network footprint and capabilities served
              by a given CDN) that enables CDN selection for subsequent user
              requests; and</t>

              <t>CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface (RI): Synchronous
              operations (as defined in <xref
              target="RFC7336"/>) to select a delivery CDN
              (Surrogate) for a given user request.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>CDNI Metadata interface (MI): Operations to communicate metadata
          that governs how the content is delivered by interconnected CDNs.
          Examples of CDNI Metadata include geo-blocking directives,
          availability windows, access control mechanisms, and purge
          directives. It may include a combination of: <list style="symbols">
              <t>Asynchronous operations to exchange metadata that govern
              subsequent user requests for content; and</t>

              <t>Synchronous operations that govern behavior for a given user
              request for content.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>CDNI Logging interface (LI): Operations that allow interconnected
          CDNs to exchange relevant activity logs. It may include a
          combination of: <list style="symbols">
              <t>Real-time exchanges, suitable for runtime traffic monitoring;
              and</t>

              <t>Offline exchanges, suitable for analytics and billing.</t>

    <section title="Generic CDNI Requirements">
      <t>This section identifies generic requirements independent of the
      individual CDNI interfaces. Some of those are expected to affect
      multiple or all interfaces. Management is an important aspect of CDN
      operation. The fault and performance management is covered in CDNI
      Logging interface requirements. The other types of management are
      specific to the CDN provider and not needed for interoperability between
      CDN providers.</t>

      <t><list counter="gen-reqs" style="format GEN-%d">
          <t>{MED} Wherever possible, the CDNI interfaces should reuse or
          leverage existing IETF protocols.</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI solution shall not require a change, or an
          upgrade, to the User Agent to benefit from content delivery through
          interconnected CDNs.</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI solution shall not require a change, or an
          upgrade, to the Content Service Provider delivering content through
          a single CDN, to benefit from content delivery through
          interconnected CDNs.</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI solution shall not depend on intra-CDN
          information to be exposed to other CDNs for effective and efficient
          delivery of the content. Examples of intra-CDN information include
          Surrogate topology, Surrogate status, cached content, etc.</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI solution shall support CDN interconnection when
          delivery to the User Agent is based on <xref
          target="RFC7230">HTTP</xref>. (Note that while delivery and
          acquisition "data plane" protocols are out of the CDNI solution
          scope, the CDNI solution "control plane" protocols are expected to
          participate in enabling, selecting or facilitating operations of
          such acquisition and delivery protocols. Hence, it is useful to state
          requirements on the CDNI solution in terms of specifying which
          acquisition and delivery protocols are to be supported).</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI solution shall support acquisition across CDNs
          based on <xref target="RFC7230">HTTP</xref>. (The note above applies
          to this requirement, too.)</t>

          <t>{LOW} The CDNI solution may support delivery to the User Agent
          based on protocols other than HTTP.</t>

          <t>{LOW} The CDNI solution may support acquisition across CDNs based
          on protocols other than HTTP.</t>

          <t>{MED} The CDNI solution should support cascaded CDN redirection
          (CDN1 redirects to CDN2 that redirects to CDN3) to an arbitrary
          number of levels beyond the first level.</t>

          <t>{MED} The CDNI solution should support an arbitrary topology of
          interconnected CDNs (i.e., the topology of interconnected CDNs cannot
          be restricted to a tree, ring, star, etc.).</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI solution shall prevent looping of any CDNI
          information exchange.</t>

          <t>{HIGH} When making use of third-party reference, the CDNI
          solution shall consider the potential issues associated with the use
          of various format of third-party references (e.g., NAT or IPv4/IPv6
          translation potentially breaking third-party references based on an
          IP addresses such as URI containing IPv4 or IPv6 address literals,
          split DNS situations potentially breaking third-party references
          based on DNS FQDNs) and wherever possible
          avoid, minimize or mitigate the associated risks based on the
          specifics of the environments where the reference is used (e.g.,
          likely or unlikely presence of NAT in the path). 

In particular, this
          applies to situations where the CDNI solution needs to construct and
          convey uniform resource identifiers for directing/redirecting a
          content request, as well as to situations where the CDNI solution
          needs to pass on a third-party reference (e.g., identify the IP
          address of a User Agent) in order to allow another entity to make a
          more informed decision (e.g., make a more informed request routing
          decision by attempting to derive location information from the third-party reference).</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI solution shall support HTTP Adaptive Streaming
          content.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="CDNI Control Interface Requirements">
      <t>The primary purpose of the CDNI Control interface (CI) is to initiate
      the interconnection across CDNs, bootstrap the other CDNI interfaces and
      trigger actions into the Downstream CDN by the Upstream CDN (such as
      delete object from caches or trigger pre-positioned content
      acquisition). The working group attempts to align requirements with the
      appropriate interface; however, solutions to these requirements may
      apply to a different interface or another interface in addition to the
      interface with which it is associated.</t>

      <t><list counter="control-reqs" style="format CI-%d">
          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Control interface shall allow the Upstream CDN to
          request that the Downstream CDN, including cascaded Downstream CDNs,
          delete an object or set of objects and/or its CDNI Metadata from the
          CDN Surrogates and any storage. Only the object(s) and CDNI Metadata
          that pertain to the requesting Upstream CDN are allowed to be
          purged.</t>

          <t>{MED} The CDNI Control interface should allow for multiple
          content items identified by a Content Collection ID to be purged
          using a single Content Purge action.</t>

          <t>{MED} The CDNI Control interface should allow the Upstream CDN to
          request that the Downstream CDN, including cascaded Downstream CDNs,
          mark an object or set of objects and/or its CDNI Metadata as
          "stale" and revalidate them before they are delivered
          again.</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Control interface shall allow the Downstream CDN
          to report on the completion of these actions (by itself, and
          including cascaded Downstream CDNs), in a manner appropriate for the
          action (e.g., synchronously or asynchronously). The confirmation
          receipt should include a success or failure indication. The failure
          indication and the reason are included if the Downstream CDN cannot
          delete the content in its storage.</t>

          <t>{MED} The CDNI Control interface should support initiation and
          control by the Upstream CDN of pre-positioned CDNI Metadata
          acquisition by the Downstream CDN.</t>

          <t>{MED} The CDNI Control interface should support initiation and
          control by the Upstream CDN of pre-positioned content acquisition by
          the Downstream CDN.</t>

          <t>{LOW} The CDNI Control interface may allow a CDN to establish,
          update and terminate a CDN interconnection with another CDN whereby
          one CDN can act as a Downstream CDN for the other CDN (that acts as
          an Upstream CDN).</t>

          <t>{LOW} The CDNI Control interface may allow control of the CDNI
          interfaces between any two CDNs independently for each direction
          (e.g., for the direction where CDN1 is the Upstream CDN and CDN2 is
          the Downstream CDN, and for the direction where CDN2 is the Upstream
          CDN and CDN1 is the Downstream CDN).</t>

          <t>{LOW} The CDNI Control interface may allow bootstrapping of the
          CDNI Request Routing interface. For example, this can potentially
          include:<list style="symbols">
              <t>negotiation of the request routing method (e.g., DNS versus HTTP,
              if more than one method is specified).</t>

              <t>discovery of the CDNI Request Routing interface endpoints.</t>

              <t>information necessary to establish secure communication
              between the CDNI Request Routing interface endpoints.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>{LOW} The CDNI Control interface may allow bootstrapping of the
          CDNI Metadata interface. This information could, for example,
          include:<list style="symbols">
              <t>discovery of the CDNI Metadata interface endpoints</t>

              <t>information necessary to establish secure communication
              between the CDNI Metadata interface endpoints.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>{LOW} The CDNI Control interface may allow bootstrapping of the
          Content Acquisition interface. This could, for example, include
          exchange and negotiation of the Content Acquisition methods to be
          used across the CDNs (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, ATIS C2 <xref
          target="ATIS-0800042"/>).</t>

          <t>{LOW} The CDNI Control interface may allow bootstrapping of the
          CDNI Logging interface. This information could, for example,
          include:<list style="symbols">
              <t>discovery of the CDNI Logging interface endpoints.</t>

              <t>information necessary to establish secure communication
              between the CDNI Logging interface endpoints.</t>

              <t>negotiation/definition of the log file format and set of
              fields to be exported through the logging protocol, with some

          a mechanism allowing an Upstream CDN to avoid redirecting a request
          to a Downstream CDN if that is likely to result in the total
          redirection time exceeding some limit.</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface shall allow
          the Upstream CDN to include, in the query to the Downstream CDN, the

          the Upstream CDN to use the information conveyed by the Downstream
          CDN during the Recursive Request Routing process to rewrite an HTTP

          policy. This information can be taken into account by the Upstream
          CDN Request Routing system in its CDN Selection decisions. This

    <section title="CDNI Metadata Interface Requirements">
      <t>The primary function of the CDNI Metadata interface (MI) is to allow
      the Distribution system in interconnected CDNs to communicate to ensure
      Content Distribution Metadata with inter-CDN scope can be exchanged
      across CDNs. We observe that while the CDNI Metadata Distribution
      protocol is currently discussed as a single "protocol", further analysis
      will determine whether the corresponding requirements are to be realized
      over a single interface and protocol, or over multiple interfaces and
      protocols. For example, a subset of the CDNI Metadata might be conveyed
      in-band along with the actual content acquisition across CDNs (e.g.
      content MD5 in HTTP header) while another subset might require an
      out-of-band interface and protocol (e.g., geo-blocking
      information).</t>

      <t><list counter="meta-reqs"  style="format MI-%d">
          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Metadata interface shall allow the Upstream CDN
          to provide the Downstream CDN with content distribution metadata of
          inter-CDN scope.</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Metadata interface shall support exchange of CDNI
          Metadata for both the dynamic content acquisition model and the
          pre-positioning content acquisition model.</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Metadata interface shall support a mode where no,
          or a subset of, the CDNI Metadata is initially communicated to the
          Downstream CDN along with information about how/where to acquire the
          rest of the CDNI Metadata (i.e., Dynamic CDNI Metadata
          acquisition).</t>

          <t>{MED} The CDNI Metadata interface should support a mode where all
          the relevant CDNI Metadata is initially communicated to the Downstream
          CDN (i.e., pre-positioned CDNI Metadata acquisition).</t>

          <t>{HIGH} Whether in the pre-positioned content acquisition model or
          in the dynamic content acquisition model, the CDNI Metadata
          interface shall provide the necessary information to allow the
          Downstream CDN to acquire the content from an upstream source (e.g.,
          acquisition protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier in Upstream
          CDN -- or rules to construct this URI).</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Metadata shall allow signaling of one or more
          upstream sources, where each upstream source can be in the Upstream
          CDN, in another CDN, the CSP origin server or any arbitrary source
          designated by the Upstream CDN. Note that some upstream sources
          (e.g., the content origin server) may or may not be willing to serve
          the content to the Downstream CDN; if this policy is known to the
          Upstream CDN, then it may omit those sources when exchanging CDNI
          Metadata.</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Metadata interface (possibly in conjunction with
          the CDNI Control interface) shall allow the Upstream CDN to request
          addition and modification of CDNI Metadata into the Downstream
          CDN.</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Metadata interface (possibly in conjunction with
          the CDNI Control interface) shall allow removal of obsolete CDNI
          Metadata from the Downstream CDN (this could, for example, be
          achieved via an explicit removal request from the Upstream CDN or
          via expiration of a Time-To-Live (TTL) associated with the CDNI Metadata).</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Metadata interface shall allow association of
          CDNI Metadata at the granularity of individual object. This is
          necessary to achieve fine-grain CDNI Metadata distribution at the level
          of an individual object when necessary.</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Metadata interface shall allow association of
          CDNI Metadata at the granularity of an object set. This is necessary
          to achieve scalable distribution of metadata when a large number of
          objects share the same distribution policy.</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Metadata interface shall support multiple levels
          of inheritance with precedence to more specific metadata. For
          example, the CDNI Metadata Distribution protocol may support
          metadata that is applicable to any content, metadata that is
          applicable to a content collection and metadata that is applicable
          to an individual content where content level metadata overrides
          content collection metadata that overrides metadata for any
          content.</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Metadata interface shall ensure that conflicting
          metadata with overlapping scope are prevented or deterministically
          handled.</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Metadata interface shall allow signaling of
          content distribution control policies. For example, this could
          potentially include:<list style="symbols">
              <t>geo-blocking information (i.e., information defining
              geographical areas where the content is to be made available or
              blocked).</t>

              <t>availability windows (i.e., information defining time windows
              during which the content is to be made available or blocked;
              expiration time may also be included to remove content).</t>

              <t>delegation whitelist/blacklist (i.e., information defining
              through which Downstream CDNs the content may/may not be delivered)</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Metadata interface shall be able to exchange a
          set of metadata elements with specified semantics (e.g., start of
          time window, end of time window).</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Metadata interface shall allow exchange of opaque
          metadata element, whose semantic is not defined in CDNI but
          established by private CDN agreement.</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Metadata interface shall allow signaling of
          authorization checks and validation that are to be performed by the
          Surrogate before delivery. For example, this could potentially
          include the need to validate information (e.g., Expiry time, Client
          IP address) required for access authorization.</t>

          <t>{MED} The CDNI Metadata interface should allow signaling of
          CDNI-relevant Surrogate cache behavior parameters. For example, this
          could potentially include:<list style="symbols">
              <t>control of whether the query string of HTTP URI is to be
              ignored by Surrogate cache.</t>

              <t>enforcement of caching directives by Downstream CDN that are
              different than the ones signaled in the HTTP headers (e.g.,
              "Expires" field).</t>

              <t>rate-pacing by Downstream CDN for content delivery (e.g.,
              Progressive Download).</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Metadata interface shall provide indication of
          related content (e.g., HTTP Adaptive Bit Rate chunks) by the Content
          Collection ID (CCID) metadata. This could be used by the Downstream
          CDN for operations on the group of content. For example, this could
          potentially include: <list style="symbols">
              <t>content acquisition for the entire set of files when one
              piece of content is requested.</t>

              <t>local file management and storage bundles all the files for
              the content.</t>

              <t>purging the entire set of files associated with the

              <t>logging of the delivery of the content for the session when
              at least one file in the set was delivered.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>{MED} The CDNI Metadata interface should support an optional
          mechanism allowing the Upstream CDN to indicate to the Downstream
          CDN which CDNI Log fields are to be provided for all content items,
          for specific sets of content items, or for specific content items
          delivered using HTTP. A CDNI implementation that does not support
          this optional CDNI Metadata Distribution interface mechanism shall
          ignore this log format indication and generate CDNI Logging format
          for HTTP Adaptive Streaming using the default set of CDNI Logging
          fields. (Note: This function may be part of the CDNI Metadata
          interface or the CDNI Control interface.)</t>

          <t>{MED} The CDNI Metadata interface should allow the Upstream CDN
          to signal to the Downstream CDN the Content Collection ID value for
          all, for specific sets of, or for specific content items delivered
          using HTTP. Whenever the Downstream CDN is instructed by the
          Upstream CDN to report the Content Collection ID field in the log
          records, the Downstream CDN is to use the value provided through the
          CDNI Metadata interface for the corresponding content. Note the
          Session ID field along with Content Collection ID may be used for
          HTTP Adaptive Streaming content.</t>

          <t>{MED} The CDNI Metadata interface should allow the Upstream CDN
          to signal to the Downstream CDN the Authorization Group ID value for
          all the related HTTP Adaptive Streaming content (i.e., manifest file
          and chunks). The authorization result of a content (e.g., manifest
          file) is transferred over to related content (e.g., chunks).</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Metadata interface shall support extensible
          format for CDNI Metadata delivery from the Upstream CDN to the
          Downstream CDN.</t>

          <t>{LOW} The CDNI Logging interface may support aggregate/
          summarized logs (e.g., total bytes delivered for a content regardless
          of individual User Agents to which it was delivered).</t>

          <t>{LOW} The CDNI Logging interface may support logging of
          performance data for deliveries to User Agents performed by the
          Downstream CDN as a result of request redirection by the Upstream
          CDN. Performance data may include various traffic statistics (the
          specific parameters are to be determined). The CDNI Logging
          interface may support the Upstream CDN to indicate the nature and
          contents of the performance data to be reported by the Downstream
          CDN.</t>

          <t>{MED} The CDNI Logging interface should support logging of
          consumed resources (e.g., storage, bandwidth) to the Upstream CDN for
          deliveries where content is stored by the Downstream CDN for
          delivery to User Agents. The information logged may include the type
          of storage (e.g., Origin, Intermediate, Edge, Cache) as well as the
          amount of storage (e.g., total GB, GB used, per time period, per
          content domain) all of which may impact the cost of the
          services.</t>

          <t>{MED} In the case of cascaded CDNs, the CDNI Logging interface
          should support the Downstream CDN to report consumed resources (e.g.
          storage, bandwidth) to the Upstream CDN where content is stored by
          the Downstream CDN itself as well as logging for storage resources
          when content storage is performed by cascaded CDNs on behalf of the
          Downstream CDN.</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Logging interface shall support logging of
          deleted objects from the Downstream CDN to the Upstream CDN as a
          result of explicit delete requests on via the CDNI Control interface
          from the Upstream CDN.</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Logging interface shall support the exchange of
          extensible log file formats to support proprietary information
          fields. These information fields shall be agreed upon ahead of time
          between the corresponding CDNs.</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI Logging interface shall allow a CDN to notify
          another CDN about which CDNI Logging information is available for
          transfer and/or no longer available (e.g., it exceeded some logging
          retention period or some logging retention volume).</t>

          <t>{MED} The CDNI Logging interface should support the ability for
          the Downstream CDN to include the Content Collection ID and Session
          ID fields in CDNI log entries generated for HTTP Adaptive Streaming
          content.</t>

          <t>{MED} The CDNI Logging interface should provide privacy
          protection by not disclosing information that can be used to
          identify the user (e.g., method that anonymizes the IP address
          carried in the logging field). The use of the privacy protection
          mechanism is optional.</t>

    <section anchor="sec" title="CDNI Security Requirements">
      <t>This section identifies the requirements related to the CDNI
      security. Some of these are expected to affect multiple or all
      protocols.</t>

      <t><list counter="sec-reqs"  style="format SEC-%d">
          <t>{HIGH} All the CDNI interface shall support secure operation over
          unsecured IP connectivity (e.g., the Internet). This includes
          authentication, confidentiality, integrity protection as well as
          protection against spoofing and replay.</t>

          <t>{HIGH} The CDNI solution shall provide sufficient protection
          against denial-of-service attacks. This includes protection against
          spoofed delivery requests sent by User Agents directly to a
          Downstream CDN attempting to appear as if they had been redirected
          by a given Upstream CDN when they have not.</t>

          <t>{MED} The CDNI solution should be able to ensure that for any
          given request redirected to a Downstream CDN, the Downstream CDN can
          determine the Upstream CDN that redirected the request directly to
          the Downstream CDN (leading to that request being served by that
          CDN, or being further redirected).</t>

          <t>{MED} The CDNI solution should be able to ensure that for any
          given transaction log generated by the Downstream CDN and
          communicated to an Upstream CDN, the Upstream CDN can confirm the
          transmitted log record corresponds to a request redirection by the
          Upstream CDN.</t>

          <t>{LOW} The CDNI solution may provide a mechanism allowing an
          Upstream CDN that has credentials to acquire content from the CSP
          origin server (or another CDN), to allow establishment of
          credentials authorizing the Downstream CDN to acquire the content
          from the CSP origin server (or the other CDN) (e.g., in case the
          content cannot be acquired from the Upstream CDN).</t>
