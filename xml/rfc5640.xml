    <abstract>
      <t>
   Payloads transported over a Softwire mesh service (as defined by BGP
   Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI)
   information exchange) often carry a number of identifiable,
   distinct flows.

   It can, in some circumstances, be desirable
   to distribute these flows over the equal cost multiple
   paths (ECMPs) that exist in the packet switched network. Currently,
   the payload of a packet entering the Softwire can only
   be interpreted by the ingress and egress routers. Thus, the
   load-balancing decision of a core router is only based on the encapsulating
   header, presenting much less entropy than available in the payload or
   the encapsulated header since the Softwire encapsulation acts in a
   tunneling fashion. This document describes a method for achieving
   comparable load-balancing efficiency in a network carrying Softwire
   mesh service over Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3) 
   over IP or Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) encapsulation to 
   what would be achieved without such encapsulation.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
Consider the case of a router R1 that encapsulates a packet P into a 
Softwire bound to router R3. R2 is a router on the shortest path from R1 
to R3. R2's shortest path to R3 involves equal cost multiple
paths (ECMPs). The goal is for R2 to be able to choose which path to use on the 
basis of the full entropy of packet P.
</t><t>
This is achieved by carrying in the encapsulation header a signature 
of the inner header, hence enhancing the entropy of the flows as seen by 
the core routers. The signature is carried as part of one of the fields of
the encapsulation header. To aid with better description in the document, 
we define the generic term "load-balancing field" to mean such a value 
that is specific to an encapsulation type. For example, for L2TPv3-over-IP <xref
target="RFC3931"></xref>
encapsulation, the load-balancing field is the Session Identifier
(Session ID). For GRE <xref target="RFC2784"></xref> encapsulation,
the Key field <xref target="RFC2890"></xref>, if present, represents 
the load-balancing field. This mechanism
assumes that core routers base their load-balancing 
decisions on a flow definition that includes the load-balancing field.
This is an obvious and generic functionality as, for example, for
L2TPv3-over-IP tunnels, the Session ID is at the same 
well-known constant offset as the TCP/UDP ports in the encapsulating header.
</t><t>
The Encapsulation SAFI <xref target="RFC5512"></xref>
is extended such that a contiguous 
block of the load-balancing field is bound to the Softwire advertised 
by a BGP next-hop. On a per-inner-flow basis, the ingress Provider
Edge (PE) selects one 
value of the load-balancing field from the 
block to preserve per-flow ordering and, at the same time, to enhance the 
entropy across flows.
</t>

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

    <section anchor="sub_tlv" title="Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV">
<t>
This document defines a new sub-TLV for use with the Tunnel Encapsulation 
Attribute defined in <xref target="RFC5512"></xref>. 
The new sub-TLV is referred to as the 
"Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV" and MAY be included in any Encapsulation 
SAFI UPDATE message where load-balancing is desired.
</t>
<t>
The sub-TLV type of the Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV is 5. The sub-TLV 
length is 2 octets. The value represents the length of the block in bits 
and MUST NOT exceed the size of the load-balancing field. This format 
is very similar to the variable-length subnet masking (VLSM) used in IP
 addresses to allow arbitrary length prefixes. The block is determined 
by extracting the initial sequence of 'block size' bits from the
load-balancing field.
</t>
<t>
	If a load-balancing field is not signaled (e.g., if the
        encapsulation sub-TLV is not included in an advertisement
	as in the case of GRE without a Key), then the
	Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV MUST NOT be included.
</t>
<t>
The smaller the value field of the Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV, the
larger the space for per-flow identification, and hence the better
entropy for potential load-balancing in the core, as well as, the lower
the polarization when mapping flows to ECMP paths.  However, reducing
the load-balancing block size consumes more
L2TPv3 Session IDs or GRE Keys, resulting in
potentially less numbers of supported services. A typical deployment
would need to arbitrate between this trade-off.
</t>
<t>
As an example, assume that there is a Softwire set up between R1 and R3
 with L2TPv3-over-IP tunnel type. Assume that R3 encodes the Session ID 
with value 0x1234ABCD in the encapsulation sub-TLV. It also includes the 
Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV 

and encodes the value 24. This should be 
interpreted as follows:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
If an ingress router does not understand the Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV, 
it continues to use the Session ID 0x1234ABCD and encapsulates all packets 
with that Session ID.
</t>
<t>
If an ingress router understands the Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV, it picks 
the first 24 bits out of the Session ID (0x1234AB) to be used as the block 
and fills in the lower-order 8 bits with a per-flow identifier (e.g., it 
can be determined based on the inner packet's source, destination 
addresses, and TCP/UDP ports). This selection preserves the per-flow ordering
of packets.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
This requirement and solution applies equally to GRE where the Key plays the 
same role as the Session ID in L2TPv3.
</t>
<t>
Needless to say, if an egress router does not support the Load-Balancing
Block sub-TLV, the Softwire continues to operate with a single 
load-balancing field with which all ingress routers encapsulate.
</t>
<section anchor="Applicability" title="Applicability to Tunnel Types">
<t>
The Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV is applicable to tunnel types that
define a load-balancing field. This document defines load-balancing
fields for tunnel types 1 (L2TPv3 over IP) and 2 (GRE) as follows:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
L2TPv3 over IP - Session ID. Special care needs to be taken to always
create a non-zero Session ID. When an egress router includes a 
Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV,
it MUST encode the Session ID field of the encapsulation
sub-TLV in a way that ensures that the most significant bits of the
Session ID, after extracting the block, are non-zero.
</t>
<t>
GRE - GRE Key
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
This document does not define a load-balancing field
for the IP-in-IP tunnel type (tunnel types 7).
Future tunnel types that desire to use the Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV MUST
define a load-balancing field that is part of the encapsulating header.
</t>
</section>
<section anchor="Encapsulation" title="Encapsulation Considerations">
<t>
Fields included in the encapsulation header besides the load-balancing
field are not affected by the Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV. All other
encapsulation fields are shared between variations of the load-balancing
field. For example, for the L2TPv3-over-IP tunnel type, if the optional
cookie is included in the encapsulation sub-TLV by the egress router during 
Softwire signaling, it applies to all the "Session ID" values derived at
the ingress router after applying the load-balancing block as described
in this document.
