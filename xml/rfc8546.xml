<t>This document defines the wire image, an abstraction of the information
available to an on-path non-participant in a networking protocol. This
abstraction is intended to shed light on the implications that increased
encryption has for network functions that use the wire image.

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>A protocol specification defines a set of behaviors for each participant in
the protocol: which lower-layer protocols are used for which services, how
messages are formatted and protected, which participant sends which message
when, how each participant should respond to each message, and so on.</t>

<t>Implicit in a protocol specification is the information the protocol radiates
toward nonparticipant observers of the messages sent among participants, often
including participants in lower-layer protocols. Any information that has a
clear definition in the protocol's message format(s), or is implied by that
definition, and is not cryptographically confidentiality protected can be
unambiguously interpreted by those observers. This information comprises the
protocol's wire image, which we define and discuss in this document.</t>

<t>The wire image, not the protocol's specification, determines how
third parties on the network paths among protocol participants will interact
with that protocol.</t>

<t>The increasing deployment of transport-layer security <xref target="RFC8446"/> to protect
application-layer headers and payload, as well as the definition and deployment
of transport protocols with encrypted control information such as QUIC <xref
target="QUIC"/>, brings new relevance to the question of how third parties on
the network paths will interact with a protocol. QUIC is,
in effect, the first IETF-defined transport protocol to take care of the
minimization of its own wire image to prevent ossification and improve
end-to-end privacy by reducing information radiation.</t>

<t>The flip side of this trend is the impact of a less visible wire image on various
functions driven by third-party observation of the wire image. In contrast to
ongoing discussions about this tussle, this document treats the wire image as a
pure abstraction, with the hope that it can shed some light on these
discussions.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="definition" title="Definition">

<t>The wire image of the set of protocols in use for a given communication is the
view of that set of protocols as observed by an entity not participating in the
communication. It is the sequence of packets sent by each participant in the
communication, including the content of those packets and metadata about the
observation itself: the time at which each packet is observed and the vantage
point of the observer.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="discussion" title="Discussion">

<t>This definition illustrates some important properties of the wire image.</t>

<t>It is key that the wire image is not limited to merely "the unencrypted bits in the
header". In particular, the metadata, such as sequences of interpacket timing
and packet sizes, can be used to infer other parameters of the behavior of
the protocols in use or to fingerprint protocols and/or specific
implementations of those protocols; see <xref target="time-and-size"/>.</t>

<t>An important implication of this property is that a protocol that uses
confidentiality protection for the headers it needs to operate can be
deliberately designed to have a specified wire image that is separate from
that machinery; see <xref target="engineering"/>. Note that this is a capability unique to
encrypted protocols. Parts of a wire image may also be made visible to devices
on path, but immutable through end-to-end integrity protection; see
<xref target="integrity"/>.</t>

<t>Portions of the wire image of a protocol stack that are neither
confidentiality protected nor integrity protected are writable by devices on the
path(s) between the endpoints using the protocols. A protocol with a wire image
that is largely writable operating over a path with devices that understand the
semantics of the protocol's wire image can modify it in order to induce
behaviors at the protocol's participants. TCP is one such protocol in the
current Internet.</t>

<t>The term "wire image" can be applied in different scopes: the wire image of a
single packet refers to the information derivable from observing that one packet
in isolation, and the wire image of a single protocol refers to the information
derivable from observing only the headers belonging to that protocol on a
sequence of packets in isolation from other protocols in use for a
communication. See <xref target="extent"/> for more.</t>

<t>For a given packet observed at a given point in the network, the wire image
contains information from the entire stack of protocols in use at that
observation point. This implies that the wire image depends on the observer as
well: each observer may see a slightly different image of the same
communication.</t>

<t>In this document, we assume that only information at the transport layer and
above is delivered end-to-end, and we focus on the "Internet" wire image: that
portion of the wire image at the network layer and above. While confidentiality
and integrity protection may be added at multiple layers in the stack,
protection below the network layer does not prevent modification either by the
devices terminating those security associations or by devices on different
segments of the path.
</t>

<section anchor="extent" title="The Extent of the Wire Image">

<t>While we begin this definition as the properties of a sequence of packets in
isolation, this is not how wire images are typically used by passive observers.
A passive observer will generally consider the union of all the information in
the wire image in all the packets generated by a given conversation.</t>

<t>Similarly, the wire image of a single protocol is rarely seen in isolation. The
dynamics of the application and network stacks on each endpoint use multiple
protocols for any higher-level task. Most protocols involving user content, for
example, are often seen on the wire together with DNS traffic; the information
from the wire image from each protocol in use for a given communication can be
correlated to infer information about the dynamics of the overlying application.</t>

<t>Information from protocol wire images is also not generally used on its
own but is rather additionally correlated with other context information
available to the observer, e.g., information about other communications engaged
in by each endpoint, information about the implementations of the protocols at
each endpoint, information about the network and internetwork topology near
those endpoints, and so on. This context can be used together with information
from the wire image to reach more detailed inferences about endpoint and
end-user behavior.</t>

<t>Note also that the wire image is multidimensional. This implies that the name
"image" is not merely metaphorical and that general image recognition
techniques may be applicable to extracting patterns and information from it.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="time-and-size" title="Obscuring Timing and Sizing Information">
 
<t>Cryptography can protect the confidentiality of a protocol's headers to the
extent that forwarding devices do not need the confidentiality-protected
information for basic forwarding operations. Ciphersuites and other transmission
techniques designed to prevent timing analysis can also be applied at the sender
to reduce the information content of the metadata portion of the wire image.
However, there are limits to these techniques. Packets cannot be made smaller
than their information content, be sent faster than processing time requirements at
the sender allow, or be transmitted through the network faster than the speed
of light. Since these techniques operate at the expense of
bandwidth efficiency and latency, they are also limited to the application's
tolerance for latency and bandwidth inefficiency.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="integrity" title="Integrity Protection of the Wire Image">

<t>Adding end-to-end integrity protection to portions of the wire image makes it
impossible for on-path devices to modify them without detection by the
endpoints, which can then take action in response to those modifications,
making these portions of the wire image effectively immutable. However, they
can still be observed by devices on path. This allows the creation of signals
intended by the endpoints solely for the consumption of these on-path devices.</t>

<t>Integrity protection can only practically be applied to the sequence of bits
in each packet, which implies that a protocol's visible wire image cannot be
made completely immutable in a packet-switched network. Interarrival timings,
for instance, cannot be easily protected, as the observable delay sequence is
modified as packets move through the network and experience different delays
on different links. 


Message sequences are also not practically protectable, because
packets may be dropped or reordered at any point in the network as a
consequence of the network's operation. Intermediate systems with knowledge of
the protocol semantics in the readable portion of the wire image can also
purposely delay or drop packets in order to affect the protocol's operation.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="engineering" title="Engineering the Wire Image">

<t>Understanding the nature of a protocol's wire image allows it to be
engineered. The general principle at work here, observed through experience
with deployability and non-deployability of protocols at the network and
transport layers in the Internet, is that all observable parts of a protocol's
wire image will eventually be used by devices on path. Consequently, changes
or future extensions that affect the observable part of the wire image become
difficult or impossible to deploy.</t>

<t>A network function that serves a purpose useful to its deployer will use the
information it needs from the wire image and will tend to get that
information from the wire image in the simplest way possible.</t>

<t>For example, consider the case of the ubiquitous TCP <xref target="RFC0793"/> transport
protocol. As described in <xref target="PATH-SIGNALS"/>, several
key in-network functions have evolved to take advantage of implicit signals in
TCP's wire image, which, as TCP provides neither integrity or confidentiality
protection for its headers, is inseparable from its internal operation. Some
of these include:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Determining return routability and consent: For example, TCP's wire image
contains both an implicit indication that the sender of a packet is at least
on the path toward its source address (in the acknowledgement number during
the handshake), as well as an implicit indication that a receiving device
consents to continue communication. These are used by stateful network
firewalls.</t>
  <t>Measuring loss and latency: For example, examining the sequence of TCP's
sequence and acknowledgement numbers, as well as the ECN <xref target="RFC3168"/>
control bits, allows the inference of congestion, loss, and retransmission
along the path. The sequence and acknowledgement numbers together with the
timestamp option <xref target="RFC7323"/> allow the measurement of
application-experienced latency.</t>
</list></t>

<t>During the design of a protocol, the utility of features like these should
be considered.  The protocol's wire image can be designed to explicitly expose
information to those network functions deemed important by the designers. The
wire image should expose as little other information as possible.</t>

<t>However, even when information is explicitly provided to the network, any
information that is exposed by the wire image, even information not
intended to be consumed by an observer, must be designed carefully, as deployed
network functions using that information may render it immutable for future
versions of the protocol. For example, information needed to support decryption
by the receiving endpoint (cryptographic handshakes, sequence numbers, and so
on) may be used by devices along the path for their own purposes.</t>

<section anchor="declaring-protocol-invariants" title="Declaring Protocol Invariants">

<t>One potential approach to reduce the extent of the wire image that will be used
by devices on the path is to define a set of invariants for a protocol during
its development. Declaring a protocol's invariants represents a promise made by
the protocol's developers that certain bits in the wire image, and behaviors
observable in the wire image, will be preserved through the specification of all
future versions of the protocol. QUIC's invariants
<xref target="QUIC-INVARIANTS"/> are an initial attempt to apply
this approach to QUIC.</t>

<t>While static aspects of the wire image (bits with simple semantics at fixed
positions in protocol headers) can easily be made invariant, different
aspects of the wire image may be more or less appropriate to define as
invariants. For a protocol with a version and/or extension negotiation
mechanism, the bits in the header and the behaviors tied to those bits, which
implement version negotiation, should be made invariant. More fluid aspects of
the wire image and behaviors that are not necessary for interoperability are
not appropriate as invariants.</t>

<t>Parts of a protocol's wire image not declared invariant but intended to be
visible to devices on path should be protected against "accidental
invariance": the deployment of on-path devices over time that make simplifying
assumptions about the behavior of those parts of the wire image, making new
behaviors not meeting those assumptions difficult to deploy. Integrity
protection of the wire image may itself help protect against accidental
invariance, because read-only wire images invite less meddling than
path-writable wire images. The techniques discussed in
<xref target="USE-IT"/> may also be useful in further
preventing accidental invariance and ossification.</t>

<t>Likewise, parts of a protocol's wire image not declared invariant and not
intended to be visible to the path should be encrypted to protect their
confidentiality. When confidentiality protection is either not possible or not
practical, then, as above, the approaches discussed in <xref target="USE-IT"/> may be
useful in ossification prevention.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="trustworthiness-of-engineered-signals" title="Trustworthiness of Engineered Signals">

<t>Since signals in the wire image that are engineered to be exposed are
separate from the signals that drive an encrypted protocol's mechanisms, the
accuracy of these signals intended for consumption by the path may not be
verifiable by on-path devices; see <xref target="PATH-SIGNALS"/>. Indeed, any
two endpoints with a secret channel
between them (in this case, the encrypted protocol itself) may collude to
change the semantics and information content of these signals. This is an
unavoidable consequence of the separation of the wire image from the
protocol's operation afforded by confidentiality protection of the protocol's
headers.</t>

<t>
This document explores the information exposed by the wire image that may be
relevant to end-to-end communication privacy and security. When designing the
wire image of a network protocol, care must be taken to expose only that
information to the network deemed necessary in the protocol's design, and
careful design is necessary to reduce the risk that information not explicitly
included in the wire image is derivable from its observation.
