<section anchor='intro' title='Introduction'>

	 <t>ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, <xref target="RFC3761" />) 
	 is a system that 
	 transforms <xref target="E164">E.164 numbers</xref> into domain names and 
	 then queries the <xref target="RFC1034">DNS (Domain Name Service) </xref> 
	 for <xref target="RFC3401">NAPTR (Naming Authority Pointer)
	 records</xref> in order to look up which services are
	 available for a specific domain name.
	 </t>

	 <t>ENUM, as defined in RFC 3761 (User ENUM), is not well suited for the
	 purpose of interconnection by carriers and voice-service providers, 
         as can be seen by the use of various private tree
	 arrangements based on ENUM mechanisms.</t>


	 <t>Infrastructure ENUM is defined as the use of the technology in
	 <xref target="RFC3761">RFC 3761</xref> 
	 by the <xref target="RFC5067">carrier-of-record (voice service
	 provider) 
	 </xref> for a specific <xref target="E164">E.164
	 number</xref> in order to
	 publish a mapping of this telephone number to 
	 one or more <xref target="RFC3986">Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)</xref>.
	</t>
<!--[rfced] Please note that "carrier-of-record" appears hyphenated in
RFC 5067. We have updated the term in this document to match that
hyphenation. Let us know if this is incorrect.-->

	<t>
	Other voice service providers can query the DNS for this mapping and use the
	resulting URIs as input into their call-routing algorithm. 
	 These URIs are separate from any URIs that the end-user who    
	 registers an E.164 number in ENUM may wish to associate with that     
	 E.164 number.                                                          
	 </t>

	 <t>The requirements, terms, and definitions for Infrastructure
	 ENUM are defined in 
	 <xref target="RFC5067"></xref>.
	 </t>

	 <t>Using the same E.164 number to domain mapping techniques for
	 other applications under a different, internationally agreed-upon
	 apex (instead of e164.arpa) is straightforward on the technical side.  
	 This process of defining the Dynamic Delegation Discovery&nbsp;System <xref target="RFC3401">(DDDS)</xref> application  for 
         Infrastructure ENUM is defined in
	 <xref target="RFC5526"></xref>. 


         This is the
	 long-term solution.</t>

	<t>
	This document presents an interim solution for Infrastructure ENUM 
	and a mechanism for transitioning to the long-term solution. The    
	interim solution is based on establishing a branch in the e164.arpa tree, 
	which resolvers may locate by following the algorithm      
	described in <xref target="alg"/>.
	The location of the branch is dependent upon country-code length, 
	and thus resolvers must determine the position of the branch based on the 
	method described in <xref target="pos"/>.
	Finally, <xref target="transition"/> provides a way that implementations following  
	the procedures of Sections <xref target="alg"
	format="counter"/> and 
	<xref target="pos" format="counter"/> may be seamlessly redirected to 
	the long-term solution, when it becomes available.

<section anchor="Terminology" title="Terminology">
	 <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
	 "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
	 document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14,
	 <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor='Interim' title='Interim Solution'>

	 <t>The agreements to establish the long-term solution may take
	 some time. It was therefore decided to develop an interim solution that
	 can be used by individual countries to implement an interoperable Infrastructure
	 ENUM tree immediately. The interim solution will be deprecated 
	 when the long-term solution <xref target="RFC5526"/> is
	 deployed.  

<!--[rfced] Because the long-term solution will be published, we 
changed "becomes available" to be "is deployed". Please let us 
know if this should be reverted/changed.-->

	 It is therefore also required that the  
         interim solution includes a smooth migration path to the long-term solution.
	 </t>

         <t>It is also required that existing ENUM clients querying User ENUM as
         defined in <xref target="RFC3761">RFC 3761</xref> continue to work without any
         modification.</t>

         <t>Because of various reasons (e.g., potentially different delegation points, 
	 different reliability requirements, and use of DNS wildcards), sharing a single 
	 domain name between the user itself and the respective
	 carrier for a given number is not possible. 
         Hence, a different domain name must be used to store infrastructure ENUM 
         information.</t>
 
         <t>
         In order to avoid the delays associated with the long-term solution, the 
         existing delegations and agreements around e164.arpa need to be
         leveraged.</t>


         <t>The method most easily fulfilling the requirements
	  is to branch off the e164.arpa tree into a subdomain at the
	  country-code delegation level below e164.arpa and deploy an Infrastructure
	  ENUM subtree underneath, without touching User ENUM semantics at all.
	 </t>

	 <t>This allows countries using a dedicated country code to
	 introduce the interim solution
	 as a national matter to the concerned National Regulation Authority (NRA).
	 The governing body of a shared country code and the owner of a global
	 network code can also choose to implement this solution within their
	 area of responsibility.
	 </t>

	 <t>Under this approach, ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union / 
	 Telecommunication Standardization Sector), IETF, and IAB
	 involvement is only lightweight, e.g., to recommend the
	 proper algorithm defined here to enable international
	 interoperability.
	 </t>

</section>

<section anchor='alg' title='The Algorithm'>

       <t>
        RFC 3761 defines ENUM as a Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS)
        application according to <xref target="RFC3401">RFC 3401</xref>.

<!-- [rfced] Should this read "application in accordance with RFC
3401"? -->

        As such, ENUM defines the following components of the DDDS algorithm:
        </t>

        <list style="numbers">
                <t>Application Unique String</t>
                <t>First Well-Known Rule</t>
                <t>Expected Output</t>
                <t>Valid Databases</t>
        </list>

        <t>
	The "Valid Databases" part contains the transformation of an E.164
	telephone number into a domain name.
        Section 2.4 of RFC 3761 uses the following 4-step algorithm for this:
	</t>


        <list style="numbers">
                <t>Remove all characters with the exception of the digits.</t>
                <t>Put dots (".") between each digit.</t>
                <t>Reverse the order of the digits.</t>
                <t>Append the string ".e164.arpa" to the end.</t>
        </list>

	<t>
	The interim solution for Infrastructure ENUM uses a modified version
	of this algorithm:
	</t>

        <list style="numbers">
                <t>
		Determine the proper POSITION parameter for this E.164 number
		according to the algorithm in <xref target="pos"/> of
		this document.
                </t>


                <t>Build an ordered list of single-digit strings from all digits appearing 
		in the telephone number.
                   All non-digit characters are ignored.
                </t>


                <t>Insert a string consisting of "i" into this list,
                after POSITION strings. If the list of strings was
                shorter than POSITION elements, then report an error.
                </t>

                <t>Reverse the order of the list.</t>

                <t>Append the string "e164.arpa" to the end of the list.</t>

                <t>Create a single domain name by joining the list together with dots
                (".") between each string.</t>
        </list>

	<t>
	This is the only point where the interim Infrastructure ENUM (I-ENUM)
	solution differs from straight RFC 3761 ENUM. 
	All other parts of User ENUM, including the 
	enumservices registrations, apply to I-ENUM as well.
	</t>

</section>

<section anchor='pos' title='Determining the Position of the Branch'>

	<t>
	In order to allow for the deployment of this interim solution
	independent of IAB/ITU-T/RIPE-NCC negotiations, the branching label
	"i" cannot be inserted in the Tier-0 zone 
	(i.e., the e164.arpa zone itself) 
	currently managed by RIPE NCC.
	This condition acts as a lower bound on the choice of the
	POSITION parameter.
	</t>

	<t>
	For international E.164-numbers for geographic areas 
	(Section 6.2.1 of <xref target="E164"/>) and for 
	international E.164-numbers for global services 
	(Section 6.2.2 of <xref target="E164"/>),
	the most sensible choice for POSITION is the number of digits
	in the country code of the number in question. This
	places the branch directly under the country-code level
	within the e164.arpa ENUM tree. 
	</t>

	<t>
	For international E.164-number for networks
	(Section 6.2.3 of <xref target="E164"/>), the appropriate choice
	for POSITION is the combined length of the CC (Country Code)
	and IC (Identification Code) fields.
	</t>

	<t>
	For international E.164-number for groups of countries
	(Section 6.2.4 of <xref target="E164"/>), the value 
	for POSITION is 4. 
	</t>

     <t>
     The authoritative source for up-to-date country code and network
     Identification Code allocations is published by the ITU-T as a complement 
     to the recommendation E.164
     <xref target="E164"/>. The current version of this complement is available from the
     ITU website under "ITU-T / Service Publications".
     </t> 

	<t>
	Please note that country code 1 of the
	North American Numbering Plan (NANP) does not fall under
	the ITU classification of "groups of countries", but is
	a "shared country code" for a geographic area. Thus, the POSITION parameter
	for the NANP is 1.
	</t>

     <t>
     As of 2007, the POSITION value for a specific E.164 number can be determined with the
     following algorithm:
     </t>

<list style='symbols'> 	
<t>If the number starts with 1 or 7, then POSITION is 1.</t>
<t>If the number is in one of the following 2-digit country codes,
  then POSITION is 2: 20, 27,
30-34, 36, 39, 40, 41, 43-49, 51-58, 60-66,
81, 82, 84, 86, 90-95, or 98.</t>
<t>If the number starts with 388 or 881, then POSITION is 4.</t>
<t>If the number starts with 878 or 882, then POSITION is 5.</t>
<t>If the number starts with 883 and the next digit is < 5, then POSITION is 6.</t>
<t>If the number starts with 883 and the next digit is >= 5, then POSITION is 7.</t>
<t>In all other cases, POSITION is 3.</t>
</list> 

	<t>Given the fact that the ITU-T recently allocated only 3-digit
	country codes, there are no more spare 1- and 2-digit country
	codes and existing 1- and 2-digit country codes are extremely
	unlikely to be recovered, the above list of 
	existing 1- and 2-digit country codes can be considered very
	stable. The only problem may be for a country that has split, as happened
	recently, for example, to Yugoslavia. 
	</t>
	<t>
	 Regarding network codes, up to 2007, the ITU-T has only allocated 1-
	 and 2-digit ICs. Assignments of 3- and 4-digit ICs started in
	 May 2007 in the +883 country code. Any further change in the ITU-T policy in
	 this respect will need to be reflected in the above
	 algorithm.
	</t>

</section>


<section anchor='transition' title='Transition to the Long-Term Solution'>

	<t>
	The proposed long-term solution for Infrastructure ENUM 
	<xref target="RFC5526"/> is the
	establishment of a new zone apex for that tree. This apex
	will play the same role as "e164.arpa" does for User ENUM.
	</t>

	<t>
	It is unrealistic to assume that all countries and all 
	ENUM clients will manage to migrate from the 
	interim solution to the long-term solution at a single point in time.
	It is thus necessary to plan for an incremental transition.
	</t>

	<t>
	In order to achieve this, clients using the interim solution
	need to be redirected to the long-term I-ENUM tree for
	all country codes that have already switched to the long-term
	solution. This SHOULD be done by placing 
	<xref target="RFC2672">DNAME</xref>
	records at the
	branch (the "i") label pointing to the appropriate domain name
	in the long-term I-ENUM tree.  All descendants at that branch 
	label location where the DNAME
	record is inserted MUST be removed, as required by Section 3 of 
	RFC 2672.
	</t>

	<t>
	Therefore, ALL entities involved in making or answering DNS queries for
	I-ENUM MUST fully support the DNAME record type and its semantics. In
	particular, entities involved in I-ENUM lookups MUST correctly handle
	responses containing synthesized CNAMEs that may be generated as a
	consequence of DNAME processing by any other element in resolution,
	typically an iterative mode resolving name server.  These entities
	MUST also apply adequate measures to detect loops and prevent
	non-terminating resolutions because of improperly configured DNAME
	records or combinations of DNAME and CNAME records.
	</t>

	<t>
   Note: Some caching name server implementations are known to          
   handle DNAMEs incorrectly. In the worst case, such bugs could        
   stay undetected until a country transitions to the long-term      
   solution. Therefore, ensuring full DNAME support from the start (and 
   carefully testing that it actually works) is important.              
	</t>

	<t>
	The domain name for the branch location and its DNAME record SHOULD be
	removed once the transition to the long-term solution is completed and
	all entities involved in I-ENUM have migrated to the new zone apex for
	I-ENUM.
	</t>
</section>

        <section anchor='examples' title='Examples'>


	<t>
	These are two examples of how E.164 numbers translate to 
	Infrastructure ENUM domains according to the interim solution.

	  <artwork>
+1 21255501234          4.3.2.1.0.5.5.5.2.1.2.i.1.e164.arpa
+44 2079460123          3.2.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.i.4.4.e164.arpa
	  </artwork>
	  </t>
	  <t>Here is the list of the intermediate steps for the second example to visualize how the 
	  algorithm defined in <xref target="alg"/> operates on "+44 2079460123":
	  </t>

	<list style="numbers">
		<t>
		"+44 2079460123" is within a 2-digit country code; thus,
		POSITION is 2.
		</t>


		<t>The list of strings is ("4","4","2","0","7","9","4","6","0","1","2","3")
		</t>


		<t>POSITION is 2; thus, "i" is
		   inserted between the second and the third string, yielding:
		   ("4","4","i","2","0","7","9","4","6","0","1","2","3")
		</t>
		   
		<t>Reversing the list gives:
		   ("3","2","1","0","6","4","9","7","0","2","i","4","4")
		</t>

		<t>Appending "e164.arpa" yields:
		   ("3","2","1","0","6","4","9","7","0","2","i","4","4","e164.arpa")
		</t>

		<t>Concatenation with dots yields: "3.2.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.i.4.4.e164.arpa"
		</t>
	</list>

	  <t>
	  After the introduction of the long-term Infrastructure ENUM solution,
	  using, for example, "ienum.example.net" as the new apex for I-ENUM, the 
	  administrators of +44 can implement a smooth transition 
	  by putting the following DNAME record in their zone:
	  <artwork>
i.4.4.e164.arpa.    IN DNAME 4.4.ienum.example.net.
	  </artwork>

	  This way, clients using the interim I-ENUM solution end up querying
	  the same tree as clients implementing the long-term solution.
	  </t>

</section>


<section anchor='security' title='Security Considerations'>

	<t>Privacy issues have been raised regarding the unwarranted 
disclosure of user information that would result from publishing 
Infrastructure ENUM information in the public DNS. For instance, 
such disclosure could be used for harvesting numbers in service or 
obtaining unlisted numbers.</t>

	<t>Given that number-range allocation is public information,
	we believe the easiest way to cope with such concerns is to
	fully unroll allocated number ranges in the Infrastructure ENUM
	subtree, wherever such privacy concerns exist. Whether or not a
	number is served would be exposed by the carrier-of-record when an attempt is made to contact the corresponding
	URI. We assume this to be an authenticated operation, which
	would not leak information to unauthorized parties.
	</t>

	<t>Entering all numbers in an allocated number range, whether
	serviced or not, or whether listed or unlisted, will prevent mining
	attempts for such number attributes.
	</t>

	<t>The result will be that the information in the public DNS
	will mirror number-range allocation information, but no
	more. Infrastructure ENUM will not tell you more than you can get by
	just dialing numbers.
	</t>

	<t>The URI pointing to the destination network of the carrier-of-record should also not disclose any privacy information
	about the identity of the end-user. It is therefore recommended to
	use either anonymized UserIDs
	or the E.164 number itself in the user part of the URI, such as in
	sip:+441632960084@example.com.
