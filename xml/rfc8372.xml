<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>
This document discusses the aspects that need to be considered
when developing a solution for MPLS flow identification. 
The key
application that needs this is in-band performance monitoring
of MPLS flows when MPLS is used to encapsulate user data packets.</t>

<t>There is a need to identify flows in MPLS networks for various applications
such as determining packet loss and packet delay measurement.  A
method of loss
and delay measurement in MPLS networks was defined in <xref target="RFC6374"/>.
When used to measure packet loss, <xref target="RFC6374"/> depends on the use of
injected Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) packets to
designate the beginning and the end of the packet group over which
packet loss is being measured.  
If the misordering of packets from one group relative to the following group
or the misordering of any of the packets being counted relative to the Loss
Measurement packet <xref target="RFC6374"/> occurs, then an error will occur
in the packet loss measurement.</t>

<t>In
addition, <xref target="RFC6374"/> did not support  different granularities of flow
or address
a number of multipoint cases in which two or more ingress Label
Switching Routers (LSRs) could send packets to one or more
destinations.</t>

<t>Due to the very low loss rate in normal operation, improvements in link and transmission technologies have made it more
difficult to assess packet loss using active performance
measurement methods with synthetic traffic.  That, together with more
demanding service-level requirements, means that network operators now need to
be able to
measure the loss of the actual user data traffic using passive
performance measurement methods.  Any technique deployed needs to be
transparent to the end user, and it needs to be assumed that they
will not take any active part in the measurement process.
Indeed, it is important that any flow identification technique be invisible 
to them and that no remnant of the measurement process leaks into their 
network.</t>

<t>Additionally, when there are multiple traffic sources, such as in
multipoint-to-point and multipoint-to-multipoint network
environments, there needs to be a method whereby the sink can
distinguish between packets from the various sources; that is to say, a
multipoint measurement model needs to be developed.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="loss-measurement-considerations" title="Loss Measurement Considerations">

<t>Modern networks, if not oversubscribed, generally drop relatively few
packets; thus, packet loss measurement is highly sensitive to the 
common demarcation of the exact set of packets to be measured for loss.
Without some form of coloring or batch marking such as that
proposed in <xref target="RFC8321"/>, it may not be possible to achieve
the required accuracy in the loss measurement of customer data
traffic.  Thus, when accurate measurement of packet loss is required, it may be
economically advantageous, or even be a technical requirement, to include some
form of marking in the packets to assign each packet to a particular counter
for loss measurement purposes.
</t>

<t>
When this level of accuracy is required and the traffic between a
source-destination pair is subject to Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP), a
demarcation mechanism is needed to group the packets into batches.
Once a batch is correlated at both ingress and egress, the packet
accounting mechanism is then able to operate on the batch of packets
that can be accounted for at both the packet ingress and the packet
egress.  Errors in the accounting are particularly acute in Label
Switched Paths (LSPs) subjected to ECMP because the network transit
time will be different for the various ECMP paths since:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>the packets may traverse different sets of LSRs;</t>
  <t>the packets may depart from different interfaces on different
line cards on LSRs; and</t>
  <t>the packets may arrive at different interfaces on different line
cards on LSRs.</t>
</list></t>

<t>A consideration with this solution on modifying the identity label
(the MPLS label
ordinarily used to identify the LSP, Virtual Private Network,
Pseudowire, etc.) to indicate the batch is the impact that this has on
the path chosen by the ECMP mechanism.  When the member of the ECMP
path set is chosen by deep packet inspection, a change of batch 
represented by a change of identity label will have no impact on the
ECMP path.  
If the path member is chosen by reference to an entropy label
<xref target="RFC6790"/>, then changing the batch identifier will not result
in a change to the chosen ECMP path.
ECMP is so pervasive in
multipoint-to-(multi)point networks that some method of avoiding
accounting errors introduced by ECMP needs to be supported.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="delay-measurement-considerations" title="Delay Measurement Considerations">

<t>Most of the existing delay measurement methods are active methods
that depend on the extra injected test packet to evaluate the delay
of a path.  With the active measurement method, the rate, numbers, and
interval between the injected packets may affect the accuracy of the
results. Due to ECMP (or link aggregation techniques), injected test packets may 
traverse different links from the ones used by the data traffic.
Thus, measuring the delay of the real traffic is required.
</t>

<t>For combined loss and delay measurements, both the loss and the delay
considerations apply.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="units" title="Units of Identification">

<t>The most basic unit of identification is the identity of the node
that processed the packet on its entry to the MPLS network.  However,
the required unit of identification may vary depending on the use
case for accounting, performance measurement, or other types of packet
observations.  In particular, note that there may be a need to impose
identity at several different layers of the MPLS label stack.</t>

<t>This document considers the identification of the following traffic components:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Per source LSR: everything from one source is aggregated</t>
  <t>Per group of LSPs chosen by an ingress LSR: an ingress LSP aggregates a
  group of LSPs (e.g., all the LSPs of a tunnel)</t>
  <t>Per LSP: the basic form</t>
  <t>Per flow <xref target="RFC6790"/> within an LSP: a fine-grained method</t>
</list></t>

<t>Note that a fine-grained identity resolution is needed when there is
a need to perform these operations on a flow not readily identified
by some other element in the label stack.
Such a fine-grained
resolution may be possible by deep packet inspection. However, this may
not always be possible, or it may be desired to minimize processing
costs by doing this only on entry to the network. 
Adding a
suitable identifier to the packet for reference by other network
elements minimizes the processing needed by other network
elements.
An example of such a fine-grained case might be traffic
belonging to a certain service or from a
specific source, particularly if matters related to service level
agreement or application performance were being investigated.</t>

<t>We can thus characterize the identification requirement in the
following broad terms:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>There needs to be some way for an egress LSR to identify the
ingress LSR with an appropriate degree of scope.  This concept is
discussed further in <xref target="scope"/>.</t>
  <t>There needs to be a way to identify a specific LSP at the egress
node.  This allows for the case of instrumenting multiple LSPs
operating between the same pair of nodes.  In such cases, the
identity of the ingress LSR is insufficient.</t>
  <t>In order to conserve resources such as labels, counters, and/or
compute cycles, it may be desirable to identify an LSP group so
that an operation can be performed on the group as an aggregate.</t>
  <t>There needs to be a way to identify a flow within an LSP.  This is
necessary when investigating a specific flow that has been
aggregated into an LSP.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The unit of identification and the method of determining which
packets constitute a flow will be specific to the application or use case
and are out of scope of this document.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="types-of-lsp" title="Types of LSP">

<t>We need to consider a number of types of LSP.  The two simplest types
to monitor are point-to-point LSPs and point-to-multipoint LSPs.
The ingress LSR for a point-to-point LSP, such as those created using
the Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)
<xref target="RFC5420"/> signaling protocol or those that conform to the MPLS
Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) <xref target="RFC5654"/>, may be identified by inspection
of the top label in the stack because, at any provider-edge (PE) or
provider (P) router on the path, the top label is unique to the ingress-egress
pair at every hop at a given layer in the LSP hierarchy. 

Provided
that Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP) is disabled, the identity of the ingress
LSR of a point-to-point LSP is available at the egress LSR; thus,
determining the identity of the ingress LSR must be regarded as a
solved problem.  Note, however, that the identity of a flow cannot to
be determined without further information being carried in the
packet or gleaned from some aspect of the packet payload.</t>

<t>In the case of a point-to-multipoint LSP, and in the absence of
PHP, the identity of the ingress LSR may
also be inferred from the top label.  However, it may not possible to
adequately identify the flow from the top label alone; thus,
further information may need to be carried in the packet or gleaned
from some aspect of the packet payload.  

In designing any solution, it is desirable that a common flow identification
solution be used for both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint LSP types.

Similarly, it is
desirable that a common method of LSP group identification be used.
In the above cases, a context label <xref target="RFC5331"/> needs to be used to
provide the required identity information.  This is a widely supported
MPLS feature.</t>

<t>A more interesting case is the case of a multipoint-to-point LSP.
In this case, the same label is normally used by multiple ingress or
upstream LSRs; hence, source identification is not possible by
inspection of the top label by the egress LSRs.  It is therefore
necessary for a packet to be able to explicitly convey any of the
identity types described in <xref target="units"/>.</t>

<t>Similarly, in the case of a multipoint-to-multipoint LSP, the same
label is normally used by multiple ingress or upstream LSRs; hence,
source identification is not possible by inspection of the top label
by egress LSRs.  The various identity types described in <xref target="units"/>
are again needed.  Note, however, that the scope of the identity may
be constrained to be unique within the set of multipoint-to-multipoint 
LSPs terminating on any common node.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="scope" title="Network Scope">

<t>The scope of identification can be constrained to the set of flows
that are uniquely identifiable at an ingress LSR or some aggregation
thereof.  There is no need for an ingress LSR to seek assistance from 
outside the MPLS protocol domain.</t>

<t>In any solution that constrains itself to carrying the required
identity in the MPLS label stack rather than in some different
associated data structure, constraints on the choice of
label and label stack size imply
that the scope of identity resides within that MPLS domain.  For
similar reasons, the identity scope of a component of an LSP is
constrained to the scope of that LSP.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="backwards-compatibility" title="Backwards Compatibility">

<t>In any network, it is unlikely that all LSRs will have the same
capability to support the methods of identification discussed in this
document.  It is therefore an important constraint on any flow identity
solution that it is backwards compatible with deployed MPLS equipment
to the extent that deploying the new feature will not disable
anything that currently works on the legacy equipment.</t>

<t>This is particularly the case when the deployment is incremental or
the feature is not required for all LSRs or all LSPs.  Thus,
the flow identification design must support the coexistence of
LSRs that can identify the traffic components
described in <xref target="units"/> and those that cannot.  In addition, the identification of the
traffic components described in <xref target="units"/> must be an optional feature
that is disabled by default.  As a design simplification, a solution
may require that all egress LSRs of a point-to-multipoint or a multipoint-to-multipoint LSP support the identification type in use so
that a single packet can be correctly processed by all egress
devices.  The corollary of this last point is that either all egress
LSRs are enabled to support the required identity type or none of
them are.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="dataplane" title="Data Plane">

<t>There is a huge installed base of MPLS equipment; typically, this type
of equipment remains in service for an extended period of time, and
in many cases, hardware constraints mean that it is not possible to
upgrade its data-plane functionality.  Changes to the MPLS data plane
are therefore expensive to implement, add complexity to the network,
and may significantly impact the deployability of a solution that
requires such changes.  For these reasons, MPLS users have
set a very high bar to changes to the MPLS data plane, and only a
very small number have been adopted.  Hence, it is important that the
method of identification must minimize changes to the MPLS data
plane.  Ideally, method(s) of identification that require no changes
to the MPLS data plane should be given preferential consideration.

If a method of identification that makes a change to the data plane is
chosen, it will need to have a significant advantage over any method
that makes no change, and the advantage of the approach will need to
be carefully evaluated and documented.  If a change to the MPLS data plane 
proves necessary, it should be (a) as small a
change as possible and (b) a general-purpose method, so as to
maximize its use for future applications.  It is imperative that, as
far as can be foreseen, any necessary change made to the MPLS data
plane does not impose any foreseeable future limitation on the MPLS
data plane.</t>

<t>Stack size is an issue with many MPLS implementations both as a
result of hardware limitations and due to the impact on networks and
applications in which a large number of small payloads need to be
transported. In particular, one MPLS payload may be carried inside
another.  For example, one LSP may be carried over another LSP, or a
Pseudowire (PW) or similar multiplexing construct may be carried over an LSP, and
identification may be required at both layers.  Of particular concern
is the implementation of low-cost edge LSRs that, for cost reasons,
have a significant limit on the number of Label Stack Entries (LSEs)
that they can impose or dispose.  Therefore, any method of identity
must not consume an excessive number of unique labels and must not
result in an excessive increase in the size of the label stack.</t>


<t>The design of the MPLS data plane provides two types of special-purpose
labels: the original 16 reserved labels and the much larger set of
special-purpose labels defined in <xref target="RFC7274"/>.  The original reserved
labels need one LSE, and the newer special-purpose
labels <xref target="RFC7274"/>
need two LSEs.  Given the tiny number of original reserved labels, it
is core to the MPLS design philosophy that this scarce resource is
only used when it is absolutely necessary.  
Using a special-purpose label to encode flow identity requires two label stack
entries, one for the reserved label and one for the flow identity.  Use of
extended special-purpose labels <xref target="RFC7274"/> requires a total of
three label stack entries to encode the flow identity. The larger set of 
<xref target="RFC7274"/> labels requires two
label stack entries for the special-purpose label itself; hence, a
total of three label stack entries is needed to encode the flow identity.</t>

<t>The use of special-purpose labels <xref target="RFC7274"/> as part of a method
to encode the identity information therefore has a number of
undesirable implications for the data plane. Thus, while a
solution may use special-purpose labels, methods that do not require
special-purpose labels need to be
carefully considered.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="control-plane" title="Control Plane">

<t>Any flow identity design should both seek to minimize the complexity
of the control plane and minimize the amount of label coordination needed amongst LSRs.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="privacy-considerations" title="Privacy Considerations">

<t>The inclusion of originating and/or flow information in a packet
provides more identity information and hence potentially degrades the
privacy of the communication.</t>  

<t>Recent IETF concerns on pervasive monitoring <xref target="RFC7258"/> have resulted in a
preference for a solution that does not degrade the privacy of user traffic
below that of an MPLS network not implementing the flow identification feature.
The choice of using
MPLS technology for this OAM solution has a privacy advantage, as
the choice of the label identifying a flow is limited to the
scope of the MPLS domain and does not have any dependency
on the identification of the user data. This minimizes the
observability of the flow characteristics.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<t>Any flow identification solution must not degrade the
   security of the MPLS network below that of an equivalent network not
   deploying the specified identity solution.
In order to
preserve present assumptions about MPLS privacy properties,
propagation of
identification information outside the MPLS network imposing it must
be disabled by default.  Any solution should provide for the
restriction of the identity information to those components of the
network that need to know it.  It is thus desirable to limit the
knowledge of the identify of an endpoint to only those LSRs that need
to participate in traffic flow. The choice of using MPLS technology
for this OAM solution, with MPLS encapsulation of user traffic,
provides for a key advantage over other data-plane solutions,
as it provides for a controlled access and trusted domain
within a service provider's network.</t>

mitigation techniques, please see "Security Framework for
MPLS and GMPLS Networks" <xref target="RFC5920"/>.</t>
