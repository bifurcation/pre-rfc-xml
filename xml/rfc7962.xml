    <abstract>
	    <t>This document presents a taxonomy of a set of "Alternative Network
      Deployments" that emerged in the last decade with the aim of bringing 
      Internet connectivity to people or providing a local communication 
      infrastructure to serve various complementary needs and objectives.
      They employ architectures and 
      topologies different from those of mainstream networks and rely 
      on alternative governance and business models.</t>

      <t>The document also surveys the technologies deployed in these networks, 
      and their differing architectural characteristics, including
      a set of definitions and shared properties.</t>
   
    	<t>The classification considers models such as Community Networks, 
      Wireless Internet Service Providers
      (WISPs), networks owned by individuals but leased out to network
      operators who use them as a low-cost medium to reach the
      underserved population, networks that provide
      connectivity by sharing wireless resources of the users, and rural
      utility cooperatives.</t>

	  <section title="Introduction">   	
		  <t>One of the aims of the Global Access to the Internet for All (GAIA) IRTF Research Group is
		  "to document and share deployment experiences and research results to the wider community 
		  through scholarly publications, white papers, Informational and Experimental RFCs, etc."
      <xref target="GAIA"/>. In line with this objective, this document proposes a classification of 
		  "Alternative Network Deployments". This term includes a set of network access models that have emerged 
		  in the last decade with the aim of providing Internet connections, following 
		  topological, architectural, governance, and business models that differ from the so-called "mainstream" ones,
      where a company deploys the infrastructure connecting the users, who pay a subscription fee to 
      be connected and make use of it.</t>
        
      <t>Several initiatives throughout the world have built these large-scale
      networks, using predominantly wireless technologies (including long
      distance links) due to the reduced cost of using unlicensed spectrum.
      Wired technologies such as fiber are also used in some of these
      networks.</t>
        
      <t>The classification considers several types of alternate
      deployments: Community Networks are self-organized networks 
      wholly owned by the community; networks 
      acting as Wireless Internet Service Providers
      (WISPs); networks owned by individuals but leased out to network
      operators who use such networks as a low-cost medium to reach the
      underserved population; networks that provide
      connectivity by sharing wireless resources of the users; and 
      finally there are some rural utility cooperatives also connecting
      their members to the Internet.</t>
     	
      <t>The emergence of these networks has been motivated by a variety of factors such as
      the lack of wired and cellular infrastructures in rural/remote areas <xref target="Pietrosemoli"/>. 
      In some cases, Alternative Networks may provide more localized communication 
      services as well as Internet backhaul support through peering agreements with 
      mainstream network operators. In other cases, they are 
      built as a complement or an alternative to commercial Internet access provided by
      mainstream network operators.</t>

      <t>The present document is intended to provide 
		  a broad overview of initiatives, technologies, and approaches employed in these networks,
      including some real examples. References describing each kind of network are also provided.</t>

		  <section title="Mainstream Networks">
    	  <t>In this document, we will use the term "mainstream networks" to denote those networks
    	  sharing these characteristics:</t>
    
        <t><list style="symbols">
    		  <t>Regarding scale, they are usually large networks spanning entire regions.</t>
    		
    		  <t>Top-down control of the network and centralized approach.</t>
    		
    		  <t>They require a substantial investment in infrastructure.</t>
            
          <t>Users in mainstream networks do not participate
          in the network design, deployment, operation, governance, and maintenance.</t>
        
          <t>Ownership of the network is never vested in the users themselves.</t>
        </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Alternative Networks">
        <t>The term "Alternative Network" proposed in this document refers to the
        networks that do not share the characteristics of "mainstream network deployments".
        Therefore, they may share some of the following characteristics:</t>
          
        <t><list style="symbols">
    		  <t>Relatively small scale (i.e., not spanning entire regions).</t>
    		
    		  <t>Administration may not follow a centralized approach.</t>
    		
    		  <t>They may require a reduced investment in infrastructure,
          which may be shared by the users and commercial and non-commercial
          entities.</t>
            
          <t>Users in Alternative Networks may participate
          in the network design, deployment, operation, and maintenance.</t>
        
          <t>Ownership of the network is often vested in the users.</t>
        </list></t>

    <section title="Terms Used in This Document" anchor="Glossary">

      
      <t>Considering the role that the Internet currently plays in everyday life,
      this document touches on complex social,
      political, and economic issues. Some of the concepts and terminology
      used have been the subject of study of various disciplines outside the
      field of networking and are responsible for long debates whose resolution
      is out of the scope of this document.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>"Global north" and "global south". Although there is no consensus on 
        the terms to be used when talking about the different development level of countries,
        we will employ the term "global south" to refer to nations with a relatively lower 
        standard of living. This distinction is normally intended 
        to reflect basic economic country conditions. In common practice, 
        Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in northern America, 
        Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and Europe are considered 
        "developed" regions or areas <xref target="UN"/>, so we will employ the term
        "global north" when talking about them.</t>
                    
        <t>The "Digital Divide". The following dimensions are considered to be meaningful 
        when measuring the digital development state of a country: infrastructures (availability and
        affordability), the Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
        sector (human capital and technological industry), digital literacy,
        legal and regulatory framework, and content and services. A lack of
        digital development in one or more of these dimensions is what has
        been referred as the "Digital Divide" <xref target="Norris"/>.
        It should be noted that this "Divide" is not only present between
        different countries but between zones of the same country, despite
        its degree of development.</t>

        <t>"Urban" and "rural" zones. There is no single definition of "rural" or "urban", 
        as each country and various international organizations define these terms differently, 
        mainly based on the number of inhabitants, the population density, and the distance between houses 
        <xref target="UNStats"/>. For networking purposes, the primary distinction is likely 
        the average distance between customers, typically measured by population density, 
        as well as the distance to the nearest Internet point-of-presence, i.e., the distance 
        to be covered by "middle mile" or backhaul connectivity.  Some regions with low average 
        population density may cluster almost all inhabitants into a small number of 
        relatively dense small towns, for example, while residents may be dispersed more 
        evenly in others.</t>
        
        <t>Demand. In economics, it describes a consumer's desire and willingness to 
        pay a price for a specific good or service.</t>
            
        <t>Provision is the act of making an asset available for sale. In this document,
        we will mainly use it as the act of making a network service available to the
        inhabitants of a zone.</t>
    
        <t>Underserved area. Area in which the telecommunication market permanently fails to provide the 
        information and communications services demanded by the population.</t>

      <t>Free, open, and neutral networks. Their principles have been summarized 
       this way <xref target="Baig"/>:
        
      <list style="symbols">
    	  <t>You have the freedom to use the network for any purpose as long as you do not harm the 
    	  operation of the network itself, the rights of other users, or the principles of neutrality 
    	  that allow contents and services to flow without deliberate interference.</t>
    			
    	  <t>You have the right to understand the network, to know its components, and to spread 
    	  knowledge of its mechanisms and principles.</t>
    
    	  <t>You have the right to offer services and content to the network on your own terms.</t>
    
    	  <t>You have the right to join the network, and the responsibility to extend this set of 
    	  rights to anyone according to these same terms.</t>
      </list></t></list></t>
    </section>  
     
	  <section title="Scenarios Where Alternative Networks Are Deployed"> 

      <t>Different studies have reported that as much as 60% of 
      the people on the planet do not have Internet connectivity
      <xref target="Sprague"/> <xref target="InternetStats"/>.
      In addition, those unconnected are unevenly distributed: only 31% of 
      the population in "global south" countries had access in 2014, against 
      80% in "global north" countries <xref target="WorldBank2016"/>. This is one 
      of the reasons behind the inclusion of the objective to "significantly increase 
      access to information and communications technology and strive to provide universal 
      and affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries by 2020," as one of the targets in the Sustainable 
      Development Goals (SDGs) <xref target="SDG"/>, considered as a part of "Goal 9. 
      Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable 
      industrialization and foster innovation."</t>   
            
      <t>For the purpose of this document, a distinction between "global north" and "global south"
      zones is made, highlighting the factors related to ICT, which can be quantified in terms of:</t>
        
      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>The availability of both national and international bandwidth, as well as equipment.</t>
        <t>The difficulty in paying for the services and the devices required to access the ICTs.</t>
        <t>The instability and/or lack of power supply.</t>
        <t>The scarcity of qualified staff.</t>
        <t>The existence of a policy and regulatory framework that hinders the development of these
        models in favor of state monopolies or incumbents.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>In this context, the
      World Summit of the Information Society <xref target="WSIS"/> aimed at achieving "a
      people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information
      Society, where everyone can create, access, utilize and share
      information and knowledge. Therefore, enabling individuals, communities and
      people to achieve their full potential in promoting their
      sustainable development and improving their quality of life".
      It also called upon "governments, private sector, civil society and
      international organizations" to actively engage to work towards the bridging of 
      the digital divide.</t>
        
		  <t>Some Alternative Networks have been deployed in underserved areas, where 
      citizens may be compelled to take a 
      more active part in the design and implementation of 
      ICT solutions. However, Alternative
      Networks (e.g., <xref target="Baig"/>) are also present in some "global 
      north" countries, being built as an 
      alternative to commercial ones managed by mainstream network operators.</t>
    
      <t>The consolidation of a number of mature Alternative Networks (e.g.,
      Community Networks) sets a precedent for civil society members 
      to become more active in the search for
      alternatives to provide themselves with affordable access.
      Furthermore, Alternative Networks could contribute to bridge the 
      digital divide by increasing human capital and promoting the creation 
      of localized content and services.</t>
      
    
		  <section title="Urban vs. Rural Areas">		
			  <t>The differences presented in the previous section are not 
        only present between countries, but within them too. This is 
        especially the case for rural inhabitants, who represent 
        approximately 55% of the world's population <xref target="IFAD2011"/>, 
        with 78% of them in "global south" countries <xref target="ITU2011"/>. According to 
        the World Bank, adoption gaps "between rural and urban populations 
        are falling for mobile phones but increasing for the internet" 
        <xref target="WorldBank2016"/>.</t>

        <t>Although it is impossible to generalize among them, there exist 
        some common features in rural areas that have prevented incumbent 
        operators from providing access and that, at the same time, challenge 
        the deployment of alternative infrastructures <xref target="Brewer"/>
        <xref target="Nungu"/> <xref target="Simo_c"/>. For example, a high
        network latency was reported in <xref target="Johnson_b"/>, which could be in the order of 
        seconds during some hours.</t>
            
        <t>These challenges include:</t>
        <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Low per capita income, as the local economy is mainly based on subsistence agriculture, farming,
          and fishing.</t>
          
          <t>Scarcity or absence of basic infrastructures, such as electricity, water, and access roads.</t>
          
          <t>Low population density and distance (spatial or effective) between population clusters.</t>
          
          <t>Underdeveloped social services, such as healthcare and education.</t>
          
          <t>Lack of adequately educated and trained technicians, and high potential for those (few) 
          trained to leave the community incentivized by better opportunities, higher salaries, or 
          the possibility of starting their own companies <xref target="McMahon"/>.</t>

          <t>High cost of Internet access <xref target="Mathee"/>.</t>
        
          <t>Harsh environments leading to failure in electronic communication devices <xref target="Johnson_a"/>,
          which reduces the reliability of the network.</t>
        </list></t>

        <t>Some of these factors challenge the stability of Alternative Networks and
        the services they provide: scarcity of spectrum, 
        scale, and heterogeneity of devices. However, the proliferation 
        of Alternative Networks <xref target="Baig"/> together with the raising of low-cost, 
        low-consumption, low-complexity off-the-shelf wireless devices have allowed 
        and simplified the deployment and maintenance of alternative infrastructures 
        in rural areas.</t>
		  </section>

      <section title="Topology Patterns Followed by Alternative Networks">
        <t>Alternative Networks, considered self-managed and self-sustained, follow different topology 
        patterns <xref target="Vega_a"/>. Generally, these networks
        grow spontaneously and organically, that is, the network grows
        without specific planning and deployment strategy and the routing
        core of the network tends to fit a power law distribution.
        Moreover, these networks are composed of a high number of heterogeneous
        devices with the common objective of freely connecting and increasing
        the network coverage and the reliability. Although these characteristics increase the
        entropy (e.g., by increasing the number of routing protocols), they
        have resulted in an inexpensive solution to effectively increase the
        network size. One such example is Guifi.net <xref target="Vega_a"/>, which has had an
        exponential growth rate in the number of operating nodes during the
        last decade.</t>

    	  <t>Regularly, rural areas in these networks are connected through long-distance
        links and/or wireless mesh networks, which in turn convey the Internet 
        connection to relevant 
    	  organizations or institutions. In contrast, in urban areas, users tend to share and require 
    	  mobile access. Since these areas are also likely to be covered by commercial ISPs, 
    	  the provision of wireless access by virtual operators like <xref target="Fon"/> 
    	  may constitute a way to extend the user capacity to the network. Other proposals like "Virtual 
    	  Public Networks" <xref target="Sathiaseelan_a"/> can also extend the 
    	  service.</t>
      </section>
	  </section>
     
	  <section title="Classification Criteria" anchor="criteria">           
      <t>The classification of Alternative Network Deployments, presented in this document,
        is based on the following criteria:</t>
    		
      <section title="Entity behind the Network"> 		
        <t>The entity (or entities) or individuals behind an Alternative
        Network can be:</t>
        		
          <t><list style="symbols">
        	  <t>A community of users.</t>
            <t>A public stakeholder.</t>
            <t>A private company.</t>   
        	  <t>Supporters of a crowdshared approach.</t>
            <t>A community that already owns the infrastructure and shares it 
            with an operator, who, in turn, may also use it for backhauling purposes.</t>
            <t>A research or academic entity.</t>
          </list></t>
      
        <t>The above actors may play different roles in the design, financing,
        deployment, governance, and promotion of an Alternative Network. For example,
        each of the members of a Community Network maintains the ownership over the
        equipment they have contributed, whereas in others there is a single entity,
        e.g., a private company who owns the equipment, or at least a part of it.</t>

        <t>Alternative Networks can be classified according to their purpose and the benefits 
        they bring compared to mainstream solutions, regarding economic, technological,
        social, or political objectives. These benefits could be enjoyed mostly by
        the actors involved (e.g., lowering costs or gaining technical
        expertise) or by the local community (e.g., Internet access in underserved areas) or by
        the society as a whole (e.g., network neutrality).</t>
        
        <t>The benefits provided by Alternative Networks include, but are not limited to:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Extending coverage to underserved areas (users and communities).</t>
          <t>Providing affordable Internet access for all.</t>
          <t>Reducing initial capital expenditures (for the network and the end user, or both).</t>
          <t>Providing additional sources of capital (beyond the traditional carrier-based financing).</t>
          <t>Reducing ongoing operational costs (such as backhaul or network administration).</t>
          <t>Leveraging expertise and having a place for experimentation and teaching.</t>
          <t>Reducing hurdles to adoption (e.g., digital literacy, literacy in general, and relevance).</t>
          <t>Providing an alternative service in case of natural disasters and 
          other extreme situations.</t>
          <t>Community building, social cohesion, and quality of life improvement.</t>
          <t>Experimentation with alternative governance and ownership
          models for treating network infrastructures as a commons.</t>
          <t>Raising awareness of political debates around issues like network
          neutrality, knowledge sharing, access to resources, and more.</t>
        </list></t>
      
        <t>Note that the different purposes of Alternative Networks can be more or less 
        explicitly stated and they could also evolve over time based on the internal 
        dynamics and external events. For example, the Red Hook WIFI network in Brooklyn
        <xref target="Redhook"/> started as a Community Network focusing more on local 
        applications and community building <xref target="TidePools"/>, but it became widely 
        known when it played a key role as an alternative service available 
        during the Sandy storm <xref target="Tech"/> <xref target="NYTimes"/>.</t>

        <t>Moreover, especially for those networks with more open and horizontal 
        governance models, the underlying motivations of those involved may be very 
        diverse, ranging from altruistic ones related to the desire of free sharing 
        of Internet connectivity and various forms of activism to personal benefits 
        from the experience and expertise through the active participation in the 
        deployment and management of a real and operational network.</t>

      <section title="Governance and Sustainability Model">  
        
        <t>Different governance models are present in Alternative Networks. They 
        may range from some open and horizontal models, with an active 
        participation of the users (e.g., Community Networks) to a more 
        centralized model, where a single authority (e.g., a company or a public 
        stakeholder) plans and manages the network, even if it is (total or 
        partially) owned by a community.</t>

        <t>Regarding sustainability, some networks grow "organically" as a result 
        of the new users who join and extend the network, contributing their own 
        hardware. In some other cases, the existence of previous 
        infrastructure (owned by the community or the users) may lower the capital expenditures 
        of an operator, who can therefore provide the service with better 
        economic conditions.</t>

			  <t>Community Networks are non-centralized, self-managed networks sharing these
			  characteristics:</t>
            
        <t><list style="symbols">			
			    <t>They start and grow organically, and they are open to participation
          from everyone, sharing an open participation agreement. Community members 
          directly contribute active (not just passive) network infrastructure.
          The network grows as new hosts and links are added.</t>
			
			    <t>Knowledge about building and maintaining the network and ownership of the 
			    network itself is non-centralized and open. Different
          degrees of centralization can be found in Community Networks. In some of them,
          a shared platform (e.g., a website) may exist where minimum coordination 
          is performed. Community members 
          with the right permissions have an obvious and direct 
			    form of organizational control over the overall organization of the network (e.g.,
          IP addresses, routing, etc.) in their 
			    community (not just their own participation in the network). </t>

			    <t>The network can serve as a backhaul for providing a whole range of services and 
			    applications, from completely free to even commercial services.</t>
        </list></t>
                
			  <t>Hardware and software used in Community Networks can be very diverse and customized,
        even inside one network. A Community Network can have both wired and
        wireless links. Multiple routing protocols or network topology management systems 
        may coexist in the network.</t>

			  <t>These networks grow organically, since they are formed by the aggregation of nodes
			  belonging to different users. A minimal governance infrastructure is required in order
			  to coordinate IP addressing, routing, etc. Several examples of Community Networks are 
        described in <xref target="Braem"/>. A technological analysis of a 
        Community Network is presented in <xref target="Vega_b"/>, which focuses on technological 
        network diversity, topology characteristics, the evolution of the network over time, 
        robustness and reliability, and networking service availability.</t>
        
        <t>These networks follow a participatory administration model, which has been 
        shown to be effective in connecting geographically 
			  dispersed people, thus enhancing and extending digital Internet rights.</t> 
     			
			  <t>Users adding new infrastructure (i.e., extensibility)
        can be used to formulate another definition: A Community Network is a
        network in which any participant in the system may add link segments
        to the network in such a way that the new segments can support
        multiple nodes and adopt the same overall characteristics as those of
        the joined network, including the capacity to further extend the
        network.  Once these link segments are joined to the network, there
        is no longer a meaningful distinction between the previous and the
        new extent of the network. The term "participant" 
        refers to an individual, who may become the user,
        provider, and manager of the network at the same time.</t>
			
	
		    <t>In Community Networks, profit can only be made by offering services and not simply 
        by supplying the infrastructure, because the infrastructure is neutral, free, and open (mainstream
        Internet Service Providers base their business on the control of the infrastructure).
        In Community Networks, everybody usually keeps the ownership of what he/she has contributed 
        or leaves the stewardship of the equipment to the network as a whole (the commons), even
        loosing track of the ownership of a particular equipment itself, in
        favor of the community.</t>	
		
		    <t>The majority of Community Networks comply with the definition of Free 
        Network, included in <xref target="Glossary"></xref>.</t>

			  <t>WISPs are commercially operated wireless Internet networks that
        provide Internet and/or Voice over Internet (VoIP) services. They are
        most common in areas not covered by mainstream telecommunications companies or ISPs. 
        WISPs mostly use wireless point-to-multipoint links using unlicensed 
        spectrum but often must resort to licensed frequencies. Use of
        licensed frequencies is common 
        in regions where unlicensed spectrum is either perceived to be crowded or 
        too unreliable to offer commercial services, or where unlicensed 
        spectrum faces regulatory barriers impeding its use.</t>

        <t>Most WISPs are operated by local companies responding to a perceived
        market gap. There is a small but growing number of WISPs, such as
        <xref target="Airjaldi"/> in India, that have expanded from
        local service into multiple locations.</t>

        <t>Since 2006, the deployment of cloud-managed WISPs has been possible
        with hardware from companies such as <xref target="Meraki"/> 
        and later <xref target="OpenMesh"/> and others. Until
        recently, however, most of these services have been aimed at
        "global north" markets. In 2014, a cloud-managed WISP service aimed at 
        "global south" markets was launched <xref target="Everylayer"/>.</t>

			  <t>In mainstream networks, the operator usually owns the telecommunications 
			  infrastructure required for the service or sometimes rents infrastructure 
			  to/from other companies. The problem arises in large areas with low population density, 
			  in which neither the operator nor the other companies have deployed infrastructure and 
			  such deployments are not likely to happen due to the low potential return on investment.</t>

			  <t>When users already own deployed infrastructure, either individually
        or as a community, sharing that infrastructure with an operator
        can benefit both parties and is a solution that has been deployed in some areas. 
        For the operator, this provides a
        significant reduction in the initial investment needed to provide
        services in small rural localities because capital expenditure is only
        associated with the access network. Renting capacity in the users'
        network for backhauling only requires an increment in the operating expenditure. This
        approach also benefits the users in two ways: they obtain improved
        access to telecommunications services that would not be 
        accessible otherwise, and they can derive some income from the operator that helps
        to offset the network's operating costs, particularly for network maintenance.</t>
            
			  <t>One clear example of the potential of the "shared infrastructure model" 
			  nowadays is the deployment of 3G services in rural areas in which there is a broadband 
			  rural Community Network. Since the inception of femtocells (small, low-power cellular 
        base stations), there are complete technical 
			  solutions for low-cost 3G coverage using the Internet as a backhaul. If a user or 
			  community of users has an IP network connected to the Internet with some excess capacity, 
			  placing a femtocell in the user premises benefits both the user and the 
			  operator, as the user obtains better coverage and the operator does not have to support
			  the cost of the backhaul infrastructure. Although this paradigm was conceived for improved indoor 
			  coverage, the solution is feasible for 3G coverage in underserved rural areas with 
			  low population density (i.e., villages), where the number of simultaneous users and 
			  the servicing area are small enough to use low-cost femtocells. Also, the amount of 
			  traffic produced by these cells can be easily transported by most community broadband 
			  rural networks.</t>
			
			  <t>Some real examples can be referenced in the TUCAN3G project, 
			  which deployed demonstrator networks in two regions 
			  in the Amazon forest in Peru <xref target="Simo_d"/>. In these networks 
                          <xref target="Simo_a"/>, the operator 
			  and several rural communities cooperated to provide services through rural networks 
			  built up with WiLD links <xref target="WiLD"/>. In these cases, the networks 
			  belonged to the public health authorities and were deployed with funds that came from 
			  international cooperation for telemedicine purposes. Publications that justify the 
			  feasibility of this approach can also be found on that website.</t>

			  <t>These networks can be defined as a set of nodes whose owners share common interests 
			  (e.g., sharing connectivity; resources; and peripherals) regardless of their physical location. 
			  They conform to the following approach: the home router creates two wireless networks --
			  one of them is normally used by the owner, and the other one is public. A small fraction of the 
			  bandwidth is allocated to the public network to be employed by any user of the service in the 
			  immediate area. Some examples are described in <xref target="PAWS"/> and
			  <xref target="Sathiaseelan_c"/>. Other examples are found in the networks created and managed 
        by city councils (e.g., <xref target="Heer"/>). The "openwireless movement" 
        (https://openwireless.org/) also promotes the sharing of private wireless networks.</t> 
			
			  <t>Some companies <xref target="Fon"/> also promote the use of Wi-Fi routers
        with dual access: a Wi-Fi network for the user and a shared one.
        Adequate Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) policies are implemented, so people can join the network in
        different ways: they can buy a router, so they can share their connection
        and in turn, they get access to all the routers associated with the
        community. Some users can even get some revenue every time another
        user connects to their Wi-Fi Access Point. Users that are not part of the community can buy 
        passes in order to use the network. Some mainstream telecommunications
        operators collaborate with these communities by including the functionality required to 
        create the two access networks in their routers. Some of these efforts are 
        surveyed in <xref target="Shi"/>.</t>
   
      
			  <t>The elements involved in a crowdshared network are summarized below:</t>
			
        <t><list style="symbols">
			  <t>Interest: A parameter capable of providing a measure (cost) of the attractiveness 
			  of a node in a specific location, at a specific instance in time.</t>
			
			  <t>Resources: A physical or virtual element of a global system. For instance, bandwidth; 
			  energy; data; and devices.</t>
			
			  <t>The owner: End users who sign up for the service and share their network capacity. 
        As a counterpart, they can access another owner's home network capacity for free. The owner can 
        be an end user or an entity (e.g., operator; virtual mobile network operator; 
        or municipality) that is to 
        be made responsible for any actions concerning his/her device.</t>
			
			  <t>The user: A legal entity or an individual using or requesting a publicly available 
			  electronic communications service for private or business purposes, without necessarily 
			  having subscribed to such service.</t>
          
			  <t>The VNO: An entity that acts in some aspects as a network coordinator. 
			  It may provide services such as initial authentication or registration and, eventually, 
			  trust relationship storage. A VNO is not an ISP given that it does not provide Internet 
			  access (e.g., infrastructure or naming). A VNO is not an Application Service Provider
			  (ASP) either since it does not provide user services. VNOs may also be stakeholders 
			  with socio-environmental objectives. They can be local governments, grassroots user 
			  communities, charities, or even content operators, smart grid operators, etc. They are 
			  the ones who actually run the service.</t>

        <t>A utility cooperative is a type of cooperative that delivers a public utility to its members. 
        For example, in the United States, rural electric cooperatives have provided electric service 
        starting in the 1930s, especially in areas where investor-owned utility would not provide service, 
        believing there would be insufficient revenue to justify the capital expenditures required. 
        Similarly, in many regions with low population density, traditional Internet Service Providers 
        such as telephone companies or cable TV companies are either not providing service at all or 
        only offering low-speed DSL service. Some rural electric cooperatives started installing fiber 
        optic lines to run their smart grid applications, but they found they could provide fiber-based 
        broadband to their members at little additional cost <xref target="Cash"/>. In some of these

			  <t>The vast majority of Alternative Network Deployments are based on different 
        wireless technologies <xref target="WNDW"/>. Below we summarize the options and trends when using these features 
        in Alternative Networks.</t>
      
    	  <section title="Media Access Control (MAC) Protocols for Wireless Links">	               
          <t>Different protocols for MAC, which also include physical 
          layer (PHY) recommendations, are widely used in Alternative Network Deployments.
          Wireless standards ensure interoperability and usability to those who
          design, deploy, and manage wireless networks. In addition, they then ensure the low cost 
          of equipment due to economies of scale and mass production.</t>

          <t>The standards used in the vast majority of Alternative Networks come from 
          the IEEE Standard Association's IEEE 802 Working Group. Standards developed 
          by other international entities can also be used, such as, e.g., the European 
          Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).</t>
                
    		  <section title="802.11 (Wi-Fi)">
              		
    			  <t>The standard we are most interested in is 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, as it 
    			  defines the protocol for Wireless LAN. It is also known as "Wi-Fi". 
            The original release (a/b) was issued in 1999 
            and allowed for rates up to 54 Mbit/s. The latest release (802.11ac) approved in 2013 
            reaches up to 866.7 Mbit/s. In 2012, the IEEE issued an 802.11 standard that 
            consolidated all the previous amendments <xref target="IEEE.802.11"/>. The document is freely downloadable from 
            <xref target="IEEE">the IEEE Standards Association</xref>.</t>

            <t>The MAC protocol in 802.11 is called CSMA/CA and was designed for short distances; the transmitter 
            expects the reception of an acknowledgment for each transmitted unicast packet and
            if a certain waiting time is exceeded, the packet is retransmitted.  This 
            behavior makes necessary the adaptation of several MAC parameters when 802.11 
            is used in long links <xref target="Simo_b"/>. Even with this adaptation, 
            distance has a significant negative impact on performance. For this reason, 
            many vendors implement alternative medium access techniques that are offered 
            alongside the standard CSMA/CA in their outdoor 802.11 products. These 
            alternative proprietary MAC protocols usually employ some 
            type of TDMA. Low-cost equipment using these 
            techniques can offer high throughput at distances above 100 kilometers.</t>
        
            <t>Different specifications of 802.11 operate in different frequency bands. 802.11b/g/n operates
            in 2.4 GHz, but 802.11a/n/ac operates in 5 GHz. This fact is used in some Community Networks
            in order to separate ordinary and "backbone" nodes:</t>
          
            <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>Typical routers running mesh firmware in homes, offices, and public spaces operate at 2.4 GHz.</t>
              <t>Special routers running mesh firmware as well but broadcasting
              and receiving on the 5 GHz band are used in point-to-point connections only. They
              are helpful to create a "backbone" on the network that can both
              connect neighborhoods to one another when reasonable connections
              with 2.4 GHz nodes are not possible, and they ensure that users of 2.4 GHz
              nodes are within a few hops to strong and stable connections to
              the rest of the network.</t>

    		  <section title="Mobile Technologies">
    			  <t>Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), from ETSI, has also been used 
            in Alternative Networks as a Layer 2 option, as explained 
            in <xref target="Mexican"/>, <xref target="Village"/>, and <xref target="Heimerl"/>.
            Open source GSM code projects such as OpenBTS (http://openbts.org) or OpenBSC
            (http://openbsc.osmocom.org/trac/) have created an ecosystem with 
            the participation of several companies such as, e.g., <xref target="Rangenetworks"/>,
            <xref target="Endaga"/>, and <xref target="YateBTS"/>. This enables deployments
            of voice, SMS, and Internet services over Alternative Networks with
            an IP-based backhaul.</t>

            <t>Internet navigation is usually restricted
            to relatively low bit rates (see, e.g., <xref target="Osmocom"/>). However,
            leveraging on the evolution of Third Generation Partnership Project
            (3GPP) standards, a trend can be observed towards the integration of 4G
            <xref target="Spectrum"/> <xref target="YateBTS"/>
            or 5G <xref target="Openair"/> functionalities, with significant increase
            of achievable bit rates.</t>

            <t>Depending on factors such as the allocated frequency band, the
            adoption of licensed spectrum can have advantages over the
            eventually higher frequencies used for Wi-Fi, in terms of signal
            propagation and, consequently, coverage. Other factors favorable
            to 3GPP technologies, especially GSM, are the low cost and energy
            consumption of handsets, which facilitate its use by
            low-income communities.</t>

    			  <t>Some Alternative Networks make use of TV White Spaces <xref target="Lysko"/>
                          -- a set of UHF and VHF 
    			  television frequencies that can be utilized by secondary users in locations 
    			  where they are unused by licensed primary users such as television broadcasters. 
    			  Equipment that makes use of TV White Spaces is required to detect the presence 
    			  of existing unused TV channels by means of a spectrum database and/or spectrum 
    			  sensing in order to ensure that no harmful interference is caused to primary 
    			  users. In order to smartly allocate interference-free channels to the devices, 
    			  cognitive radios are used that are able to modify their frequency, power, and 
    			  modulation techniques to meet the strict operating conditions required for 
    			  secondary users.</t>

					  <t>The use of the term "White Spaces" is often used to describe "TV White Spaces" 
					  as the VHF and UHF television frequencies were the first to be exploited on a 
					  secondary use basis. There are two dominant standards for TV White Space 
					  communication: (i) the 802.11af standard <xref target="IEEE.802.11AF"/>
					  -- an adaptation of the 802.11 
					  standard for TV White Space bands -- and (ii) the IEEE 802.22 standard 
					  <xref target="IEEE.802.22"/> for long-range rural communication.</t>
    				
        	  <section title="802.11af">
        		  <t>802.11af <xref target="IEEE.802.11AF"/> is a modified version 
        		  of the 802.11 standard operating in 
        		  TV White Space bands using cognitive radios to avoid interference with 
        		  primary users. The standard is often referred to as "White-Fi" or "Super 
        		  Wi-Fi" and was approved in February 2014. 802.11af contains much of the 
        		  advances of all the 802.11 standards including recent advances in 802.11ac 
        		  such as up to four bonded channels, four spatial streams, and very high-rate 
        		  256 QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) but with 
                          improved in-building penetration and 
        		  outdoor coverage. The maximum data rate achievable is 426.7 Mbit/s for 
        		  countries with 6/7 MHz channels and 568.9 Mbit/s for countries with 8 MHz 
        		  channels. Coverage is typically limited to 1 km although longer range 
        		  at lower throughput and using high gain antennas will be possible.</t>

						  <t>Devices are designated as enabling stations (Access Points) or dependent 
						  stations (clients). Enabling stations are authorized to control the 
						  operation of a dependent station and securely access a geolocation database. 
						  Once the enabling station has received a list of available White Space 
						  channels, it can announce a chosen channel to the dependent stations for 
						  them to communicate with the enabling station. 802.11af also makes use 
						  of a registered location server -- a local database that organizes the 
						  geographic location and operating parameters of all enabling stations.</t>

					  <section title="802.22">
    				  <t>802.22 <xref target="IEEE.802.22"/> is a standard developed specifically for long-range rural 
    				  communications in TV White Space frequencies and was first approved in July 
    				  2011. The standard is similar to the 802.16 (WiMax)
    				  <xref target="IEEE.802.16"/> standard with an 
    				  added cognitive radio ability. The maximum throughput of 802.22 is
						  22.6 Mbit/s for a single 8 MHz channel using 64-QAM modulation. The 
						  achievable range using the default MAC scheme is 30 km; however, 100 
						  km is possible with special scheduling techniques. The MAC of 802.22 
						  is specifically customized for long distances -- for example, slots in 
						  a frame destined for more distant Consumer Premises Equipment (CPE) 
                                                  are sent before slots destined for nearby CPEs.</t>

						  <t>Base stations are required to have a Global Positioning System (GPS) 
              and a connection to the Internet in order to query a geolocation spectrum 
              database. Once the base station receives the allowed TV channels, it communicates a 
						  preferred operating TV White Space channel with the CPE devices. The 
                                                  standard also includes a coexistence mechanism 
						  that uses beacons to make other 802.22 base stations aware of the 
						  presence of a base station that is not part of the same network.</t>

			  <section title="IP Addressing">
				  <t>Most Community Networks use private IPv4 address ranges, as defined by <xref target="RFC1918"></xref>. 
          The motivation for this was the lower cost and the simplified 
	        IP allocation because of the large available address ranges.</t>
        
          <t>Most known Alternative Networks started in or around the year 2000. IPv6 was fully specified 
				  by then, but almost all Alternative Networks still use IPv4. A survey <xref target="Avonts">
				  </xref> indicated that IPv6 rollout presented a challenge to Community Networks.
          However, some of them have already adopted it, such as ninux.org.</t>
			  </section>

			  <section title="Routing Protocols">
				  <t>As stated in previous sections, Alternative Networks are composed of possibly different 
          Layer 2 devices, resulting in a mesh 
				  of nodes. A connection between different nodes is not guaranteed, and the link 
				  stability can vary strongly over time. To tackle this, some Alternative Networks 
          use mesh routing protocols for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs), while other
          ones use more traditional routing protocols. Some networks 
				  operate multiple routing protocols in parallel. For example, they may use a mesh protocol inside different 
				  islands and rely on traditional routing protocols to connect these islands.</t>

				  <section title="Traditional Routing Protocols">
					  <t>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), as defined by <xref target="RFC4271"></xref>,
            is used by a number of Community Networks because of its well-studied behavior and 
            scalability.</t>
					
					  <t>For similar reasons, smaller networks opt to run the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
            protocol, as defined by <xref target="RFC2328"></xref>.</t>
				  </section>
				
				  <section title="Mesh Routing Protocols">			
					  <t>A large number of Alternative Networks use customized versions of the Optimized Link 
            State Routing (OLSR) Protocol <xref target="RFC3626"/>. The open

            Count (ETX) metric <xref target="Couto"/> and other features for its
            use in Alternative Networks, especially wireless ones. A new version of the protocol,

          be taken with the management of the traffic at upper layers. From a crowdshared
