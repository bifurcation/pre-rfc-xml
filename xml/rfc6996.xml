    <abstract>
    <t>This document describes the reservation of Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) that are for Private Use only, known as Private Use ASNs, and provides operational guidance on their use.  This document enlarges the total space available for Private Use ASNs by documenting the reservation of a second, larger range and updates RFC 1930 by replacing Section 10 of that document.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
	    <t>The original IANA reservation of Autonomous System Numbers
(ASNs) for Private Use was a block of 1023 ASNs.  This was also documented by
the IETF in Section 10 of <xref target="RFC1930" />.  Since the time that the range
was reserved, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) <xref target="RFC4271" /> has
seen deployment in new application domains, such as data center networks, which
require a larger Private Use AS space.</t>
	    <t>Since the introduction of "BGP Support for Four-Octet Autonomous
System (AS) Number Space" <xref target="RFC6793" />, the total size of  ASN space has increased
dramatically. A larger subset of the space is available to network
operators to deploy in these Private Use cases.  The existing range of Private
Use ASNs is widely deployed, and the ability to renumber this resource in 
existing networks cannot be coordinated given that these ASNs, by definition, are
not registered.  Therefore, this RFC documents the existing Private Use ASN
reservation while also introducing a second, larger range that can also be
utilized.</t> 
    </section>
     <section title="Requirements Language">
       <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC
2119</xref>.</t> 
     </section>
    <section anchor="addr" title="Private Use ASNs">
	    <t>To allow the continued growth of BGP protocol usage in new
network applications that utilize Private Use ASNs, two ranges of ASNs are
reserved by <xref target="IANA" /> of this document.  The first is part of the
original 16-bit Autonomous System range previously
defined in <xref target="RFC1930" />, and the second is a larger range out of
the Four-Octet AS Number Space <xref target="RFC6793" />.</t> 
    </section>
    <section anchor="ops" title="Operational Considerations">
	    <t>If Private Use ASNs are used and prefixes originate from
these ASNs, Private Use ASNs MUST be removed from AS path attributes (including
AS4_PATH if utilizing a four-octet AS number space) before being advertised to
the global Internet.  Operators SHOULD ensure that all External Border Gateway
Protocol (EBGP) speakers support the extensions described in <xref target="RFC6793" /> and that
implementation-specific features that recognize Private Use ASNs have been
updated to recognize both ranges prior to making use of the newer, numerically
higher range of Private Use ASNs in the four-octet AS number space.  Some
existing implementations that remove Private Use ASNs from the AS_PATH are
known to not remove Private Use ASNs if the AS_PATH contains a mixture of
Private Use and Non-Private Use ASNs.  If such implementations have not been
updated to recognize the new range of ASNs in this document and a mix of old
and new range Private Use ASNs exist in the AS4_PATH, these implementations
will likely cease to remove any Private Use ASNs from either of the AS path
attributes.  Normal AS path filtering MAY also be used to prevent prefixes
originating from Private Use ASNs from being advertised to the global
Internet.</t> 
    </section>
   <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
	   <t>IANA has reserved, for Private Use, a contiguous block of 1023
Autonomous System numbers from the "16-bit Autonomous System Numbers" registry,
namely 64512 - 65534 inclusive.</t> 

	   <t>IANA has also reserved, for Private Use, a contiguous block of
94,967,295 Autonomous System numbers from the "32-bit Autonomous System Numbers"
registry, namely 4200000000 - 4294967294 inclusive.</t> 
	   <t>These reservations have been documented in the IANA "Autonomous
System (AS) Numbers" registry <xref target="IANA.AS"/>.</t> 
   </section>
   <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
	   <t>Private Use ASNs do not raise any unique security concerns.  Loss 
of connectivity might result from their inappropriate use, specifically outside
of a single organization, since they are not globally unique.  This loss of
connectivity is limited to the organization using Private Use ASNs
inappropriately or without reference to <xref target="ops" />.  General BGP
security considerations are discussed in <xref target="RFC4271" /> and <xref
target="RFC4272" />.  Identification of the originator of a route with a Private Use
ASN in the AS path would have to be done by tracking the route back to the
neighboring globally unique AS in the path or by inspecting other
attributes.</t>
