        <abstract><t>
   This memo documents a process intended to organize the future
   development of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and related
   work in the Real-time Applications and Infrastructure (RAI) Area. 
As the environments in which SIP is deployed grow more numerous and
   diverse, modifying or extending SIP in certain ways may threaten
   the interoperability and security of the protocol; however, the
   IETF process must also cater to the realities of existing
   deployments and serve the needs of the implementers working with
   SIP. This document therefore defines the functions of two long-lived
   working groups in the RAI Area that are, respectively, responsible
   for the maintenance of the core SIP specifications and the development
   of new efforts to extend and apply work in this space. This
   document obsoletes RFC 3427.
        </t></abstract>

        <section anchor="history" title="History and Development">
	<t>
	The <xref target="RFC3261">Session Initiation Protocol
	(SIP)</xref> has grown well beyond its origins in
	Internet-based   multimedia sessions and now enjoys
	widespread popularity in Voice-over-IP or IP telephony
	applications, both inside IETF and within other standards
	groups.  One result of this popularity has been a continual
	flood of proposals for SIP modifications and extensions.
	The challenge for IETF management of SIP has been to preserve
	baseline interoperability across its many implementations

        </t><t>
In order to defend SIP against changes that might reduce
interoperability, the working group chairs and Area Directors
responsible for its management authored the <xref target="RFC3427">SIP
change process</xref>. That document defined the role of the
SIP and SIPPING Working Groups (WGs) in shepherding ongoing work on the SIP
standard. It also defined ways that external working groups or bodies
can define extensions intended for limited usage, especially through
the "P-" header field mechanism.

        </t><t>
Over time, however, the management structure of RFC 3427 has
demonstrated some limitations. The first and most significant of these
concerns "P-" header fields. While "P-" header fields require expert
review and IESG shepherding, in practice IETF oversight of these
header fields is quite limited, and the value added by the IETF
supervising their development remains unclear. More importantly, the
presence of a "P-" in front of a header field name does nothing to
prevent a popular header field from seeing deployment outside of the
original "limited usage" it envisioned; a prominent example of this
today is the P-Asserted-Identity (PAID) header field, described
in <xref target="RFC3325">RFC3325</xref>.

        </t><t>
Consequently, this document obsoletes RFC 3427 and
describes a new structure for the management of deliverables in the
Real-time Applications and Infrastructure Area.
	</t>

        <section anchor="sipwg" title="The IETF SIPCORE Working Group">
	<t>
   Historically, the IETF SIP Working Group (sip) was chartered to be
   the "owner" of the <xref target="RFC3261">SIP protocol</xref> for
   the duration of the working group.  All changes or extensions to
   SIP were first required to exist as SIP Working Group documents.
   The SIP Working Group was charged with being the guardian of the
   SIP protocol for the Internet, and therefore was mandated only to
   extend or change the SIP protocol when there were compelling reasons
   to do so.
        </t><t>
The SIPCORE Working Group replaces the function of the SIP Working
Group in the original <xref target="RFC3427" /> account.
   Documents that must be handled by the SIPCORE Working Group include
all documents that update or obsolete RFCs 3261 through 3265 or their
successors.  All SIP extensions considered in SIPCORE must be
Standards Track. They may be based upon requirements developed
externally in other IETF working groups.

        </t><t>
Typical IETF working groups do not live forever;  however, SIPCORE's
charter is open-ended in order to allow it to remain the place where
core SIP development will continue.  In the event that the SIPCORE
Working Group has closed and no suitable replacement or follow-on
working group is active (and this specification also has not been
superseded), then when modifications to the core SIP protocol are
proposed, the RAI Area Directors will use the non-working-group
Standards Track document process (described in Section 6.1.2
of <xref target="RFC2026">RFC 2026</xref>) using the SIPCORE mailing
list and Designated Experts from the SIP community for review.

        </t><t>
   It is appropriate for any IETF working group to
   develop <xref target="RFC3265">SIP event packages</xref>, but the
   working group must have charter approval to do so.  The
   IETF will also require <xref target="RFC5226" /> IETF Review for the registration of
   event packages developed outside the scope of an IETF working group.
   Instructions for event package registrations are provided in
   <xref target="event"/>.
	</t>
        </section>


        <section anchor="sipping" title="The IETF DISPATCH Working Group">
	<t>
   Historically, the IETF Session Initiation Protocol Proposal Investigation (sipping)
   Working Group was chartered to be a filter in front of the SIP Working
   Group.  This working group investigated requirements for
   applications of SIP, some of which led to requests for
   extensions to SIP.  These requirements may come from the community at
   large or from individuals who are reporting the requirements as
   determined by another standards body.
        </t><t>
The DISPATCH Working Group replaces the function of the SIPPING WG,
although with several important changes to its functionality -- the most
notable being that its scope expands beyond just SIP to the entire
work of the RAI Area. Like SIPPING, DISPATCH considers new proposals
for work in the RAI Area, but rather than taking on specification
deliverables as charter items itself, DISPATCH identifies the proper
venue for work. If no such venue yet exists in the RAI Area, DISPATCH
will develop charters and consensus for a BoF, working group,
or <xref target="RFC5111">exploratory group</xref> as
appropriate. Unlike the previous change structure, a DISPATCH review
of any proposed change to core SIP is not required before it
progresses to SIPCORE; however, any new proposed work that does not
clearly fall within the charter of an existing RAI Area effort should
be examined by DISPATCH.

        </t><t>
In reaction to a proposal, the DISPATCH Working Group may determine
that: <list style="numbers">

<t>these requirements justify a change to the core SIP
specifications (RFCs 3261 through 3265) and thus any resulting work
must transpire in SIPCORE;</t>
<t>these requirements do not change the SIP
core specifications but require a new effort in the RAI Area (be that
a working group, a BoF, or what have you);</t>
<t>these requirements fall within the scope of existing chartered work
  in the RAI Area; or</t>
<t>the proposal should not be acted upon at this time.</t> </list>

Because the SIP protocol gets so much attention, some application
   designers may want to use it just because it is there, such as for
   controlling household appliances.  DISPATCH should act as a filter,
   accepting only proposals that play to the strengths of SIP, not
those that confuse its applicability or ultimately reduce its
usefulness as a means for immediate personal communications on the
Internet.
        </t><t>
In practice, it is expected that the DISPATCH WG behaves as a RAI
"Open Area" working group, similar to those employed in other areas of
the IETF. While it does not have the traditional deliverables of a
working group, DISPATCH may, at the discretion of its chairs and Area
Directors, adopt milestones in accordance with standard working group
milestone-adoption procedures, such as the production of charter text
for a BoF or working group, a "-00" problem statement document that
explicates a proposed work effort, or a document explaining why a
particular direction for standards development was not pursued. 
	</t>
        </section>
        </section>
        <section title="Terminology">
            <t>
In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD",
and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as described in
<xref target="RFC2119"/>. This document additionally uses
<xref target="RFC5226"/> language to describe IANA registrations.
	</t>

        </section>

        <section anchor="change" title="Introducing New Work to RAI">
	<t>
   As with any new work in the IETF, proposals are best formulated in
   individual Internet-Drafts. New ideas arising within the chartered
   scope of a RAI Area working group naturally should be treated as
   candidates for adoption as a working group item there. Experience has
   demonstrated that authoring a problem statement or set of initial
   requirements prior to (or at least separately from) submitting a
   protocol mechanism speeds the consensus-making process significantly.
   A problem statement should explain what problem needs to be solved,
   why existing mechanisms are insufficient, and, for proposals to
   modify SIP, why SIP is the appropriate solution for this problem. A
   problem statement must also detail any security issues that may
   result from meeting these requirements. When proposed new work does
   not fall within the bounds of existing RAI Area working group
   charters, the DISPATCH Working Group assists the authors
   of proposals, the RAI Area Directors and the RAI community to decide
   the best way to approach the problem. Authors of proposals may submit
   their problem statements to the DISPATCH Working Group for community
   consideration and review.
        </t><t>
 The DISPATCH Working Group chairs, in conjunction with the RAI Area
   Directors, will determine if the particular problems raised in the
   requirements problem statement are indeed outside the charter of
 existing efforts and, if so, if they warrant a DISPATCH milestone for
 the definition of a new effort; this DISPATCH deliverable may take
 the form of a problem statement Internet-Draft, charter, or similar
 milestone that provides enough information to make a decision, but must not include protocol
 development.  The DISPATCH Working Group should consider whether the
 requirements can be merged with other requirements from other
 applications, and refine the problem statement accordingly.

        </t><t>
   Once a new effort has been defined in DISPATCH and there is working
   group consensus that it should go forward, if the new effort will
   take the form of a working group or BoF, then the ADs will present
   the proposed new effort charter to the IESG and IAB, in accordance
   with the usual chartering process. If the new effort involves the
   rechartering of an existing working group, then similarly the
   existing working group rechartering functions will be performed by
   the appropriate WG chairs and ADs. If the IESG (with IAB advice)
   approves of the new charter or BoF, the DISPATCH Working Group has
   completed its deliverable and the new effort becomes autonomous.

        </t><t>
Anyone proposing requirements for new work is welcome to jointly
develop, in a separate Internet-Draft, a mechanism that would meet the
requirements.  No working group is required to adopt the proposed
solution from this additional Internet-Draft.
        </t><t>
  Work overseen by the SIPCORE Working Group is required to protect the architectural
   integrity of SIP and must not add features that do not have general
   use beyond the specific case.  Also, SIPCORE must not add features just
   to make a particular function more efficient at the expense of
   simplicity or robustness.
        </t><t>
  The DISPATCH process is not the sole place that requirements for
  new work are considered in the RAI Area. For example, some working
  groups generate requirements for SIP solutions and/or
  extensions.  At the time this document was written, groups with
  such chartered deliverables include SIP for Instant Messaging and
  Presence Leveraging Extensions (simple), Basic Level of
  Interoperability for SIP Services (bliss) and Session Peering for
  Multimedia Interconnect (speermint). The work of these and similar
  groups is not affected by the DISPATCH process.
        </t><t>
   Of course, the RAI Area Directors may accept charter revisions
   from existing working groups that add new milestones or scope to
   their charters at their discretion, in the standard IETF manner,
   without any actions on the part of the DISPATCH Working Group.
   DISPATCH exists to assist new work in finding a home expeditiously
   in those cases where it does not naturally fall into an existing
   bucket.
	</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="extend" title="Extensibility and Architecture">
	<t>
   In an idealized protocol model, extensible design would be
   self-contained, and it would be inherent that new extensions and new
   header fields would naturally have an architectural coherence with the
   original protocol.
        </t><t>
  However, this idealized vision has not been attained in the world of
   Standards Track protocols.  While interoperability implications can
   be addressed by capabilities negotiation rules, the effects of adding
   features that overlap, or that deal with a point solution and are
   not general, are much harder to control with rules.  Therefore, the RAI Area
   calls for architectural guardianship and application of Occam's Razor
   by the SIPCORE and DISPATCH Working Groups.
        </t><t>
   In keeping with the IETF tradition of "running code and rough
   consensus", it is valid to allow for the development of SIP
   extensions that are either not ready for Standards Track, but might
   be understood for that role after some running code or are private
   or proprietary in nature because a characteristic motivating them is
   usage that is known not to fit the Internet architecture for
   SIP. In the past, header fields associated with those extensions
   were called "P-" header fields for "preliminary", "private", or "proprietary".
        </t><t>
However, the "P-" header field process has not served the purpose for
which it was designed -- namely, to restrict to closed environments the
usage of mechanisms the IETF would not (yet) endorse for general
usage. In fact, some "P-" header fields have enjoyed widespread
implementation; because of the "P-" prefix, however, there seems to be
no plausible migration path to designate these as general-usage header
fields without trying to force implausible changes on large installed
bases. 
        </t><t>
Accordingly, this specification deprecates the previous
<xref target="RFC3427" />
guidance on the creation of "P-" header fields. Existing "P-" header
fields are to be handled by user agents and proxy servers as the "P-"
header field specifications describe; the deprecation of the change
process mechanism entails no change in protocol behavior. New
proposals to document SIP header fields of an experimental or private
nature, however, shall not use the "P-" prefix (unless existing
deployments or standards use the prefix already, in which case they
may be admitted as grandfathered cases at the discretion of the
Designated Expert).
        </t><t>

Instead, the registration of SIP header fields in Informational RFCs,
or in documents outside the IETF, is now permitted under the
Designated Expert (per <xref target="RFC5226" />) criteria. The future use of any header
field name prefix ("P-" or "X-" or what have you) to designate
SIP header fields of limited applicability is discouraged. Experts are
advised to review documents for overlap with existing chartered work
in the RAI Area, and are furthermore instructed to ensure the
following two criteria are met:

        </t><t><list style="numbers"><t>
    The proposed header field MUST be of a purely informational nature and
       MUST NOT significantly change the behavior of SIP entities that
       support it.  Header fields that merely provide additional information
       pertinent to a request or a response are acceptable; these
    header fields are thus expected to have few, if any, implications
    for interoperability and backwards compatibility. Similarly,
    header fields that provide data consumed by applications at the
    ends of SIP's rendezvous function, rather than changing the
    behavior of the rendezvous function, are likely to be providing information
    in this sense.  If the header fields redefine or contradict
    normative behavior defined in Standards Track SIP specifications,
    that is what is meant by significantly different
    behavior. Ultimately, the significance of differences in behavior
    is a judgment call that must be made by the expert reviewer. 

        </t><t>
The proposed header field MUST NOT undermine SIP security in any sense.
       The Internet-Draft proposing the new header field MUST address security
       issues in detail, as if it were a Standards Track document.  Note
       that, if the intended application scenario makes certain
       assumptions regarding security, the security considerations only
       need to meet the intended application scenario rather than the
       general Internet case.  In any case, security issues need to be
       discussed for arbitrary usage scenarios (including the general
       Internet case).
        </t></list></t><t>
Note that the deprecation of the "P-" header field process does not
alter processes for the registration of SIP methods, URI parameters,
response codes, or option tags.
        </t>

        <section anchor="event" title="SIP Event Packages">
	<t>
   SIP events <xref target="RFC3265"/> defines two different types of event packages: normal
   event packages and event template-packages.  Event template-packages
   can only be created and registered by the publication of a Standards
   Track RFC (from an IETF Working Group). Note that the guidance in
   <xref target="RFC3265" />
   states that the IANA registration policy for normal event packages is
   "First Come First Serve"; this document replaces that policy with the
   following:
        </t><t>
   Individuals may wish to publish SIP Event packages that they
   believe fall outside the scope of any chartered work currently in
   RAI.  Individual proposals for registration of a SIP event package MUST first be
   published as Internet-Drafts for review by the DISPATCH Working Group,
   or the working group, mailing list, or expert designated by the RAI
   Area Directors if the DISPATCH Working Group has closed.  Proposals
   should include a strong motivational section, a thorough description
   of the proposed syntax and semantics, event package considerations,
   security considerations, and examples of usage.  Authors should
   submit their proposals as individual Internet-Drafts and post
   an announcement to the working group mailing list to begin
   discussion.  The DISPATCH Working Group will determine if a proposed
   package is <list style="format %c)">
<t>an appropriate usage of SIP that should be spun into a new
  effort, </t>
<t>applicable to SIP but not sufficiently interesting, general, or in-scope to adopt as a
   working group effort,</t>
<t>contrary to similar work chartered in an existing effort, or</t>
<t>recommended to be adopted as or merged with chartered work elsewhere in RAI.</t></list>
      </t><t>
  "RFC Required" in conjunction with "Designated Expert" (both as
  defined in RFC 5226) is the procedure for registration of event
   packages developed outside the scope of an IETF working group,
   according to the following guidelines:
      <list style="numbers"><t>
    A Designated Expert (as defined in RFC 5226) must review
       the proposal for applicability to SIP and conformance with these
       guidelines.  The Designated Expert will send email to the IESG on
       this determination.  The expert reviewer can cite one or more of
       the guidelines that have not been followed in his/her opinion.

      </t><t>
   The proposed extension MUST NOT define an event template-package.
      </t><t>
     The function of the proposed package MUST NOT overlap with
       current or planned chartered packages.
      </t><t>
     The event package MUST NOT redefine or contradict the normative
       behavior of SIP events <xref target="RFC3265"/>, SIP
     <xref target="RFC3261"/>, or related Standards Track
       extensions. (See <xref target="extend"/>.)
      </t><t>
    The proposed package MUST NOT undermine SIP security in any
       sense.  The Internet-Draft proposing the new package MUST address
       security issues in detail as if it were a Standards Track
       document.  Security issues need to be discussed for arbitrary
       usage scenarios (including the general Internet case).
      </t><t>
  The proposed package MUST be clearly documented in an
       (Individual) Informational RFC and registered with IANA.  The
       package MUST document all the package considerations required in
       Section 4 of SIP events <xref target="RFC3265"/>.
      </t><t>
 If determined by the Designated Expert or the chairs or ADs of
       the DISPATCH WG, an applicability statement in the Informational
       RFC MUST clearly document the useful scope of the proposal, and
       explain its limitations and why it is not suitable for the
       general use of SIP in the Internet.

   Complex, indeterminate, and hard-to-define protocol behavior,
   depending on the interaction of many optional extensions, is a fine breeding
   ground for security flaws.
        </t><t>
All Internet-Drafts that present new requirements for SIP must
   include a discussion of the security requirements and implications
   inherent in the proposal.  All RFCs that modify or extend SIP must
   show that they have adequate security, must consider the security
implications of feature interactions, and most of all must not worsen
SIP's existing security considerations.
	</t>
        </section>


        <section title="IANA Considerations">
        <t>
   RFC 3261 directs the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
   to establish a registry for SIP method names, a registry for SIP
   option tags, and a registry for SIP response codes, and to amend the
   practices used for the existing registry for SIP header fields.
   Reiterating the guidance of RFC 3261, method names, option tags, and
 SIP response codes require a Standards Action for inclusion in the
   IANA registry. Authors of specifications should also be aware that
   the SIP parameter registry is further elaborated
   in <xref target="RFC3968"></xref>.
        </t><t>
Previously in RFC 3427, all new SIP header field
registrations required a Standards Action (per RFC 5226) with the
exception of "P-" header fields; now, Informational registration of
non-"P-" header fields is permitted if approved by a Designated
Expert, as described in <xref target="extend"/>.
        </t><t>
   Each RFC shall include an IANA Considerations section that directs
   IANA to create appropriate registrations.  Registration shall be done
   at the time the IESG announces its approval of the draft containing
   the registration requests.
        </t><t>
Standard header fields and messages MUST NOT begin with the leading
   characters "P-". Existing "P-" header field registrations are
considered grandfathered, but new registrations of Informational
header fields should not begin with the leading characters "P-"
(unless the "P-" would preserve compatibility with a pre-existing,
unregistered usage of the header field, at the discretion the
Designated Expert). Short forms of header fields MUST only be assigned
to Standards Track header fields. 
        </t><t>
   Similarly, <xref target="RFC3265"></xref> directs the IANA to establish a registry for
   SIP event packages and SIP event template-packages.  For event
   template-packages, registrations must follow the
   <xref target="RFC5226" /> processes
   for Standards Action within an IETF working group.  For normal event packages, as stated
   previously, registrations minimally require <xref target="RFC5226"
   /> "RFC Required" with "Designated Expert".  In either case, the
   IESG announcement of RFC approval authorizes IANA to make the
   registration.

   parameters; however, Section 3 of that same document mandates that a
   Standards Action is required to register new parameters with the
   IANA.  This contradiction arose from a misunderstanding of the nature
   of the <xref target="RFC2434" /> categories; the intention was for the IANA
   Considerations to mandate that Standards Action is required.

	<section title="Overview of Changes to RFC 3427">

	<t>This section provides a high-level overview of the changes
	between this document and RFC 3427. It is not a
	substitute for the document as a whole -- the details are
	necessarily not represented.</t>

	<t>This document:
	  
          <list style="numbers">
	    
	    <t>Changes the description of the SIP
              and SIPPING WG functions to the SIPCORE and DISPATCH WG
              functions using the context of the RAI Area.</t>
	    
	    <t>
              Deprecates the process for "P-" header field registration, and
              changes the requirements for registration of SIP header
              fields of a purely informational nature.</t>
	    
	    <t>
              Updates IANA registry requirements, reflecting the publication
              of RFC 5226, clarifying the policies in RFC 3969, and
              clarifying that the original RFC 3237 updated the
              policies in RFC 3265.</t>

 The credit for the notion that SIP required careful management
 belongs to the original authors: Allison
   Mankin, Scott Bradner, Rohan Mahy, Dean Willis, Joerg Ott, and Brian
   Rosen.  The current editors have provided only an update
   to reflect lessons learned from running the code and from the
 changing situation of the IETF and the IANA
   registration procedures. Gonzalo Camarillo was instrumental to the
 development of the concept of SIPCORE and DISPATCH. Useful comments
 were provided by Jonathan Rosenberg, Mary Barnes, Dan York, John
 Elwell, Alan Johnston, Spencer Dawkins, Alfred Hoenes, Russ Housley,
 and Dean Willis. The thorough review from Stephen Hanna of the
 Security Directorate proved enormously valuable. The authors also
 appreciated IESG feedback from Alexey Melnikov, Adrian Farrel, Dan
 Romascanu, and Magnus Westerlund.
        </t><t>
   The original authors thanked their IESG and IAB colleagues
   (especially Randy Bush, Harald Alvestrand, John Klensin, Leslie
   Daigle, Patrik Faltstrom, and Ned Freed) for valuable discussions of
   extensibility issues in a wide range of protocols, including those
   that our area brings forward and others.  Thanks to the many members
   of the SIP community engaged in interesting dialogue about this
   document as well, including and especially Jonathan Rosenberg,
   Henning Schulzrinne, and William Marshall.
