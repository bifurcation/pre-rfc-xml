      <t>This memo provides clear definitions for Active and Passive
      performance assessment. The construction of Metrics and Methods can be
      described as either "Active" or "Passive". Some methods may use a subset
      of both Active and Passive attributes, and we refer to these as "Hybrid
      Methods". This memo also describes multiple dimensions to help evaluate
      new methods as they emerge.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The adjectives "Active" and "Passive" have been used for many years
      to distinguish between two different classes of Internet performance
      assessment. The first Passive and Active Measurement (PAM) Conference
      was held in 2000, but the earliest proceedings available online are from
      the second PAM conference in 2001
      &lt;https://www.ripe.net/ripe/meetings/pam-2001&gt;.</t>

      <t>The notions of "Active" and "Passive" are well-established. In
      general:<list style="symbols">
          <t>An Active metric or method depends on a dedicated measurement
          packet stream and observations of the stream.</t>

          <t>A Passive metric or method depends *solely* on observation of one
          or more existing packet streams. The streams only serve measurement
          when they are observed for that purpose, and are present whether or
          not measurements take place.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>As new techniques for assessment emerge, it is helpful to have clear
      definitions of these notions. This memo provides more-detailed
      definitions, defines a new category for combinations of traditional
      Active and Passive techniques, and discusses dimensions to evaluate new
      techniques as they emerge.</t>

      <t>This memo provides definitions for Active and Passive Metrics and
      Methods based on long usage in the Internet measurement community, and
      especially the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This memo also
      describes the combination of fundamental Active and Passive categories
      that are called Hybrid Methods and Metrics.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Purpose and Scope">
      <t>The scope of this memo is to define and describe Active and Passive
      versions of metrics and methods that are consistent with the long-time
      usage of these adjectives in the Internet measurement community and
      especially the IETF. Since the science of measurement is expanding, we
      provide a category for combinations of the traditional extremes,
      treating Active and Passive as a continuum and designating combinations
      of their attributes as Hybrid Methods.</t>

      <t>Further, this memo's purpose includes describing multiple dimensions
      to evaluate new methods as they emerge.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terms and Definitions">
      <t>This section defines the key terms of the memo. Some definitions use
      the notion of "stream of interest", which is synonymous with "population
      of interest" defined in clause 6.1.1 of ITU-T Recommendation Y.1540
      <xref target="Y.1540"/>. These definitions will be useful for any work
      in progress, such as <xref target="PASSIVE"/> (with which there is
      already good consistency).</t>

      <section title="Performance Metric">
        <t>The standard definition of a quantity, produced in an assessment of
        performance and/or reliability of the network, which has an intended
        utility and is carefully specified to convey the exact meaning of a
        measured value. (This definition is consistent with that of
        Performance Metric in <xref target="RFC2330"/> and <xref
        target="RFC6390"/>).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Method of Measurement">
        <t>The procedure or set of operations having the object of determining
        a Measured Value or Measurement Result.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Observation Point">
        <t>See Section 2 of <xref target="RFC7011"/> for the definition of
        Observation Point (a location in the network where packets can be
        observed), and related definitions. The comparable term defined in
        IETF literature on Active measurement is "Measurement Point" (see
        Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC5835"/>). Both of these terms have
        come into use describing similar actions at the identified point in
        the network path.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Active Methods">
        <t>Active measurement methods have the following attributes:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Active methods generate packet streams. Commonly, the packet
            stream of interest is generated as the basis of measurement.
            Sometimes, the adjective "synthetic" is used to categorize Active
            measurement streams <xref target="Y.1731"/>. An accompanying
            packet stream or streams may be generated to increase overall
            traffic load, though the loading stream(s) may not be
            measured.</t>

            <t>The packets in the stream of interest have fields or field
            values (or are augmented or modified to include fields or field
            values) that are dedicated to measurement. Since measurement
            usually requires determining the corresponding packets at multiple
            measurement points, a sequence number is the most common
            information dedicated to measurement, and it is often combined
            with a timestamp.</t>

            <t>The Source and Destination of the packet stream of interest are
            usually known a priori.</t>

            <t>The characteristics of the packet stream of interest are known
            at the Source (at least), and may be communicated to the
            Destination as part of the method. Note that some packet
            characteristics will normally change during packet forwarding.
            Other changes along the path are possible, see <xref
            target="STDFORM"/>.</t>
          </list>When adding traffic to the network for measurement, Active
        Methods influence the quantities measured to some degree, and those
        performing tests should take steps to quantify the effect(s) and/or
        minimize such effects.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Active Metric">
        <t>An Active Metric incorporates one or more of the aspects of Active
        Methods in the metric definition.</t>

        <t>For example, IETF metrics for IP performance (developed according
        to the framework described in <xref target="RFC2330"/>) include the
        Source-packet stream characteristics as metric-input parameters, and
        also specify the packet characteristics (Type-P) and Source and
        Destination IP addresses (with their implications on both stream
        treatment and interfaces associated with measurement points).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Passive Methods">
        <t>Passive measurement methods are:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>based solely on observations of an undisturbed and unmodified
            packet stream of interest (in other words, the method of
            measurement MUST NOT add, change, or remove packets or fields or
            change field values anywhere along the path).</t>

            <t>dependent on the existence of one or more packet streams to
            supply the stream of interest.</t>

            <t>dependent on the presence of the packet stream of interest at
            one or more designated Observation Points.</t>
          </list>Some Passive Methods simply observe and collect information
        on all packets that pass Observation Point(s), while others filter the
        packets as a first step and only collect information on packets that
        match the filter criteria, and thereby narrow the stream of
        interest.</t>

        <t>It is common that Passive Methods are conducted at one or more
        Observation Points. Passive methods to assess Performance Metrics
        often require multiple Observation Points, e.g., to assess the latency
        of packet transfer across a network path between two Observation
        Points. In this case, the observed packets must include enough
        information to determine the corresponding packets at different
        Observation Points.</t>

        <t>Communication of the observations (in some form) to a collector is
        an essential aspect of Passive Methods. In some configurations, the
        traffic load generated when communicating (or exporting) the Passive
        Method results to a collector may itself influence the measured
        network's performance. However, the collection of results is not
        unique to Passive Methods, and the load from management and operations
        of measurement systems must always be considered for potential effects
        on the measured values.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Passive Metric">
        <t>Passive Metrics apply to observations of packet traffic (traffic
        flows in <xref target="RFC7011"/>).</t>

        <t>Passive performance metrics are assessed independently of the
        packets or traffic flows, and solely through observation. Some refer
        to such assessments as "out of band".</t>

        <t>One example of Passive performance metrics for IP packet transfer
        can be found in ITU-T Recommendation Y.1540 <xref target="Y.1540"/>,
        where the metrics are defined on the basis of reference events
        generated as packets pass reference points. The metrics are agnostic
        to the distinction between Active and Passive when the necessary
        packet correspondence can be derived from the observed stream of
        interest as required.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Hybrid Methods and Metrics">
        <t>Hybrid Methods are Methods of Measurement that use a combination of
        Active Methods and Passive Methods, to assess Active Metrics, Passive
        Metrics, or new metrics derived from the a priori knowledge and
        observations of the stream of interest. ITU-T Recommendation Y.1540
        <xref target="Y.1540"/> defines metrics that are also applicable to
        the hybrid categories, since packet correspondence at different
        observation/reference points could be derived from "fields or field
        values which are dedicated to measurement", but otherwise the methods
        are Passive.</t>

        <t>There are several types of Hybrid Methods, as categorized
        below.</t>

        <t>With respect to a *single* stream of interest, Hybrid Type I
        methods fit in the continuum as follows, in terms of what happens at
        the Source (or Observation Point nearby): <list style="symbols">
            <t>Generation of the stream of interest =&gt; Active</t>

            <t>Augmentation or modification of the stream of interest, or
            employment of methods that modify the treatment of the stream
            =&gt; Hybrid Type I</t>

            <t>Observation of a stream of interest =&gt; Passive</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>As an example, consider the case where the method generates traffic
        load stream(s), and observes an existing stream of interest according
        to the criteria for Passive Methods. Since loading streams are an
        aspect of Active Methods, the stream of interest is not "solely
        observed", and the measurements involve a single stream of interest
        whose treatment has been modified by the presence of the load.
        Therefore, this is a Hybrid Type I method.</t>

        <t>We define Hybrid Type II as follows: Methods that employ two or
        more different streams of interest with some degree of mutual
        coordination (e.g., one or more Active streams and one or more
        undisturbed and unmodified packet streams) to collect both Active and
        Passive Metrics and enable enhanced characterization from additional
        joint analysis. <xref target="HYBRID"/> presents a problem statement
        for Hybrid Type II Methods and metrics. Note that one or more Hybrid
        Type I streams could be substituted for the Active streams or
        undisturbed streams in the mutually coordinated set. It is the Type II
        Methods where unique Hybrid Metrics are anticipated to emerge.</t>

        <t>Methods based on a combination of a single (generated) Active
        stream and Passive observations applied to the stream of interest at
        intermediate Observation Points are also Hybrid Methods. However,
        <xref target="RFC5644"/> already defines these as Spatial Metrics and
        Methods. It is possible to replace the Active stream of <xref
        target="RFC5644"/> with a Hybrid Type I stream and measure Spatial
        Metrics (but this was unanticipated when <xref target="RFC5644"/> was
        developed).</t>

        <t>The table below illustrates the categorization of methods (where
        "Synthesis" refers to a combination of Active and Passive Method
        attributes).</t>

        <t>There may be circumstances where results measured with Hybrid
        Methods can be considered equivalent to those measured with Passive
        Methods. This notion references the possibility of a "class C" where
        packets of different Type-P are treated equally in network
        implementation, as described in Section 13 of <xref target="RFC2330"/>
        and using the terminology for paths from Section 5 of <xref
        target="RFC2330"/>:</t>

        <t>
          <list>
            <t>Hybrid Methods of measurement that augment or modify packets of
            a "class C" in a host should produce results equivalent to Passive
            Methods of Measurement when hosts accessing and links transporting
            these packets along the path (other than those performing
            augmentation/modification) treat packets from both categories of
            methods (with and without the augmentation/modification) as the
            same "class C". The Passive Methods of Measurement represent the
            Ground Truth when comparing results between Passive and Hybrid
            Methods, and this comparison should be conducted to confirm the
            "class C" treatment.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Discussion">
      <t>This section illustrates the definitions and presents some
      examples.</t>

      <section title="Graphical Representation">
        <t>If we compare the Active and Passive Methods, there are at least
        two dimensions on which methods can be evaluated. This evaluation
        space may be useful when a method is a combination of the two
        alternative methods.</t>

        <t>The two dimensions (initially chosen) are:<list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Y-Axis:">"Effect of the measured stream on network
            conditions". The degree to which the stream of interest biases
            overall network conditions experienced by that stream and other
            streams. This is a key dimension for Active measurement error
            analysis. (Comment: There is also the notion of time averages -- a
            measurement stream may have significant effect while it is
            present, but the stream is only generated 0.1% of the time. On the
            other hand, observations alone have no effect on network
            performance. To keep these dimensions simple, we consider the
            stream effect only when it is present, but note that reactive
            networks defined in <xref target="RFC7312"/> may exhibit bias for
            some time beyond the life of a stream.)</t>

            <t hangText="X-Axis:">"a priori Stream Knowledge". The degree to
            which stream characteristics are known a priori. There are
            methodological advantages of knowing the source stream
            characteristics, and having complete control of the stream
            characteristics. For example, knowing the number of packets in a
            stream allows more-efficient operation of the measurement
            receiver, and so is an asset for Active measurement methods.
            Passive methods (with no sample filter) have few clues available
            to anticipate what protocol the first packet observed will use or
            how many packets will comprise the flow; once the standard
            protocol of a flow is known, the possibilities narrow (for some
            compliant flows). Therefore, this is a key dimension for Passive
            measurement error analysis.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>There are a few examples we can plot on a two-dimensional space. We
        can anchor the dimensions with reference point descriptions.</t>

        <t>(In the graph above, "PDM" refers to <xref target="PDMOPTION"/>, an
        IPv6 Option Header for Performance and Diagnostic Measurements,
        described in <xref target="pdm"/>.)</t>

        <t>We recognize that method categorization could be based on
        additional dimensions, but this would require a different graphical
        approach.</t>

        <t>For example, "effect of stream of interest on network conditions"
        could easily be further qualified into:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>effect on the performance of the stream of interest itself: for
            example, choosing a packet marking or Differentiated Services Code
            Point (DSCP) resulting in domain treatment as a real-time stream
            (as opposed to default/best-effort marking).</t>

            <t>effect on unmeasured streams that share the path and/or
            bottlenecks: for example, an extremely sparse measured stream of
            minimal size packets typically has little effect on other flows
            (and itself), while a stream designed to characterize path
            capacity may affect all other flows passing through the capacity
            bottleneck (including itself).</t>

            <t>effect on network conditions resulting in network adaptation:
            for example, a network monitoring load and congestion conditions
            might change routing, placing some flows on alternate paths to
            mitigate the congestion.</t>
          </list>We have combined 1 and 2 on the Y-axis, as examination of
        examples indicates strong correlation of the effects in this pair, and
        network adaptation is not addressed.</t>

        <t>It is apparent that different methods of IP network measurement can
        produce different results, even when measuring the same path at the
        same time. The two dimensions of the graph help us to understand how
        the results might change with the method chosen. For example, an
        Active Method to assess throughput adds some amount of traffic to the
        network, which might result in lower throughput for all streams.
        However, a Passive Method to assess throughput can also err on the low
        side due to unknown limitations of the hosts providing traffic,
        competition for host resources, limitations of the network interface,
        or private sub-networks that are not an intentional part of the path,
        etc. Hybrid Methods could easily suffer from both forms of error.
        Another example of potential errors stems from the pitfalls of using
        an Active stream with known a bias, such as a periodic stream defined
        in <xref target="RFC3432"/>. The strength of modeling periodic streams
        (like Voice over IP (VoIP)) is a potential weakness when extending the
        measured results to other application whose streams are non-periodic.
        The solutions are to model the application streams more exactly with
        an Active Method or to accept the risks and potential errors with the
        Passive Method discussed above.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="pdm" title="Discussion of PDM">
        <t>In <xref target="PDMOPTION"/>, an IPv6 Option Header for
        Performance and Diagnostic Measurements (PDM) is described which, when
        added to the stream of interest at strategic interfaces, supports
        performance measurements. This method processes a user traffic stream
        and adds "fields which are dedicated to measurement" (the measurement
        intent is made clear in the title of this option). Thus:</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Brief Discussion of OAM Methods">
        <t>Many Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM) methods exist
        beyond the IP layer. For example, <xref target="Y.1731"/> defines
        several different measurement methods that we would classify as
        follows:<list style="symbols">
            <t>Loss Measurement (LM) occasionally injects frames with a count
            of previous frames since the last LM message. We conclude LM is
            Hybrid Type I, because this method processes a user traffic stream
            and augments the stream of interest with frames having "fields
            which are dedicated to measurement".</t>

            <t>Synthetic Loss Measurement (SLM) and Delay Measurement (DM)
            methods both inject dedicated measurement frames, so the "stream
            of interest is generated as the basis of measurement". We conclude
            that SLM and DM methods are Active Methods.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>We also recognize the existence of alternate terminology used in
        OAM at layers other than IP. Readers are encouraged to consult <xref
        target="RFC6374"/> for MPLS Loss and Delay measurement terminology,
        for example.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>When considering the security and privacy of those involved in
      measurement or those whose traffic is measured, there is sensitive
      information communicated and observed at observation and measurement
      points described above, and protocol issues to consider. We refer the
      reader to the security and privacy considerations described in the Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) Framework <xref
      target="RFC7594"/>, which covers Active and Passive measurement
      techniques and supporting material on measurement context.</t>

      <t>Thanks to Mike Ackermann for asking the right question, and for
      several suggestions on terminology. Brian Trammell provided key terms
      and references for the Passive category, and suggested ways to expand
      the Hybrid description and types. Phil Eardley suggested some hybrid
      scenarios for categorization as part of his review. Tiziano Ionta
      reviewed the document and suggested the classification for the
      "coloring" Method of Measurement. Nalini Elkins identified several areas
      for clarification following her review. Bill Jouris, Stenio Fernandes,
      and Spencer Dawkins suggested several editorial improvements. Tal
      Mizrahi, Joachim Fabini, Greg Mirsky, and Mike Ackermann raised many key
      considerations in their Working Group Last Call (WGLC) reviews, based on
      their broad measurement experience.</t>
