	<abstract><t>
   In Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) active-active access, a Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) check
   failure issue may occur when using the pseudo-nickname mechanism
   specified in RFC 7781. This document describes a solution to resolve
   this RPF check failure issue through centralized replication. All
   ingress Routing Bridges (RBridges) send Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, and Multicast (BUM)
   traffic to a centralized node with unicast TRILL encapsulation.
   When the centralized node receives the BUM traffic, it decapsulates
   the packets and forwards them to their destination RBridges using
   a distribution tree established per the TRILL base protocol (RFC 6325).
   To avoid RPF check failure on an RBridge sitting between the ingress
   RBridge and the centralized replication node, some change in the
   RPF calculation algorithm is required. RPF checks on each RBridge
   MUST be calculated as if the centralized node was the ingress
   RBridge, instead of being calculated using the actual ingress
   RBridge. This document updates RFC 6325.</t>

	<section title="Introduction" anchor="section-1"><t> The IETF
	TRILL protocol <xref target="RFC6325"/> provides multipath
	data forwarding that is loop free and per-hop based with
	minimum configuration. TRILL uses IS-IS <xref
	target="RFC6165"/> <xref target="RFC7176"/> as its control
	plane routing protocol and defines a TRILL-specific header for
	user data.</t>

	<t>


   Customer Equipment (CE) devices can be multihomed to a set of edge
   RBridges forming an edge group where active-active service can be
   provided. In that case, all of the uplinks from a CE are handled via
   a Local Active-Active Link Protocol (LAALP) <xref target="RFC7379"/> such as Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation (MC-LAG) or Distributed Resilient Network
   Interconnect (DRNI) <xref target="IEEE802.1AX"/>. An active-active flow-based load-sharing mechanism  can achieve better load-balancing and high
   reliability. A CE device can be a Layer 3 (L3) end system by itself or a
   bridge switch through which L3 end systems access the TRILL
   campus.</t>

	<t>
   In active-active access, the pseudo-nickname solution in <xref target="RFC7781"/>
   can be used to avoid Media Access Control (MAC) flip-flop on remote RBridges. The basic
   idea is to use a virtual RBridge (RBv) with a single pseudo-nickname
   to represent an edge group. Any member RBridge of that edge group
   uses this pseudo-nickname rather than its own nickname as the
   ingress nickname when it injects TRILL data frames to the TRILL campus.
   The use of the nickname solves the address flip-flop issue by
   setting the nickname learned by a remote RBridge to be the 
   pseudo-nickname. However, it introduces another issue of incorrect packet
   dropping as follows: When a pseudo-nickname is used by an edge
   RBridge as the ingress nickname to forward BUM traffic, any RBridges (RBn) sitting between
   the ingress RBridge and the distribution tree root will treat the
   traffic as if it were ingressed from the RBv. If the
   same distribution tree is used by different edge RBridges of the
   same RBv, the traffic may arrive at some RBn from different ports.
   Then, the Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) check required by TRILL
   <xref target="RFC6325"/> fails, and the BUM traffic received on unexpected ports
   will be dropped by RBn.</t>

	<t>
   This document specifies a centralized replication solution for
   BUM traffic forwarding to
   resolve the issue of incorrect packet drop caused by the RPF check
   failure in the virtual RBridge case. The basic idea is that all
   ingress RBridges send BUM traffic to a centralized node, which
   MUST be a distribution tree root, using unicast TRILL
   encapsulation. When the centralized node receives the packets, it
   decapsulates and forwards them to their destination RBridges using a
   distribution tree established as per the TRILL base protocol. This
   document updates <xref target="RFC6325"/>; per <xref target="RFC6325"/>, multi-destination
   traffic is ingressed to a multi-destination TRILL data packet. However, per this document, when using the centralized replication
   feature, multi-destination traffic is initially ingressed to a
   unicast TRILL data packet.</t>

	<section title="Centralized Replication Solution Overview" anchor="section-3"><t>
   When an edge RBridge receives BUM traffic from a CE device, it uses
   unicast TRILL encapsulation instead of multicast encapsulation to
   send the packets to a centralized node. The centralized node MUST be
   a distribution tree root. Distribution tree roots are normally
   chosen to be high-capacity core RBridges with many high-bandwidth
   adjacencies. This constraint makes it practical, as described
   below, to support centralized replication with only software changes
   to transit RBridges.</t>

	<t>
   The TRILL header of the unicast TRILL encapsulation contains an
   "ingress RBridge nickname" field and an "egress RBridge nickname"
   field <xref target="RFC6325"/>. If the ingress RBridge receives the
   BUM packet from a port that is in an active-active edge group using
   <xref target="RFC7781"/>, it sets the ingress RBridge nickname to
   be the pseudo-nickname rather than its own nickname to avoid MAC
   flip-flop (see Section 3.3 of <xref target="RFC7379"/>) on remote
   RBridges. The egress RBridge nickname is set to a special nickname
   of the centralized node that is used to differentiate the
   centralized replication purpose unicast TRILL encapsulation from a
   normal unicast TRILL encapsulation. This special nickname is called
   an "R-nickname".</t>

	<t>
   When the centralized RBridge receives a unicast TRILL-encapsulated
   packet with its R-nickname as the egress nickname, it decapsulates the
   packet. Then, the centralized RBridge replicates and forwards the
   BUM packet to the packet's destination RBridges using one of the
   distribution trees established per the TRILL base protocol <xref target="RFC6325"/>. It MUST
   use a distribution tree whose tree root is the centralized RBridge
   itself. (An RBridge may be the root of more than one tree.) When the
   centralized RBridge forwards the BUM traffic, it simply sends it on
   the distribution tree as if it were a locally ingressed frame, except
   that the ingress nickname remains the same as that in the packet it
   received to ensure that the MAC address learning by all egress
   RBridges is bound to the pseudo-nickname.</t>

	<t>
   When the replicated packet is forwarded by each RBridge along the
   distribution tree starting from the centralized node, an RPF check
   is performed per <xref target="RFC6325"/>. For any RBridge sitting between the
   ingress RBridge and the centralized replication node, the incoming
   port of such a BUM packet should be the centralized-node-facing port,
   as the multicast traffic always comes from the centralized node in
   this solution. However, the RPF port as the result of distribution
   tree calculation as specified in <xref target="RFC6325"/> will be the real ingress
   RBridge-facing port, as it uses the edge group's virtual RBridge as
   the ingress RBridge, so the RPF check will fail.</t>

	<t>
	  To solve this problem, some change in the RPF test is required.
	  In
   this case, the RPF calculation on each RBridge should use the
   centralized node as the ingress RBridge for each tree for which that
   node is the root instead of the real ingress virtual RBridge to
   perform the calculation. As a result, the RPF check will accept traffic
   on the centralized-node-facing port of the RBridge for multi-destination traffic. This prevents incorrect frame drops by the RPF
   check.</t>

	<t>
   The change in the actual RPF check on a received multi-destination
   TRILL data packet is easy. The RPF check from <xref
   target="RFC6325"/> is a check to see if a triple of {ingress
   nickname, tree, receiving RBridge port} is allowed. (The tree is
   indicated by the nickname of its root, which is stored in the TRILL
   Header "egress nickname" field.)

   When determining the RPF check,
   if "ingress nickname" is using centralized replication (indicated
   by a C-nickname, see <xref target="section-9"/>), then the check is
   based on distribution from the tree root. If "ingress nickname" is
   not using centralized replication, then the check is based on
   distribution from the RBridge having the ingress nickname.</t>

	<t>
   To differentiate the centralized replication unicast TRILL
   encapsulation from normal unicast TRILL encapsulation, the
   R-nickname is introduced for centralized replication. When the
   centralized node receives unicast TRILL encapsulation traffic with
   the egress nickname R-nickname, it decapsulates the packet and then
   forwards the packet to the destination RBridges through a
   distribution tree for which it is the root by re-encapsulation as
   aforementioned. In TRILL, RBridges can hold multiple nicknames, so
   the centralized RBridge simply obtains another nickname to use as
   the R-nickname. The centralized RBridge or RBridges should announce
   their R-nickname to all TRILL campuses through the TRILL Link State PDU (LSP)
   extension specified in <xref target="section-11"/>.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Frame Duplication from Remote RBridge"
	anchor="section-4"><t> Frame duplication may occur when a
	remote host sends a multi-destination frame to a local CE
	that has an active-active connection to the TRILL campus. To
	avoid the local CE receiving multiple copies from a remote
	RBridge, the Designated Forwarder (DF) mechanism is supported
	for egress-direction multicast traffic.</t>

	<t>
   The DF election mechanism <xref target="RFC7781"/> allows only one
   port of one RBridge in an active-active group to forward multicast
   traffic from the TRILL campus to the local access side for each
   VLAN. The basic idea of using DF is to elect one RBridge per VLAN from an
   edge group to be responsible for egressing the BUM traffic. <xref
   target="RFC7781"/> describes the DF election mechanism among member
   RBridges involved in an edge group.</t>

	<t>
   If the DF election mechanism is used for frame-duplication
   prevention, access ports on an RBridge are categorized as one of
   three types: non-group, group DF port, and group non-DF port. The
   last two types can be called group ports. Each of the group ports
   is associated with a pseudo-nickname. If consistent nickname
   allocation to edge group RBridges is used, it is possible that the same
   pseudo-nickname is associated with more than one port on a single
   RBridge. A typical scenario is that CE1 is connected to RB1 and RB2
   by LAALP1, whereas CE2 is connected to RB1 and RB2 by LAALP2.
   In order to conserve the number of pseudo-nicknames used, member
   ports for both LAALP1 and LAALP2 on RB1 and RB2 are all associated
   with the same pseudo-nickname.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Local Forwarding Behavior on Ingress RBridge" anchor="section-5"><t>
   When an ingress RBridge (RB1) receives BUM traffic from a local
   active-active connected CE (CE1) device, the traffic will be
   injected into the TRILL campus with TRILL encapsulation; it will
   be replicated and forwarded to all destination RBridges through
   central replication, including the ingress RBridge itself, along a
   TRILL distribution tree. To avoid the traffic looping back to the
   original sender CE, an ingress nickname of the CE group's pseudo-nickname is used for traffic filtering.</t>

	<t>
   However, if there are two CEs, say CE1 and CE2, connecting to the
   ingress RB1 and each associated with the same pseudo-nickname, RB1
   needs to locally replicate and forward to CE2, because another copy
   of the BUM traffic between CE1 and CE2 through the TRILL campus will be
   blocked by the traffic filtering.</t>

	<t>
   If CE1 and CE2 are not associated with the same pseudo-nickname, the
   copy of the BUM traffic between CE1 and CE2 through the TRILL campus
   won't be blocked by the traffic filtering. To avoid duplicated
   traffic on receiver CE, there cannot be local replicated BUM traffic
   between these two CEs on ingress RB1.</t>

	<t>
   In summary, to ensure correct BUM traffic forwarding behavior for
   each CE, the local replication behavior on the ingress RBridge is as
   follows:</t>

	<t><list style="numbers"><t>Replicate to the active-active group ports associated with the
         same pseudo-nickname as that associated with the incoming port.</t>

	<t>Do not replicate to active-active group ports associated with
         other pseudo-nicknames.</t>

	<t>Do not replicate to non-edge-group ports.</t>

	</list>
	</t>


	<t>
   The above local forwarding behavior on the ingress RBridge of RB1
   can be called "centralized replication local forwarding behavior A".</t>

	<t>
   If ingress RBridge RB1 itself is the centralized replication node,
   BUM traffic injected by RB1 into the TRILL campus won't loop back to
   RB1. In this case, the local forwarding behavior is called
   centralized replication local forwarding behavior B. Behavior B on
   RB1 is as follows:</t>

	<t><list style="numbers"><t>Local replication to the ports associated with the same
         pseudo-nickname as that associated with the incoming port.</t>

	<t>Local replication to the group DF port associated with
         different pseudo-nicknames. Do not replicate to group non-DF ports
         associated with different pseudo-nicknames.</t>

	<t>Local replication to non-edge-group ports.</t>

	</list>
	</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Loop Prevention among RBridges in an Edge Group" anchor="section-6"><t>
	  
   If a CE sends a BUM packet through a DF port to an ingress RBridge,
   that RBridge will forward that packet to all or a subset of the
   other RBridges that only have non-DF ports for that active-active
   group. Because BUM traffic forwarding to non-DF ports isn't
   allowed, in this case, the frame won't loop back to the CE.</t>

	<t>
   If a CE sends a BUM packet through a non-DF port to an ingress
   RBridge, say RB1, then RB1 will forward that packet to other
   RBridges that have a DF port for that active-active group. In this
   case, the frame will loop back to the CE and the traffic split-horizon filtering mechanism is used to avoid looping back among
   RBridges in the edge group.</t>

	<t>
   This split-horizon mechanism relies on the ingress nickname field in
   the TRILL header to check if a packet's egress port belongs to the
   same active-active group as the packet's incoming port to the TRILL
   campus.</t>

	<t>
   When the ingress RBridge receives BUM traffic from an active-active
   connected CE device, the traffic will be sent through the TRILL
   campus with TRILL encapsulation to a centralized RBridge. There it
   will be replicated and forwarded to its destination RBridges, which
   include the ingress RBridge itself, through a TRILL distribution tree.
   If the same pseudo-nickname is used for two active-active access CEs
   as the ingress nickname, an egress RBridge can use that nickname to
   filter traffic forwarding to all local CEs. In this case, the
   traffic between these two CEs goes through the local RBridge and
   another copy of the traffic from the TRILL campus is filtered. If
   different ingress nicknames are used for two connecting CE devices,
   the access ports connecting to these two CEs should be isolated from
   each other. The BUM traffic between these two CEs should go through
   the TRILL campus; otherwise, the destination CE connected to same
   RBridge with the sender CE will receive two copies of the traffic.</t>

   Note: The asterisk line, hyphen &amp; vertical bar line, and circumflex
   line in this figure indicate the connection of the various CEs to
   the various RBs.</t>

	<t>
   Assuming the centralized replication solution is used in the
   example network of above <xref target="active-access"/>: RB5 is the
   distribution tree root and centralized replication node; CE1 and
   CE2 are active-active accessed to RB1, RB2, and RB3 through LAALP1
   and LAALP2, respectively; and CE3 is single-homed to RB3. The RBridge's
   own nicknames of RB1 to RB5 are nick1 to nick5, respectively. RB1,
   RB2, and RB3 use the same pseudo-nickname for LAALP1 and LAALP2;
   that pseudo-nickname is P-nick. The R-nickname on the centralized
   replication node of RB5 is S-nick.</t>

	<t>
   The BUM traffic forwarding process from CE1 to CE2 and CE3 is as
   follows:</t>

	<t><list style="numbers"><t>CE1 sends BUM traffic to RB3.</t>

	<t>RB3 replicates and sends the BUM traffic to CE2 locally. RB2
          also sends the traffic to RB5 using unicast TRILL encapsulation. In
          the TRILL Header, the ingress nickname is set as P-nick and the
          egress nickname is set as S-nick.</t>

	<t>RB5 decapsulates the unicast TRILL data packet. Then, it
	uses a distribution tree for which it is the root to forward
	the packet as a multi-destination TRILL data packet. The
	egress nickname in the multi-destination TRILL Header is the
	nick5 and the ingress nickname is still P-nick. If RB3 had
	sent the unicast to some nickname that was not an R-nickname,
	the packet would not be re-encapsulated. If it is sent to an
	R-nickname that is not a tree root, it either will not be
	forwarded at all or, if it is re-encapsulated and forwarded,
	will be subject to incorrect pruning and will not be delivered
	to all of its intended recipients.</t>
<t>RB4 receives multicast TRILL traffic from RB5. The incoming traffic
         port is the up port facing the distribution tree root.
         RB4's RPF check will be correct based on the changed RPF port
         calculation algorithm in this document. After the RPF check is
         performed, it forwards the traffic to all other egress RBridges (RB1,
         RB2, and RB3).</t>

	<t>RB3 receives multicast TRILL traffic from RB4. It decapsulates
         the multi-destination TRILL data packet. Because the ingress
         nickname of P-nick is equivalent to the nickname of local LAALPs
         connecting to CE1 and CE2, RB3 doesn't forward the traffic to CE1
         and CE2 to avoid a duplicated frame. RB3 only forwards the packet to
         CE3.</t>

	<t>RB1 and RB2 receive multicast TRILL traffic from RB4. The
         forwarding process is similar to the process on RB3, i.e., because
         the ingress nickname of P-nick is equivalent to the nickname of the
         local LAALPs connecting CE1 and CE2, they also don't forward the
         traffic to local CE1 and CE2.</t>

   To support unicast TRILL encapsulation BUM traffic load-balancing,
   multiple centralized replication nodes can be deployed and the
   traffic can be spread over these nodes based on data label (VLAN or
   FGL). Furthermore, if it was desirable for a centralized node to be
   sent more of this BUM traffic, it could hold two or more R-nicknames.
   The share of BUM traffic it would receive would be proportional to
   the number of R-nicknames it held.</t>

	<t>
   Assuming there are k different R-nicknames held by centralized
   nodes in a TRILL campus, the VLAN-based (or FGL-based <xref
   target="RFC7172"/>) load-balancing algorithm used by an ingress
   active-active access RBridge is as follows:</t>

	<t><list style="numbers"><t>All R-nicknames are ordered and numbered from 0 to k-1 in
            ascending order, treating the nicknames as unsigned 16-bit
	    integers.</t>
<t>For data label ID m, choose the R-nickname whose index is
	given by (m mod k) as egress nickname for BUM traffic unicast TRILL
        encapsulation.
	</t>

	</list>
	</t>

	<t>
   For example, there are three R-Nicknames (RNs). The RNs will be ordered
   RN0 to RN2. Assuming there are five VLANs from VLAN ID1 to ID5
   spreading among edge RBridges, the traffic in VLAN1 will go to RN1,
   VLAN2 will go to RN2, and so on.</t>

	<t>
   When an ingress RBridge participating in an active-active
   connection receives BUM traffic from a local CE, the RBridge
   decides which R-nickname to send the traffic to based on the
   VLAN-based load-spreading algorithm; thus, data-label-based
   load-balancing for the BUM traffic can be achieved using multiple
   centralized nodes/multiple R-nicknames.</t>

<t>
Both the centralized replication solution and the Coordinated
Multicast Trees (CMT) solution from <xref target="RFC7783"/> rely on using
pseudo-nicknames to avoid MAC flip-flop on remote RBridges.
These two solutions can coexist in a single TRILL campus.
Each solution can be selected by each active-active edge
group of RBridges independently.</t>

	<t>
   As illustrated in <xref target="ref-cmt-and-centralized-replication-co-existing-scenario"/>, RB1 and RB2 use CMT for CE1's active-active access; RB3, RB4, and RB5 use the centralized replication for
   CE2's active-active access.</t>

	<t>
   For the centralized replication solution, edge group RBridges MUST
   announce the local pseudo-nickname using the Nickname Flags APPsub-TLV
   with C flag set. A nickname with the C flag set is called a "C-nickname". A transit RBridge will perform the centralized replication-specific RPF check algorithm if it receives TRILL data
   packets with a C-nickname as the ingress nickname.</t>

	<t>
   An edge group using CMT <xref target="RFC7783"/> MUST NOT set the
   C flag on the pseudo-nickname it is using.  This is already
   mandatory behavior because any RBridge originating a Nickname Flags
   APPsub-TLV is required by <xref target="RFC7780"/> to set any flag
   bit it does not know about to zero. If an edge RBridge using CMT
   <xref target="RFC7783"/> nevertheless set the C-bit for an edge
   group pseudo-nickname, it is very likely that BUM traffic
   encapsulated with that nickname as ingress would be incorrectly
   pruned early in its distribution and would, thus, reach few (possibly
   none) of its intended targets. To avoid confusion, a
   pseudo-nickname MUST NOT be shared between a centralized
   replication edge group and a CMT-based edge group.</t>

	<section title="Network Upgrade Analysis" anchor="section-10"><t>
   Centralized nodes will typically need software and hardware upgrades
   to support centralized replication, which stitches together the
   TRILL unicast traffic decapsulation process and the process of
   normal TRILL multicast traffic forwarding along the distribution tree.</t>

	<t>
   Active-active connection edge RBridges will typically need software
   and hardware upgrades to support unicast TRILL encapsulation for BUM
   traffic; the process is similar to other head-end replication
   processes.</t>

	<t>
   Transit nodes typically need only a software upgrade to support the
   changed RPF port calculation algorithm.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="TRILL Protocol Extensions"
	anchor="section-11"><t> Two new flags, "R" and "C", are
	specified in the Nickname Flags APPsub-TLV <xref
	target="RFC7780"/>. A nickname with the R flag set is called
	an "R-nickname" and a nickname with the C flag set is
	called a "C-nickname". The R-nickname is a specialized nickname
	attached to a centralized node to differentiate unicast TRILL-encapsulated BUM traffic from normal unicast TRILL
	traffic. The C-nickname flag is set on the pseudo-nickname for
	each edge group that uses the centralized replication. A
	C-nickname is a specialized pseudo-nickname for which transit
	RBridges perform a different RPF check algorithm for TRILL
	data packets with the C-nickname in the ingress nickname
	field.</t>

	<t>
   When active-active edge RBridges use centralized replication to
   forward BUM traffic, the R-nickname is used as the egress nickname
   and the C-nickname is used as ingress nickname in the TRILL header
   for the unicast TRILL encapsulation of BUM traffic.</t>

	<section title="&quot;R&quot; and &quot;C&quot; Flag in the Nickname Flags APPsub-TLV" anchor="section-11.1"><t>
   If this APPsub-TLV is being advertised by an RBridge that does not
   have the nickname appearing in the Nickname Flags APPsub-TLV, the R
   and C flag bits in the APPsub-TLV MUST be treated as if they were
   zero. If an RBridge that is not a distribution tree root advertises
   an R-nickname, that nickname MUST NOT be treated as an R-nickname
   but rather as an ordinary nickname; that is, the R-nickname flag is
   ignored for all purposes if the nickname is held by an RBridge that
   is not a tree root.</t>

        <t>R = If the R flag is one, it indicates that the advertising

        edge group RBridges use this centralized replication solution
        for active-active access. If the R flag is zero, that nickname will
        not be used for that purpose.</t>

   Due to errors or due to transient inconsistent LSPs
   when the link state database is converging after a configuration
   change or the like, it is possible for there to be inconsistent Nickname Flags
   APPsub-TLVs for the same nickname. In this case, it is RECOMMENDED
   that the nickname be treated as if the R / C flag were set if any
   Nickname Flags APPsub-TLV for that nickname has the R / C flag set.</t>

	<section title="Security Considerations"
	anchor="section-12"><t> This document does not introduce any
	extra security risks. A rogue RBridge that is a tree root can
	attract traffic by advertising an R-nickname. However, this
	does not represent a substantial increase in risk as RBridges
	could cause problems in a number of other ways by advertising
	low-cost adjacencies or making themselves the highest priority
	tree root or the like. In general, the protection against an
	untrusted device acting as an RBridge and wrecking havoc is to
	use IS-IS authentication <xref target="RFC5310"/> and
	configure and administer the TRILL campus so that only trusted
	RBridges have the authentication key.</t>
