<abstract>

<t>
   
When a private network or internetwork grows very large, it is sometimes
not possible to address all interfaces using private IPv4 address space
because there are not enough addresses. This document describes the problems 
faced by those networks, the available options, and the issues involved in 
assigning a new block of private IPv4 address space.

</t>

<t>

While this informational document does not make a recommendation for action, it 
documents the issues surrounding the various options that have been considered.
 
</t>
   
</abstract>

</front>

<middle>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>
      
<xref target="RFC1918"/> sets aside three blocks of IPv4 address space for
use in private networks: 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12 and 10.0.0.0/8. These
blocks can be used simultaneously in multiple, separately managed networks without
registration or coordination with IANA or any Internet registry. Very large 
networks can find that they need to number more device interfaces than there
are available addresses in these three ranges.

It has occasionally been suggested that additional private IPv4 address space
should be reserved for use by these networks. Although such an action might address 
some of the needs for these very large network operators, it is not without
consequences, particularly as we near the date when the IANA free pool
will be fully allocated.
</t>

<t>
The overall conclusion is that allocating additional address space to be used
as private address space has severe problems and would, for instance, impact any
software or configuration that has built-in assumptions about private address
space. However, it is also well understood that cascading Network Address
Translation (NAT) deployments in
the existing private address space will cause different types of severe
problems when address spaces overlap. At this point, there is no clear agreement
of the likelihood of various problems or the respective trade-offs.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Large Networks">

<t>
      
The main categories of very large networks using private address space are:  
cable operators, wireless (cell phone) operators, private internets, and VPN 
service providers. In the case of the first two categories, the complete
address space reserved in <xref target="RFC1918"/> tends to be used by a single 
organization. In the case of private internets and VPN service providers, there 
are multiple independently managed and operated networks and the difficulty is 
in avoiding address clashes.
      
</t>
   
</section>

<section title="Non-Unique Addresses">

<section title="Subscriber Use Network Address Translation">

<t> 
   
The address space set aside in <xref target="RFC1918"/> is a finite resource that 
can be used to provide limited Internet access via NAT. A discussion of the advantages and disadvantages 
of NATs is outside the scope of this document, but an analysis of the 
advantages, disadvantages, and architectural implications can be found in 
<xref target="RFC2993"></xref>. Nonetheless, it must 
be acknowledged that NAT is adequate in some situations and not in 
others. For instance, it might technically be feasible to use NAT 
or even multiple layers of NAT within the networks operated by 
residential users or corporations where only limited Internet access is
required. A more detailed analysis can be found in <xref target="RFC3022"></xref>. 
Where true peer-to-peer communication is needed or where 
services or applications do not work properly behind NAT, globally 
unique address space is required. In other cases, NAT traversal techniques 
facilitate peer-to-peer like communication for devices behind NATs.

</t>
   
<t>
   
In many cases, it is possible to use multiple layers of NAT to re-use
parts of the address space defined in <xref target="RFC1918"/>. It
is not always possible to rely on Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) devices
using any particular range, however. 
In some cases, this means that unorthodox workarounds 
including assigning CPE devices unallocated address space or address 
space allocated to other network operators are feasible. In other 
cases, organizations choose to operate multiple separate routing 
domains to allow them to re-use the same private address ranges in 
multiple contexts. One consequence of this is the added complexity 
involved in identifying which system is referred to when an IP address 
is identified in a log or management system.
   
</t>   

</section>
   
<section title="Carrier-Grade Network Address Translation"></section>   
   
<t>
   
Another option is to share one address across multiple interfaces and
in some cases, subscribers. This model breaks the classical model used
for logging address assignments and creates significant risks and 
additional burdens, as described in <xref target="CLAYTON"/> and more 
fully discussed in <xref target="FORD"/>, and as documented in <xref target="DS-LITE"></xref>.
   
</t>
   
</section>

<section title="Available Options">

<t>
   
When a network operator has exhausted the private address space set 
aside in <xref target="RFC1918"/> but needs to continue operating a 
single routing domain, a number of options are available. These are described
in the following sections.

</t>

<section title="IPv6 Options">
<section title="Unique Globally Scoped IPv6 Unicast Addresses">
      
<t>

Using unique, globally scoped IPv6 unicast addresses is the best 
permanent solution as it removes any concerns about address scarcity 
within the next few decades. Implementing IPv6 is a major endeavor 
for service providers with millions of consumers and is likely 
to take considerable effort and time. In some cases, implementing a 
new network protocol on a very large network takes more time than is 
available, based on network growth and the proportion of private space 
that has already been used. In these cases, there is a call for additional
private address space that can be shared by all network operators. 
<xref target="DAVIES"/> makes one such case.

</t>

</section>

<section title="Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses">

   <t>
Using the unique, local IPv6 unicast addresses defined in <xref target="RFC4193"/>
is another approach and does not require coordination with an Internet
registry. Although the addresses defined in <xref target="RFC4193"/> are probabilistically
unique, network operators on private internets and those providing VPN 
services might not want to use them because there is a very low 
probability of non-unique locally assigned global IDs being generated 
by the algorithm. Also, in the case of private internets, it can be very
challenging to coordinate the introduction of a new network protocol to support
the internet's continued growth. 
   </t>

</section>
</section>

<section title="IPv4 Options">
<section title="Address Transfers or Leases from Organizations with Available Address Space">
      
<t>

The Regional Internet Registry (RIR) communities have recently been developing
policies to allow organizations with available address space to transfer 
such designated space to other organizations <xref target="RIR-POLICY"/>.  In other cases,
leases might be arranged.  This approach is only viable for operators
of very large networks if enough address space is made available for
transfer or lease and if the very large networks are able to pay the costs of
these transfers.  It is not possible to know how much address space
will become available in this way, when it will be available, and how
much it will cost.  However, it is unlikely to become available in large 
contiguous blocks, and this would add to the network management burden 
for the operator as a significant number of small prefixes would inflate 
the size of the operators routing table at a time when it is also adding 
an IPv6 routing table. These reasons will make address transfers a less
attractive proposition to many large network operators. Leases 
might not be attractive to some organizations if both parties 
cannot agree to a suitable length of time. Also, the lessor might worry
about its own unanticipated needs for additional IPv4 address space.

</t>
      
</section>
   
<section title="Using Unannounced Address Space Allocated to Another
  Organization" anchor="Unnannounced_Address_Space">
      
   <t>
         
Some network operators have considered using IP address space that
is allocated to another organization but is not publicly visible in
BGP routing tables.  This option is very strongly discouraged as the
fact that an address block is not visible from one view does not mean
that it is not visible from another. Furthermore, address usage tends 
to leak beyond private network borders in e-mail headers, DNS queries,
traceroute output and other ways. The ambiguity this causes is 
problematic for multiple organizations. This issue is discussed in 
 <xref target="RFC3879"/>, Section 2.3. 
         
   </t>
 
<t>

It is also possible that the registrant of the address block might want 
to increase its visibility to other networks in the future, causing 
problems for anyone using it unofficially.  In some cases, there might 
also be legal risks involved in using address space officially allocated 
to another organization.
   
</t>
 
 <t>
 
Where this has happened in the past, it has caused operational
problems <xref target="FASTWEB"/>.
    
 </t>
 
</section>

<section title="Unique IPv4 Space Registered by an RIR">
      
<t>
      
RIRs' policies allow network operators to receive unique IP addresses 
for use on internal networks. Further, network operators are not required 
to have already exhausted the private address space set aside in 
<xref target="RFC1918"/>. Nonetheless, network operators are naturally 
disinclined to request unique IPv4 addresses for the private areas of 
their networks, as using addresses in this way means they are not available 
for use by new Internet user connections.
      
</t>
   
<t>

It is likely to become more difficult for network operators to obtain
large blocks of unique address space as we approach the point where all
IPv4 unicast /8s have been allocated. Several RIRs already have policies
about how to allocate from their last /8 <xref target="RIR-POLICY-FINAL-8"/>,
and there have been policy discussions that would reduce the maximum
allocation size available to network operators <xref target="MAX-ALLOC"/>
or would reduce the period of need for which the RIR can allocate 
<xref target="SHORTER-PERIODS"/>.

</t>   

</section>
</section>
</section>


<section title="Options and Consequences for Defining New Private Use Space">

<section title="Redefining Existing Unicast Space as Private Address Space">

<t>

It is possible to re-designate a portion of the current global 
unicast IPv4 address space as private unicast address space. Doing 
this could benefit a number of operators of large networks for the 
short period before they complete their IPv6 roll-out. However, this
benefit incurs a cost by reducing the pool of global unicast 
addresses available to users in general.

</t>

<t>

When discussing re-designating a portion of the current global 
unicast IPv4 address space as private unicast address space, it is
important to consider how much space would be used and for how
long it would be sufficient. Not all of the large networks making
full use of the space defined in <xref target="RFC1918"/> would have their needs
met with a single /8. In 2005, <xref target="HAIN"/> suggested 
reserving three /8s for this purpose, while in 2009 <xref target="DAVIES"/> 
suggested a single /10 would be sufficient. There does not seem to be a 
consensus for a particular prefix length nor an agreed basis for 
deciding what is sufficient. The problem is exacerbated by the 
continually changing needs of ever expanding networks.
   
</t>

<t>
   
A further consideration is which of the currently unallocated
IPv4 unicast /8 blocks should be used for this purpose. Using
address space that is known to be used unofficially is tempting.
For instance, 1.0.0.0/8, which was unallocated until January 2010, was 
proposed in <xref target="HAIN"/> and is known to be used by a 
number of different users. These include networks making use of HIP LSIs 
<xref target="RFC4423"/>, <xref target="WIANA"/>, <xref target="anoNet"/>, and others. 
There is anecdotal <xref target="VEGODA"/> and research <xref target="WESSELS"/> evidence 
to suggest that several other IPv4 /8s are used in this fashion. Also there 
have been discussions <xref target="NANOG"/> about some sections of these /8's being 
carved out and filtered, therefore unofficially enabling the use of these
sections for private use.
   
</t>

<t>
      
Although new IPv4 /8s are allocated approximately once a month, they are not easy
to bring into use because network operators are slow to change their filter
configurations. This is despite long-running awareness campaigns <xref target="CYMRU"/> <xref target="LEWIS"/> 
and active work <xref target="ripe-351"/> to notify people whose filters are not
changed in a timely fashion. Updating code that recognizes private address space 
in deployed software and infrastructure systems is likely to be far more difficult 
as many systems have these ranges hard-coded and cannot be quickly changed with a
new configuration file.
      
</t>

<t>

Another consideration when redefining existing unicast space as private address space
is that no single class of user can expect the space to stay unique to them. This means 
that an ISP using a new private address range cannot expect its customers not to
already be using that address range within their own networks. 
   
</t>

</section>
      
<section title="Unique IPv4 Space Shared by a Group of Operators">
      
      <t>
         
         Where a group of networks find themselves in a position where they each
         need a large amount of IPv4 address space from an RIR in addition to that 
         defined in <xref target="RFC1918"/>, they might cooperatively agree 
         to all use the same address space to number their networks. The
         clear benefit to this approach is that it significantly reduces the 
         potential demand on the pool of unallocated IPv4 address space. However,
         the issues discussed in Sections <xref target="Unnannounced_Address_Space" format="counter" />
and <xref target="Unicast_Space" format="counter" />
 are of concern here, particularly
         the possibility that one operator might decide to use the address space
         to number customer connections, rather than private infrastructure.
         
      </t>
      
      <t>
         
         Nonetheless, this approach has the potential to create an unofficial new 
         private address range without proper scrutiny.
         
      </t>
      
</section>

<section title="Potential Consequences of Not Redefining Existing Unicast Space
  as Private Address Space" anchor="Unicast_Space">
      
<t>

If additional private address space is not defined and the large network operators
affected by this problem are not able to solve their problems with IPv6 address
space or by segmenting their networks into multiple routing domains, those networks
will need unique IPv4 addresses. It is possible and even likely that a single 
network could consume a whole IPv4 /8 in a year. At the time this document is
being written, there are
just 24 unallocated IPv4 /8s, so it would not take many such requests to make a major
dent in the available IPv4 address space. <xref target="POTAROO"/> provides an analysis of
IPv4 address consumption and projects the date on which the IANA and RIR pools will be 
fully allocated.
   
</t>      

</section>

<section title="Redefining Future Use Space as Unicast Address Space">
      
<t>

There have also been proposals to re-designate the former Class E space (240.0.0.0/4) as
unicast address space. <xref target="WILSON"/> suggests that it should be 
privately scoped while <xref target="FULLER"/> does not propose a scope. 
Both proposals note that existing deployed equipment may not be able to use addresses 
from 240.0.0.0/4. Potential users would need to be sure of the status of the equipment 
on their network and the networks with which they intend to communicate.
      
</t>
   
<t>

It is not immediately clear how useful 240.0.0.0/4 could be in practice. While 
<xref target="FULLER"/> documents the status of several popular
desktop and server operating systems, the status of the most widely deployed 
routers and switches is less clear, and it is possible that 240.0.0.0/4 might
only be useful in very large, new green field deployments where full control
of all deployed systems is available. However, in such cases it might well
be easier to deploy an IPv6 network.
