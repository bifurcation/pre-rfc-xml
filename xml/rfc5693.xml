        Distributed applications -- such as file sharing, real-time
        communication, and live and on-demand media streaming --
        prevalent on the Internet use a significant amount of network
        resources.  Such applications often transfer large amounts of
        data through connections established between nodes distributed
        across the Internet with little knowledge of the underlying
        network topology.  Some applications are so designed that they
        choose a random subset of peers from a larger set with which to exchange
        data.  Absent any topology information guiding such
        choices, or acting on suboptimal or local information
        obtained from measurements and statistics, these applications
        often make less than desirable choices.

        This document discusses issues related to an
        information-sharing service that enables applications to
        perform better-than-random peer selection.

      <section title="Overview">
        <t>
          Distributed applications, both peer-to-peer (P2P) and
          client/server used for file sharing, real-time
          communication, and live and on-demand media streaming, use a
          significant amount of network capacity and CPU cycles in the
          routers <xref target="WWW.wired.fuel"/>.  In contrast to
          centralized applications, distributed applications access
          resources such as files or media relays distributed across
          the Internet and exchange large amounts of data in
          connections that they establish directly with nodes sharing
          such resources.
        </t>
        <t>
          One advantage of highly distributed systems results from
          the fact that the resources such systems offer are often
          available through multiple replicas. However, applications
          generally do not have reliable information of the underlying
          network and thus have to select among the available peers
          that provide such replicas randomly or based on information
          they deduce from partial observations that, in some
          situations, lead to suboptimal choices. For example, one
          peer-selection algorithm is based only on the measurements
          during initial connection establishment between two
          peers. Since actual data transmission does not begin, the
          algorithm measures only the round-trip time and cannot
          reliably deduce actual throughput between the peers. Thus,
          such a peer-selection algorithm that simply uses round-trip
          time may result in a suboptimal choice of peers.
        </t>
        <t>
          Many of today's P2P systems use an overlay network
          consisting of direct peer connections. Such connections
          often do not account for the underlying network topology. In
          addition to having suboptimal performance, such networks can
          lead to congestion and cause serious inefficiencies. As
          shown in <xref target="ACM.fear"/>, traffic generated by
          popular P2P applications often cross network boundaries
          multiple times, overloading links that are frequently
          subject to congestion <xref
          target="ACM.bottleneck"/>. Moreover, such transits, besides
          resulting in a poor experience for the user, can be quite
          costly to the network operator.
        </t>
        <t>
          Recent studies (<xref target="ACM.ispp2p"/>, <xref
          target="WWW.p4p.overview"/>, <xref target="ACM.ono"/>) show a
          possible solution to this problem. Internet Service
          Providers (ISPs), network operators, or third parties can
          collect more reliable network information. This information
          includes relevant information such as topology or link
          capacity. Normally, such information changes on a much
          longer time scale than information used for congestion
          control on the transport layer. Providing this information
          to P2P applications can enable them to apply
          better-than-random peer selection with respect to the
          underlying network topology. As a result, it may be possible
          to increase application performance, reduce congestion, and
          decrease the overall amount of traffic across different
          networks. Presumably, both applications and the network
          operator can benefit from such information. Thus, network
          operators have an incentive to provide, either directly
          themselves or indirectly through a third party, such
          information; applications have an incentive to use such
          information. This document discusses issues related to an
          information-sharing service that enables applications to
          perform better-than-random peer selection.

        resource directories can use such a protocol as ALTO clients
        to query an ALTO server. The mapping of topological
        information onto an ALTO service as well as the application

    <section anchor="problem" title="The Problem">
      <t>

        Network engineers have been facing the problem of traffic
        optimization for a long time and have designed mechanisms like
        <xref target="RFC3031">MPLS</xref> and <xref
        target="RFC3260">Diffserv</xref> to deal with it. The problem
        these protocols address consists in finding (or setting)
        optimal routes (or optimal queues in routers) for 
	packets traveling between specific source and
        destination addresses. Solutions are based on
        requirements such as low latency, high reliability, and
        priority. Such solutions are usually implemented
        at the link and network layers and tend to be almost
        transparent.

      </t>
      <t>
        However, distributed applications in general and, in particular,
        bandwidth-greedy P2P applications that are used, for example, for
        file sharing, cannot directly use the
        aforementioned techniques. By cooperating with external
        services that are aware of the network topology, applications
        could greatly improve the traffic they generate. In fact, when
        a P2P application needs to establish a connection, the logical
        target is not a stable host, but rather a resource (e.g., a
        file or a media relay) that can be available in multiple
        instances on different peers. Selection of a good host from an
        overlay topological proximity has a large impact on the
        overall traffic generated. 
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style="empty">
          <t>
            Note that while traffic considerations are important,
            several other factors also play a role on the performance
            experienced by users of distributed applications.  These
            include the need to avoid overloading individual nodes,
            fetching rare pieces of a file before those pieces are
            available at a multiplicity of nodes, and so on.  However,
            better information about topological conditions does
            improve the overall selection algorithm on an important
            aspect.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Better-than-random peer selection is helpful in the initial
        phase of the process. Consider a P2P protocol in which a
        querying peer receives a list of candidate destinations where
        a resource resides. From this list, the peer will derive a
        smaller set of candidates to connect to and exchange
        information with. In another example, a streaming video client
        may be provided with a list of destinations from which it can
        stream content.  In both cases, the use of topology
        information in an early stage will allow applications to
        improve their performance and will help ISPs make a better use
        of their network resources. In particular, an economic goal
        for ISPs is to reduce the transit traffic on interdomain
        links.
      </t>
      <t>
        Addressing the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
        problem means, on the one hand, deploying an ALTO service to
        provide applications with information regarding the underlying
        network and, on the other hand, enhancing applications in
        order to use such information to perform better-than-random
        selection of the endpoints with which they establish connections.

    <section anchor="usecases" title="Use Cases">
      <section title="File sharing">
        <t>
          File-sharing applications allow users to search for content
          shared by other users and to download respective resources
          from other users. For instance, search results can consist
          of many instances of the same file (or chunk of a file)
          available from multiple sources. The goal of an ALTO
          solution is to help peers find the best ones according to
          the underlying networks.
        </t>
        <t>
          On the application side, integration of ALTO functionalities
          may happen at different levels. For example, in the
          completely decentralized Gnutella network, selection of the
          best sources is totally up to the user. In systems like
          BitTorrent and eDonkey, central elements such as trackers or
          servers act as mediators.  Therefore, in the former case,
          improvement would require modification in the applications,
          while in the latter it could just be implemented in some
          central elements.
        </t>

      <section title="Cache/Mirror Selection">
        <t>
          Providers of popular content, like media and software
          repositories, usually resort to geographically distributed
          caches and mirrors for load balancing. Today, selection of the
          proper mirror/cache for a given user is based on
          inaccurate geolocation data, on proprietary network-location
          systems, or is often delegated to the user herself. An ALTO
          solution could be easily adopted to ease such a selection in
          an automated way.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Live Media Streaming">
        <t>
          P2P applications for live streaming allow users to receive
          multimedia content produced by one source and targeted to
          multiple destinations, in a real-time or near-real-time
          way. This is particularly important for users or networks
          that do not support multicast. Peers often participate in
          the distribution of the content, acting as both receivers
          and senders. The goal of an ALTO solution is to help a peer
          to find effective communicating peers that exchange the
          media content.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Real-Time Communications">
        <t>
          P2P real-time communications allow users to establish direct
          media flows for real-time audio, video, and real-time text
          calls or to have text chats. In the basic case, media flows
          directly between the two endpoints.  Unfortunately, however, a
          significant portion of users have limited access to the
          Internet due to NATs, firewalls, or proxies.  Thus, other
          elements need to relay the media. Such media relays are
          distributed over the Internet with public addresses. An
          ALTO solution needs to help peers find the best
          relays.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Distributed Hash Tables">
        <t>
          Distributed hash tables (DHTs) are a class of overlay
          algorithms used to implement lookup functionalities in
          popular P2P systems, without using centralized elements. In
          such systems, a peer maintains the addresses of a set of
          other peers participating in the same DHT in a routing
          table, sorted according to specific criteria. An ALTO
          solution can provide valuable information for DHT
          algorithms.

    <section anchor="solution" title="Aspects of the Problem">
      <t>
        This section introduces some aspects of the problem that some
        people may not be aware of when they first start studying the
        problem space.
      </t>

      <section title="Information Provided by an ALTO Service">
        <t>
          The goal of an ALTO service is to provide applications with
          information they can use to perform better-than-random peer
          selection.  In principle, there are many types of
          information that can help applications in peer selection.
          However, not all of the information to be conveyed is
          amenable to an ALTO-like service.  More specifically,
          information that can change very rapidly, such as
          transport-layer congestion, is out of scope for an ALTO
          service.  Such information is better suited to be transferred through an
          in-band technique at the transport layer instead of an
          ALTO-like, out-of-band technique at the application layer.
          An ALTO solution for congestion will either have outdated
          information or must be contacted too frequently by
          applications.  And finally, information such as end-to-end
          delay and available bandwidth can be more accurately
          measured by applications, themselves.
        </t>
        <t>
          The kind of information that is meaningful to convey to
          applications via an out-of-band ALTO service is any
          information that applications cannot easily obtain
          themselves and that changes on a much longer time scale
          than the instantaneous information used for congestion
          control on the transport layer. Examples for such
          information are operator's policies, geographical location
          or network proximity (e.g., the topological distance between
          two peers), the transmission costs associated with
          sending/receiving a certain amount of data to/from a peer,
          or the remaining amount of traffic allowed by a peer's
          operator (e.g., in case of quotas or limited flat-rate
          pricing models).
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="ALTO Service Providers">
        <t>
          At least three different kinds of entities can provide ALTO
          services:

          <list style="numbers">
            <t>
              Network operators. Network operators usually have full
              knowledge of the network they administer and are aware
              of their network topology and policies.
            </t>
            <t>
              Third parties. Third parties are entities separate from
              network operators but that may either have collected
              network information or have arrangements with network
              operators to learn the network information. Examples of
              such entities are content-delivery networks like Akamai,
              which control wide and highly distributed
              infrastructures, or companies providing an ALTO service
              on behalf of ISPs.
            </t>
            <t>
              User communities. User communities run distributed
              algorithms, for example, for estimating the topology of
              the Internet.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="ALTO Service Implementation">
        <t>
          It is important for the reader to understand there are
          significant user communities that expect an ALTO server to
          be a centralized service. Likewise, there are other user
          communities that expect the ALTO service be a distributed
          service, possibly even based on or integrating with a P2P
          service.
        </t>
        <t>
          As a result, one can reasonably expect there to be
          some sort of service-discovery mechanism to go along with
          the ALTO protocol definition.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="user-priv" title="User Privacy">
        <t>
          On the one hand, there are data elements an ALTO client
          could provide in its query to an ALTO server that could help
          increase the level of accuracy in the replies. For example,
          if the querying client indicates what kind of application it
          is using (e.g., real-time communications or bulk data
          transfer), the server will be able to indicate priorities in
          its replies, accommodating the requirements of the traffic
          the application will generate. On the other hand,
          applications might consider such information private. In
          addition, some applications may not know a priori what kind
          of request they will be making.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Topology Hiding">
        <t>
          Operators, with their intimate knowledge of their network
          topology, can play an important role in addressing the ALTO
          problem. However, operators often consider revealing details
          of such network information to be confidential.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Coexistence with Caching">
        <t>
          Caching is an approach to improving traffic generated by
          applications, and it requires large amounts of data
          transfers. In some cases, such techniques have proven to be
          extremely effective in both enhancing user experience and
          saving network resources.
        </t>
        <t>
          A cache, either explicitly or transparently, replaces the
          content source. Thus, a cache must, in principle, use and
          support the same protocol as the querying peer. That is, if
          a cache stores web content, it must present an HTTP
          interface to the web client. Any cache solution for a given
          protocol needs to present that same protocol to the
          client. Said differently, each caching solution for a
          different protocol needs to implement that specific
          protocol. For this reason, one can only reasonably expect
          caching solutions for the most popular protocols, such as
          HTTP and BitTorrent.
        </t>
        <t>
          It is extremely important to realize that caching and ALTO
          are entirely orthogonal. ALTO, especially if it is aware of
          caches, can in fact direct clients to nearby caches where
          the user could get a much better quality of experience.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        This document is neither a requirements document nor a
        protocol specification. However, we believe it is important
        for the reader to understand areas of security and privacy
        that will be important for the design and implementation of an
        ALTO solution. Moreover, issues such as digital rights
        management are out of scope for ALTO, as they are not
        technically enforceable at this level.
      </t>
      <t>
        Some environments and use cases of ALTO may require client or
        server authentication before providing sensitive
        information. In order to support those environments
        interoperably, <xref target="ALTO-REQS">the ALTO
        requirements document</xref> outlines minimum-to-implement
        authentication and other security requirements.
      </t>
      <t>
        Applications can decide to rely on information provided by an
        ALTO server to enhance the peer-selection process. In
        principle, this enables the ALTO service that provides such
        information to influence the behavior of the application,
        basically letting a third-party -- the ALTO service provider
        -- take an important role in a distributed system it was not
        previously involved in.
      </t>
      <t>
        For example, in the case of an ALTO server deployed and run by
        an ISP, the P2P community might consider such a server hostile because
        the operator could:

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            use ALTO to prevent content distribution and enforce
            copyrights;
          </t>
          <t>
            redirect applications to corrupted mediators providing
            malicious content;
          </t>
          <t>
            track connections to perform content inspection or
            logging;
          </t>
          <t>
            apply policies based on criteria other than network
            efficiency.  For example, the service provider may suggest
            routes suboptimal from the user's perspective in order to avoid
            peering points regulated by inconvenient economic
            agreements.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        It is important to note there is no protocol mechanism to
        require ALTO for P2P applications. If, for some reason, ALTO
        fails to improve the performance of P2P applications, ALTO
        will not gain popularity and the P2P community will not use
        it.
      </t>
      <t>
        At the time of this writing, the privacy issues described in
        <xref target="user-priv" /> are relevant for an ALTO solution. Users
        may be reluctant to disclose sensitive information to an ALTO
        server.  Operators, on the other hand, may not wish to
        disclose information that would expose details of their
        interior topology. When exploring the solution space in
        detail, one needs to consider these issues so that an ALTO
        protocol does not presume mandatory information disclosure, by
        either clients or servers.
