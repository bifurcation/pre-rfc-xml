    <abstract>

<t>This document describes a number of changes to TLS and DTLS IANA registries
that range from adding notes to the registry all the way to changing
the registration policy.  These changes were mostly motivated by WG
review of the TLS- and DTLS-related registries undertaken as part of the
TLS 1.3 development process.</t>

<t>This document updates the following RFCs: 3749, 5077, 4680, 5246, 5705,
5878, 6520, and 7301.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Per this document, IANA has made changes to a number of IANA registries
related to Transport
Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).  These changes were almost entirely motivated by the
development of TLS 1.3 <xref target="RFC8446"/>.</t>

<t>The changes introduced by this document range from simple, e.g., adding
notes, to complex, e.g., changing a registry's registration policy.
Instead of listing the changes and their rationale here in the introduction, each section provides rationale for the proposed
change(s).</t>

<t>This document proposes no changes to the registration policies for TLS
Alerts <xref target="RFC8446"/>, TLS ContentType <xref target="RFC8446"/>,
TLS HandshakeType <xref target="RFC8446"/>, and TLS Certificate Status
Types <xref target="RFC6961"/> registries; the existing policies (Standards Action
for the first three; IETF Review for the last), are appropriate for
these one-byte code points because of their scarcity.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

        <t>
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
    described in BCP&nbsp;14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> 
    when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
        </t>

</section>
<section anchor="add-tls-to-registry-names" title='Adding "TLS" to Registry Names'>

<t>For consistency amongst TLS registries, IANA
has prepended "TLS" to the following registries:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs <xref target="RFC7301"/>,</t>
  <t>ExtensionType Values,</t>
  <t>Heartbeat Message Types <xref target="RFC6520"/>, and</t>
  <t>Heartbeat Modes <xref target="RFC6520"/>.</t>
</list></t>

<t>IANA has updated the reference for these four registries
to also refer to this document.  The remainder of this document will
use the registry names with the "TLS" prefix.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="aligning-with-rfc-8126" title="Aligning with RFC 8126">

<t>
  Many of the TLS-related IANA registries had the registration
  procedure "IETF Consensus", which was changed to "IETF Review" 
  by <xref target="RFC8126"/>.  To align with the new terminology, IANA has 
  updated the following registries to "IETF Review":
</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>TLS Authorization Data Formats <xref target="RFC4680"/></t>
  <t>TLS Supplemental Data Formats (SupplementalDataType) <xref target="RFC5878"/></t>
</list></t>

<t>This is not a universal change, as some registries originally defined
with "IETF Consensus" are undergoing other changes either as a result
of this document, <xref target="RFC8446"/>, or <xref target="RFC8422"/>.</t>

<t>IANA has updated the reference for these two registries
to also refer to this document.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="adding-recommended-column" title='Adding "Recommended" Column'>

<t>Per this document, a "Recommended" column has been added to many of
the TLS registries to indicate parameters that are generally recommended
for implementations to support.  Adding a "Recommended" parameter (i.e., "Y") to a
registry or updating a parameter to "Recommended" status requires
Standards Action.  Not all parameters defined in Standards Track
documents need to be marked as "Recommended".</t>

<t>If an item is not marked as "Recommended" (i.e., "N"), it does not necessarily mean
that it is flawed; rather, it indicates that the item either has not
been through the IETF consensus process, has limited applicability, or
is intended only for specific use cases.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="session-ticket-tls-extension" title="Session Ticket TLS Extension">

<t>The nomenclature for the registry entries in the TLS ExtensionType
Values registry correspond to the presentation language field name
except for entry 35.  To ensure that the values in the registry are
consistently identified in the registry, IANA:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>has renamed entry 35 to "session_ticket (renamed from
"SessionTicket TLS")" <xref target="RFC5077"/>.</t>
  <t>has added a reference to this document in the "Reference"
column for entry 35.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="tls-extensiontype-values" title="TLS ExtensionType Values">

<t>Experience has shown that the IETF Review registry policy for TLS
extensions was too strict.  Based on WG consensus, the decision was
taken to change the registration policy to Specification Required
<xref target="RFC8126"/> while reserving a small part of the code space for
private use.  Therefore, IANA has
updated the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as follows:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Changed the registry policy to:  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Values with the first byte in the range 0-254 (decimal) are assigned
  via Specification Required <xref target="RFC8126"></xref>.  Values with the first byte
  255 (decimal) are reserved for Private Use <xref target="RFC8126"></xref>.</t>

  <t>Updated the "Reference" to also refer to this document.</t>
</list></t>

<t>See <xref target="expert-pool"/> for additional information about the designated
expert pool.</t>

<t>Despite wanting to "loosen" the registration policies for TLS
extensions, it is still useful to indicate in the IANA registry which
extensions the WG recommends be supported.  Therefore, IANA has updated the
TLS ExtensionType Values registry as follows:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Added a "Recommended" column with the contents as listed below.  This
table has been generated by marking Standards Track RFCs as "Y" and
all others as "N".
The "Recommended" column is assigned a value of "N" unless explicitly requested,
and adding a value with a "Recommended" value of "Y" requires Standards Action
<xref target="RFC8126"/>.
IESG Approval is REQUIRED for a Y-&gt;N transition.</t>

<t>IANA has added the following notes:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='Note:'>
  The role of the designated expert is described in RFC 8447.
The designated expert <xref target="RFC8126"/> ensures that the specification is
publicly available.   It is sufficient to have an Internet-Draft (that 
 is posted and never published as an RFC) or a document from another 
 standards body, industry consortium, university site, etc.  The expert may provide
more in-depth reviews, but their approval should not be taken as an
endorsement of the extension.</t>
  <t hangText='Note:'>
  As specified in <xref target="RFC8126"/>, assignments made in the Private Use
space are not generally useful for broad interoperability.  It is
the responsibility of those making use of the Private Use range to
ensure that no conflicts occur (within the intended scope of use).
For widespread experiments, temporary reservations are available.</t>

  <t hangText='Note:'>
  If an item is not marked as "Recommended", it does not necessarily mean

<t>
  <xref target="RFC8446"/> also uses the TLS ExtensionType Values registry originally
  created in <xref target="RFC4366"/>.
  The following text is from <xref target="RFC8446"/> and is included here 
  to ensure alignment between these specifications.
</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>IANA has updated this registry to include the

and "signature_algorithms_cert" extensions with the values
defined in <xref target="RFC8446"/> and the "Recommended" value of "Y".</t>
  <t>IANA has updated this registry to include a "TLS
1.3" column that lists the messages in which the extension may
appear.  This column has been initially populated from
the table in Section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC8446"/> with any
extension not listed there marked as "-" to indicate that it is not

<section anchor="tls-cipher-suite-registry" title="TLS Cipher Suites Registry">

<t>Experience has shown that the IETF Consensus registry policy for TLS
Cipher Suites was too strict.  Based on WG consensus, the decision was
taken to change the TLS Cipher Suites registry's registration policy
to Specification Required <xref target="RFC8126"/> while reserving a small part of
the code space for private use.  Therefore, IANA
has updated the TLS Cipher Suites registry's policy as
follows:

<list>
  <t>

  </t>
</list>
</t>

<t>See <xref target="expert-pool"/> for additional information about the designated

<t>The TLS Cipher Suites registry has grown significantly and will continue to
do so.  To better guide those not intimately involved in TLS, IANA
has updated the TLS Cipher Suites registry as follows:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Added a "Recommended" column to the TLS Cipher Suites registry.  The
cipher suites that follow in the two tables are marked as "Y". All
other cipher suites are marked as "N".

<t>The TLS 1.3 cipher suites specified by <xref target="RFC8446"/> are
not listed here; that document provides for their "Recommended" status.</t>

<t>Despite the following behavior being misguided, experience has shown
that some customers use the IANA registry as a checklist against which
to measure an implementation's completeness, and some implementers
blindly implement cipher suites.  Therefore, IANA has added
the following warning to the registry:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='WARNING:'>
  Cryptographic algorithms and parameters will be broken or weakened
over time.  Blindly implementing cipher suites listed here is not
advised.  Implementers and users need to check that the cryptographic
algorithms listed continue to provide the expected level of security.</t>
</list></t>

<t>IANA has added the following note to ensure that those that
focus on IANA registries are aware that TLS 1.3 <xref target="RFC8446"/>
uses the same registry but defines ciphers differently:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='Note:'>
  Although TLS 1.3 uses the same cipher suite space as previous
versions of TLS, TLS 1.3 cipher suites are defined differently, only
specifying the symmetric ciphers and hash function, and cannot be used for TLS 1.2.
Similarly, TLS 1.2 and lower cipher suite values cannot be used with
TLS 1.3.</t>
</list></t>

<t>IANA has added the following notes to document the rules
for populating the "Recommended" column:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">


  <t hangText='Note:'>
  CCM_8 cipher suites are not marked as "Recommended".  These cipher
suites have a significantly truncated authentication tag that represents
a security trade-off that may not be appropriate for general
environments.</t>

that it is flawed; rather, it indicates that the item either has not

<section anchor="tls-supported-groups" title="TLS Supported Groups">

<t>Similar to cipher suites, supported groups have proliferated over time,
and some use the registry to measure implementations.  Therefore, IANA
has added a "Recommended" column with a "Y" for secp256r1,
secp384r1, x25519, and x448, while all others are "N".  These "Y"
groups are taken from Standards Track RFCs; <xref target="RFC8422"/>
elevates secp256r1 and secp384r1 to Standards Track.  Not all groups from

<section anchor="expert-pool" title="Designated Expert Pool">

<t>Specification Required <xref target="RFC8126"/> registry requests are registered
after a three-week review period on the &lt;tls-reg-review@ietf.org&gt;
mailing list, on the advice of one or more designated experts.
However, to allow for the allocation of values prior to publication,
the designated experts may approve registration once they are
satisfied that such a specification will be published.</t>

<t>Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review SHOULD use an
appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to register value in TLS bar
registry").</t>

<t>Within the review period, the designated experts will either approve or
deny the registration request, communicating this decision to the review
list and IANA.  Denials SHOULD include an explanation and, if applicable,
suggestions as to how to make the request successful.  Registration
requests that are undetermined for a period longer than 21 days can be
brought to the IESG's attention (using the &lt;iesg@ietf.org&gt; mailing list)
for resolution.</t>

<t>Criteria that SHOULD be applied by the designated experts includes
determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing
functionality, whether it is likely to be of general applicability
or useful only for a single application, and whether the registration
description is clear.</t>

<t>IANA MUST only accept registry updates from the designated experts and
SHOULD direct all requests for registration to the review mailing list.</t>

<t>It is suggested that multiple designated experts be appointed who are
able to represent the perspectives of different applications using this
specification, in order to enable broadly informed review of
registration decisions.  In cases where a registration decision could
be perceived as creating a conflict of interest for a particular
Expert, that Expert SHOULD defer to the judgment of the other Experts.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<t>The change to Specification Required from IETF Review lowers the amount
of review provided by the WG for cipher suites and supported groups.
This change reflects reality in that the WG essentially provided no
cryptographic review of the cipher suites or supported groups.  This
was especially true of national cipher suites.</t>

<t>Recommended algorithms are regarded as secure for general use at the
time of registration; however, cryptographic algorithms and parameters
will be broken or weakened over time.  It is possible that the
"Recommended" status in the registry lags behind the most recent advances
in cryptanalysis.  Implementers and users need to check that the
cryptographic algorithms listed continue to provide the expected level
of security.</t>



<t>Designated experts ensure the specification is publicly available.  They may
provide more in-depth reviews.  Their review should not be taken as an
endorsement of the cipher suite, extension, supported group, etc.</t>
