    <abstract>
      <t>This document captures the rationale for the
      changes introduced in RFC 8524, "Update to the Process for Selection of
      Trustees for the IETF Trust".</t>
      
      <t>At the time RFC 8524 was published, IETF administrative
      structure changes ("IASA 2.0") had an impact on the IETF
      Trust because members of the IETF Administrative Oversight
      Committee (IAOC), which was being phased out, had served as
      Trustees of the IETF Trust. This document provides
      background on the past IETF Trust arrangements, explains the
      effect of the rules in the founding documents during the
      transition to the new arrangement, and provides a rationale for
      the update.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      
      <t>This document captures the rationale for the
      changes introduced in <xref
      target="RFC8524"/>.</t>
      
      <t>At the time <xref target="RFC8524"/> was
      published, IETF administrative structure changes ("IASA 2.0")
      had an impact on the IETF Trust <xref target="RFC4071"/> <xref
      target="RFC4371"/> <xref target="IASA2"/>. This
      is because members of the IETF Administrative
      Oversight Committee (IAOC), which was being phased out, had
      served as Trustees of the IETF Trust.  A minimal change
      regarding the selection of the Trustees is implemented by <xref
      target="RFC8524"/>.</t>
      
      <t>This companion memo provides some background on the details
      of the past IETF Trust arrangements, explains the effect of
      the rules in the founding documents during the transition to the new
      arrangement, and provides a rationale for the update.</t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="background" title="Background">
      
      <t>The purpose of the IETF Trust is to acquire, hold, maintain,
      and license certain existing and future intellectual property
      and other property used in connection with the administration of
      the IETF <xref target="RFC4371"/>. The intellectual property is,
      for instance, rights that the IETF contributors grant for text
      in RFCs and Internet-Drafts. The IETF Trust also manages
      trademarks such as "IETF" and domain names such as
      "ietf.org". The IETF Trust is also serving the broader Internet
      community by holding domains and trademarks associated with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) <xref
      target="RFC7979"/>.</t>
      
      <t>The IETF Trust is a legal entity, registered in the
      Commonwealth of Virginia <xref target="Trust-FD"/>.</t>
      
      <t>Previously, the members of the IAOC also served as ex officio
      Trustees of the IETF Trust. The founding documents specify
      persons eligible to become Trustees as having to be then-current
      members of the IAOC <xref target="Trust-FD"/>.  The documents
      also specify that if for any reason there are fewer than three
      individuals serving as Trustees, then the Internet Engineering 
      Steering Group (IESG), or the IESG's successor as the leadership 
      of the IETF, shall appoint one or more individuals to serve in a 
      temporary capacity as Trustee(s) until eligible persons can be found.</t>
      
      <t>In the previous system, there were eight IAOC members. Two were
      named by the IETF Nominating Committee (NomCom), one by the Internet
      Engineering Steering Group (IESG), one by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), and one by 
      the Internet Society (ISOC) Board of Trustees. There 
      were three ex officio members via their roles as IETF Chair, ISOC CEO, 
      and IAB Chair. In addition, the IETF Administrative Director (IAD)
      served also as one of the Trustees.</t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="approach" title="General Approach">
      
      <t>There were two basic approaches to resolving the issue with
      the Trustees once the IAOC ceased to exist.  One approach would be to
      merge all IETF Trust functions in the new IASA structure and
      under the new legal entity. However, this memo advocates a second
      approach where the IETF Trust is kept independent.</t>
      
      <t>The rationale for advocating the second approach is, in part,
      to minimize changes to the IETF Trust while the IETF's
      administrative structure is undergoing major change.  In
      addition, the IETF Trust and other administrative IETF processes
      are quite different. While very important, the IETF Trust is a
      low-activity entity where changes are minimal and gradual, and
      there are no pressing issues.</t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="selection" title="Changing the Way Trustees Are Selected">
      
      <t>When the Trustees were serving on both the IETF Trust and the
      IAOC, many of the requirements for naming a particular group of
      people were driven by the IAOC's requirements.  For the IETF
      Trust in the new model, some of those arrangements were 
      rethought, both in terms of the number and source of the
      Trustees, as well as the desired qualifications and length of
      terms.</t>
      
      <t>Several options were possible, of course. 
   A newly designed selection process could have been devised, but in this
   document we argue for limited change based largely on the fact that a) the IETF
   Trust arrangements worked generally well, b) the expected time commitment
   is expected to be modest, and c) the assets need very careful management.</t>
      
      <t>As a result, a smaller group of Trustees appeared sufficient.</t>
      
      <t>In addition, the terms set for the
      Trustees selected from the IETF community could be longer than
      the two year period typical of other IETF bodies.</t>
      
      <t>One could have continued the practice of having the chairs and CEOs
      from the IETF, IAB, and Internet Society be Trustees as well, but
      this may not be necessary. In general, the tasks of the IETF
      Trust are well defined, and while there is a need for
      coordination, it does not need to be at the level of chairs or
      CEOs.</t>

      <t>Given all this, one approach was to have Trustees appointed
      by the NomCom, the IESG, and the ISOC Board of Trustees. (One might also
      have considered the IETF Administration LLC legal entity instead
      of the Internet Society for this role, but the Internet Society
      is perhaps more suitable for the role given their focus on the
      broad use of the IETF Trust assets and not merely administrative
      aspects.)</t>
      
      <t>If the same principles used for previous appointments continued to be
      used, then appointments performed by the NomCom would need to be
      confirmed by another entity. This could be, for instance, either the
      IESG or the IAB. The IESG had previously been the confirming body for
      the IAOC, so it has been retained in that role for the Trustees.</t>
      
    </section>

    <section anchor="transition" title="Transition">
      
      <t>When the new entity for the IETF Administration LLC was set up,
      the IAOC was expected to be discontinued soon
      thereafter. Fortunately, there was no pressing need to change
      all the components of the IAOC and its dependent organizations
      at the same time. As discussed in <xref
      target="background"/>, the IESG holds the ability to continue
      to name Trustees. Once the updated procedures were in place,
      the IETF Trust had its management nominated in the usual manner,
      and the exceptional IESG process was no longer needed.</t>
