  <abstract>
    <t>
      This document defines a mechanism by which a Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP) server acting as a traditional Private Branch
      Exchange (PBX) can register with a SIP Service Provider
      (SSP) to receive phone calls for SIP User Agents (UAs).  In
      order to function properly, this mechanism requires that each
      of the Addresses of Record (AORs) registered in bulk map 
      to a unique set of contacts. This requirement is satisfied by AORs representing phone
      numbers regardless of the domain, since phone numbers are
      fully qualified and globally unique. This document therefore
      focuses on this use case.
    </t>
  </abstract>

  <section title="Introduction">
    <t>
      The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an
      application-layer control (signaling) protocol for creating,
      modifying, and terminating sessions with one or more participants.
      One of SIP's primary functions is providing rendezvous between
      users. By design, these rendezvous have been provided through
      a combination of the server look-up procedures defined in
      RFC 3263 <xref target="RFC3263"/> and the registrar procedures
      described in RFC 3261 <xref target="RFC3261"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
      The intention of the original protocol design was that any
      user's AOR (Address of Record) would be handled by the authority
      indicated by the hostport portion of the AOR. The users
      would register individual reachability information with this
      authority, which would then route incoming requests accordingly.
    </t>
    <t>
      In actual deployments, some SIP servers have been deployed
      in architectures that, for various reasons, have
      requirements to provide dynamic routing information
      for large blocks of AORs, where all of the AORs in
      the block were to be handled by the same server. For
      purposes of efficiency, many of these deployments do
      not wish to maintain separate registrations for each of
      the AORs in the block. Thus, an alternate mechanism to provide dynamic routing
      information for blocks of AORs is desirable.
    </t>
    <t>
      Although the use of SIP REGISTER request messages
      to update reachability
      information for multiple users simultaneously is somewhat
      beyond the original semantics defined for REGISTER requests
      by RFC 3261 <xref target="RFC3261"/>, this
      approach has seen significant deployment in certain
      environments. In particular, deployments in which small
      to medium SIP-PBX servers are addressed using E.164 numbers
      have used this mechanism to avoid the need to maintain
      DNS entries or static IP addresses for the SIP-PBX servers.
    </t>
    <t>
      In recognition of the momentum that REGISTER-based approaches
      have seen in deployments, this document defines a REGISTER-based
      approach.  Since E.164-addressed UAs are very common today
      in SIP-PBX environments, and since SIP URIs in which the user
      portion is an E.164 number are always globally unique, regardless
      of the domain, this document focuses on registration of SIP
      URIs in which the user portion is an E.164 number.
    </t>

  <section title="Constraints" anchor="constraints">
    <t>
      Within the problem space that has been established for
      this work, several constraints shape our solution. These
      are defined in the MARTINI requirements document
      <xref target="RFC5947"/> and are analyzed in
      <xref target="reqs"/>.
      In terms of impact to the solution at hand, the following
      two constraints have the most profound effect:
      (1) The SIP-PBX cannot be assumed to be assigned a static
          IP address; and 
      (2) No DNS entry can be relied upon to consistently resolve
          to the IP address of the SIP-PBX.

    <xref target="RFC2119" />.</t>

   Although SIP is a text-based protocol, some of the examples in this
   document cannot
   be unambiguously rendered without additional markup due to the
   constraints placed on the formatting of RFCs.  This document uses the
   &lt;allOneLine/> markup convention established in 
   RFC 4475 <xref target="RFC4475"/> to avoid
   ambiguity and meet the RFC layout requirements.  For the
   sake of completeness, the text defining this markup (Section 2.1
   of RFC 4475 <xref target="RFC4475"/>)

      Several of these examples contain unfolded lines longer than 72

      single unfolded line is reconstructed by directly concatenating
      all lines appearing between the tags (discarding any line feeds or
      carriage returns).  There will be no whitespace at the end of
      lines.  Any whitespace appearing at a fold-point will appear at
      the beginning of a line.

  <section title="Mechanism Overview">
    <t>
      The overall mechanism is achieved using a REGISTER
      request with a specially formatted Contact URI.
      This document also defines an option tag that can be used to
      ensure that a registrar and any intermediaries understand the
      mechanism described herein.
    </t>
    <t>
      The Contact URI itself is tagged with a URI parameter
      to indicate that it actually represents multiple
      phone-number-associated contacts.
    </t>
    <t>
      We also define some lightweight extensions to the Globally Routable
      UA URIs (GRUU) mechanism defined by RFC 5627 <xref target="RFC5627"/>
      to allow the use of public and temporary GRUUs assigned by
      the SSP. 
    </t>
    <t>
      Aside from these extensions, the REGISTER request itself
      is processed by a registrar in the same way as normal
      registrations: by updating its location service with
      additional AOR-to-Contact bindings.
    </t>
    <t>
      Note that the list of AORs associated with a
      SIP-PBX is a matter of local provisioning at the SSP and
      the SIP-PBX. The mechanism defined in this document
      does not provide any means to detect or recover from
      provisioning mismatches (although the registration
      event package can be used as a standardized means
      for auditing such AORs;
      see <xref target="pbx-reg-event"/>).
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Registering for Multiple Phone Numbers">
    <section title="SIP-PBX Behavior" anchor="sip-pbx">
      <t>
        To register for multiple AORs, the SIP-PBX sends
        a REGISTER request to the SSP. This REGISTER request varies
        from a typical REGISTER request in two important ways. First,
        it MUST contain an option tag of "gin"
        in both a "Require" header field and a "Proxy-Require"
        header field.  (The option tag "gin" is an acronym for
        "generate implicit numbers".)
        Second, in at least 
        one "Contact" header field, it MUST include a Contact
        URI that contains the URI parameter "bnc" (which stands
        for "bulk number contact") and has no user
        portion (hence no "@" symbol).
        A URI with a "bnc" parameter MUST NOT contain a
        user portion. Except for the SIP URI "user" parameter,
        this URI MAY contain any other parameters that the
        SIP-PBX desires. These parameters will be echoed back by
        the SSP in any requests bound for the SIP-PBX.
      </t>
      <t>
        Because of the constraints
        discussed in <xref target="constraints"/>, the host
        portion of the Contact URI will generally contain
        an IP address, although nothing in this mechanism
        enforces or relies upon that fact. If the SIP-PBX operator
        chooses to maintain DNS entries that resolve to the
        IP address of his SIP-PBX via RFC 3263 resolution procedures,
        then this mechanism works just fine with domain names
        in the "Contact" header field.
      </t>
      <t>

	The "bnc" URI parameter indicates that special interpretation
	of the Contact URI is necessary: instead of indicating the
	insertion of a single Contact URI into the location service,
	it indicates that multiple URIs (one for each associated
	AOR) should be inserted.
      </t>
      <t>
        Any SIP-PBX implementing the registration mechanism defined in
        this document MUST also support the path mechanism defined
        by RFC 3327 <xref target="RFC3327"/>, and MUST include a
        'path' option tag in the "Supported" header field of the REGISTER
        request (which is a stronger requirement than imposed by the
        path mechanism itself).  This behavior is necessary because
        proxies between the SIP-PBX and the registrar may need to insert
        "Path" header field values in the REGISTER request for this
        document's mechanism to function properly, and, per RFC 3327
        <xref target="RFC3327"/>, they can only do so if the User Agent Client
        (UAC) inserted the option tag in the "Supported" header field.  In
        accordance with the procedures defined in RFC 3327 <xref
        target="RFC3327"/>, the SIP-PBX is allowed to ignore the "Path"
        header fields returned in the REGISTER response.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Registrar Behavior">
      <t>
        The registrar, upon receipt of a REGISTER request 
        containing at least one "Contact" header field with
        a "bnc" parameter, will use the value in the "To" header field
        to identify the SIP-PBX for which registration is being requested.
        It then authenticates the SIP-PBX (e.g., using SIP digest
        authentication, mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS) <xref target="RFC5246"/>, or 
        some other authentication
        mechanism).  After the SIP-PBX is authenticated, the registrar
        updates its location service with a unique AOR-to-Contact
        mapping for each of the AORs associated with the
        SIP-PBX.  Semantically, each of these mappings will be treated
        as a unique row in the location service.  The actual
        implementation may, of course, perform internal optimizations
        to reduce the amount of memory used to store
        such information.
      </t>
      <t>
        For each of these unique rows, the AOR will be in the format
        that the SSP expects to receive from external parties (e.g.,
        "sip:+12145550102@ssp.example.com"). The corresponding
        contact will be formed by adding to the REGISTER request's Contact
        URI a user portion containing the fully qualified, E.164-formatted
        number (including the preceding "+" symbol) and removing
        the "bnc" parameter. Aside from the initial "+" symbol, this
        E.164-formatted number MUST consist exclusively of digits
        from 0 through 9 and explicitly MUST NOT contain any visual
        separator symbols (e.g., "-", ".", "(", or ")").  For
        example, if the "Contact" header field contains the URI
        &lt;sip:198.51.100.3:5060;bnc>, then the contact
        value
        associated with the aforementioned AOR will be
        &lt;sip:+12145550102@198.51.100.3:5060>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Although the SSP treats this registration as a number of
        discrete rows for the purpose of re-targeting incoming requests,
        the renewal, expiration, and removal of these rows is bound
        to the registered contact. In particular, this means
        that REGISTER requests that attempt to de-register a single
        AOR that has been implicitly registered MUST NOT
        remove that AOR from the bulk registration.  In this circumstance,
        the registrar simply acts as if the UA attempted to unregister
        a contact that wasn't actually registered (e.g., return the
        list of presently registered contacts in a success response).
        A further
        implication of this property is that an individual extension
        that is implicitly registered may also be explicitly registered
        using a normal, non-bulk registration (subject to SSP policy).
        If such a registration exists, it is refreshed independently
        of the bulk registration and is not removed when the bulk
        registration is removed.
      </t>
      <t>
        A registrar that receives a REGISTER request containing a
        Contact URI with both a "bnc"
        parameter and a user portion MUST NOT
        send a 200-class (Success) response. If no other error
        is applicable, the registrar can use a 400 (Bad Request)
        response to indicate this error condition.

        The rationale for support of this mechanism is given in
        <xref target="sip-pbx"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Aside from the "bnc" parameter, all URI
        parameters present
        on the Contact URI in the REGISTER request MUST be copied
        to the contact value stored in the location service.
      </t>
      <t>
        If the SSP servers perform processing based on User Agent
        Capabilities (as defined in RFC 3840 <xref target="RFC3840"/>),
        they will treat any feature tags present on a "Contact"
        header field with a "bnc" parameter in its URI as applicable 
        to all of the resulting
        AOR-to-Contact mappings. Similarly, any option tags present
        on the REGISTER request that indicate special handling
        for any subsequent requests are also applicable to all
        of the AOR-to-Contact mappings.

        This document does not modify the behavior specified
        in RFC 3261 <xref target="RFC3261"/> for inclusion
        of the "user" parameter on Request URIs. However,
        to avoid any ambiguity in handling at the SIP-PBX,

    <!-- 6 -->
    <t>
      In general, after processing the AOR-to-Contact mapping
      described in the preceding section, the SSP proxy/registrar
      (or equivalent entity) performs traditional proxy/registrar
      behavior, based on the mapping.  For any inbound SIP requests
      whose AOR indicates an E.164 number assigned to one of
      the SSP's customers, this will generally involve
      setting the target set to the registered contacts
      associated with that AOR and performing
      request forwarding as described in Section 16.6 of
      RFC 3261 <xref target="RFC3261"/>. An SSP using the mechanism
      defined in this document MUST perform
      such processing for inbound INVITE requests and SUBSCRIBE requests
      to the "reg" event package (see <xref target="reg-UA"/>)
      and SHOULD perform such processing for all other method types, 
      including unrecognized SIP methods.

      defined by the IETF.
    </t>

    <section title="Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUU)" anchor="gruu">
      <t>
        To enable advanced services to work with UAs
        behind a SIP-PBX, it is important that the GRUU
        mechanism defined by RFC 5627 
        <xref target="RFC5627"/> work correctly
        with the mechanism defined by this document -- that is,
        that user agents served by the SIP-PBX can acquire and
        use GRUUs for their own use.
      </t>

      <section title="Public GRUUs">
      <!-- 7.1.1. -->
        <t>
    
          Support of public GRUUs is OPTIONAL in SSPs and SIP-PBXes.
        </t>
        <t>
          When a SIP-PBX registers a Bulk Number Contact (a contact with
          a "bnc" parameter), and also invokes GRUU procedures for
          that contact during registration, then the SSP will
          assign a public GRUU to the SIP-PBX in the normal fashion.
          Because the URI being registered contains a "bnc" parameter,
          the GRUU will also contain a "bnc" parameter. In particular,
          this means that the GRUU will not contain a user portion.
        </t>
        <t>
        When a UA registers a contact with the SIP-PBX using GRUU procedures, the SIP-PBX provides to the UA a public GRUU formed by adding an "sg" parameter to the GRUU parameter it received from the SSP. This "sg" parameter contains a disambiguation token that the SIP-PBX can use to route inbound requests to the proper UA.
        </t>
        <t>
          So, for example, when the SIP-PBX registers with the following
          "Contact" header field:

          <figure> <artwork>
Contact: &lt;sip:198.51.100.3;bnc>;
  +sip.instance="&lt;urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6>"
          </artwork></figure>

          the SSP may choose to respond with a "Contact" header field
          that looks like this:

          <figure> <artwork>
&lt;allOneLine>
Contact: &lt;sip:198.51.100.3;bnc>;
pub-gruu="sip:ssp.example.com;bnc;gr=urn:
uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6";
+sip.instance="&lt;urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6>"
;expires=7200
&lt;/allOneLine>
          </artwork></figure>

          When its own UAs register using GRUU procedures, the SIP-PBX
          can then add  whatever device identifier it feels appropriate
          in an "sg" parameter and present this value to its
          own UAs. For example, assume the UA associated
          with the AOR "+12145550102" sent the following
          "Contact" header field in its REGISTER request:

          <figure> <artwork>
Contact: &lt;sip:line-1@10.20.1.17>;
  +sip.instance="&lt;urn:uuid:d0e2f290-104b-11df-8a39-0800200c9a66>"
          </artwork></figure>

          The SIP-PBX will add an "sg" parameter to the pub-gruu it
          received from the SSP with a token that uniquely 
          identifies the device (possibly the URN itself; possibly
          some other identifier), insert a user portion containing
          the fully qualified E.164 number associated with the
          UA, and return the result to the UA as its
          public GRUU. The resulting "Contact" header field sent from
          the SIP-PBX to the registering UA would 
          look something like this:

          <figure> <artwork>
&lt;allOneLine>
Contact: &lt;sip:line-1@10.20.1.17>;
pub-gruu="sip:+12145550102@ssp.example.com;gr=urn:
uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6;sg=00:05:03:5e:70:a6";
+sip.instance="&lt;urn:uuid:d0e2f290-104b-11df-8a39-0800200c9a66>"
;expires=3600
&lt;/allOneLine>
          </artwork></figure>
        </t>
        <t>
          When an incoming request arrives at the SSP for a GRUU
          corresponding to a bulk number contact ("bnc"), the SSP
          performs slightly different processing for the GRUU than
          it would for a URI without a "bnc" parameter.
          When the GRUU is re-targeted
          to the registered bulk number contact, the SSP MUST
          copy the "sg" parameter from the GRUU to the new target.
          The SIP-PBX can then use this "sg" parameter to determine to which
          user agent the request should be routed. For example,
          the first line of an INVITE request that has been re-targeted
          to the SIP-PBX for the UA shown above would look like this:
          <figure> <artwork>
INVITE sip:+12145550102@198.51.100.3;sg=00:05:03:5e:70:a6 SIP/2.0
          </artwork></figure>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Temporary GRUUs" anchor="temp-gruu">
        <t>
          In order to provide support for privacy, the SSP
          SHOULD implement the temporary GRUU
          mechanism described in this section. Reasons for
          not doing so would include systems with an
          alternative privacy mechanism that maintains
          the integrity of public GRUUs (i.e., if public
          GRUUs are anonymized, then the anonymizer
          function would need to be capable of providing -- as
          the anonymized URI -- a globally routable URI
          that routes back only to the target identified by
          the original public GRUU).
        </t>
        <t>
          Temporary GRUUs are used to provide anonymity
          for the party creating and sharing the GRUU.
          Being able to correlate two temporary GRUUs as
          having originated from behind the same SIP-PBX violates
          this principle of anonymity. Consequently, rather
          than relying upon a single, invariant identifier
          for the SIP-PBX in its UA's temporary GRUUs, we define
          a mechanism whereby the SSP provides the SIP-PBX with
          sufficient information for the SIP-PBX to mint unique
          temporary GRUUs. These GRUUs have the property that
          the SSP
          can correlate them to the proper SIP-PBX, but no other
          party can do so. To achieve this goal, we use a
          slight modification of the procedure described
          in Appendix A.2 of RFC 5627 <xref target="RFC5627"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          The SIP-PBX needs to be able to construct a temp-gruu in a way that
          the SSP can decode.
          In order to ensure that the SSP can decode GRUUs,
          we need to standardize the algorithm for creation
          of temp-gruus at the SIP-PBX.  This allows the SSP to
          reverse the algorithm in order to identify
          the registration entry that corresponds to the
          GRUU.
        </t>
        <t>
          It is equally important that no party other than
          the SSP be capable of decoding a temporary GRUU,
          including other SIP-PBXes serviced by the SSP.
          To achieve this property, an SSP that supports
          temporary GRUUs MUST create and store an asymmetric key
          pair: {K_e1,K_e2}. K_e1 is kept secret by the
          SSP, while K_e2 is shared with the SIP-PBXes via provisioning.
        </t>
        <t>
          All base64 encoding discussed in the following sections MUST 
          use the character set and encoding defined in
          Section 4 of RFC 4648 <xref target="RFC4648"/>, except that
          any trailing "=" characters are discarded on encoding
          and added as necessary to decode.
        </t>
        <t>
          The following sections make use of the term
          "HMAC-SHA256-80" to describe a particular Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC)
          algorithm.
          In this document, HMAC-SHA256-80 is defined as
          the application of the SHA-256 
          <xref target="FIPS.180-2.2008"/> secure hashing
          algorithm, truncating the results to 80 bits by discarding the
          trailing (least-significant) bits.

        <section title="Generation of &quot;temp-gruu-cookie&quot; by the SSP"
          anchor="ssp-tgc-gen">
          <t>
            An SSP that supports temporary GRUUs 
            MUST include a "temp-gruu-cookie"
            parameter on all "Contact" header fields containing a
            "bnc" parameter in a
            200-class REGISTER response. This "temp-gruu-cookie"
            MUST have the following properties:
          </t>
          <t>
            <list style="numbers">
              <t>
                It can be used by the SSP to uniquely identify
                the registration to which it corresponds.
              </t>
              <t>
                It is encoded using base64. This allows the
                SIP-PBX to decode it into as compact a form as
                possible for use in its calculations.
              </t>
              <t>
                It is of a fixed length. This allows for
                its extraction once the SIP-PBX has concatenated
                a distinguisher onto it.
              </t>
              <t>
                The temp-gruu-cookie MUST NOT be forgeable
                by any party. In other words, the SSP needs
                to be able to examine the cookie and validate
                that it was generated by the SSP.
              </t>
              <t>
                The temp-gruu-cookie MUST be invariant during
                the course of a registration, including any
                refreshes to that registration. This property
                is important, as it allows the SIP-PBX to
                examine the temp-gruu-cookie to determine
                whether the temp-gruus it has issued to its
                UAs are still valid.

            The above properties can be met using the following
            algorithm, which is non-normative. Implementors may
            chose to implement any algorithm of their choosing for
            generation of the temp-gruu-cookie, as
            long as it fulfills the five properties listed above.

            The registrar maintains a counter, I.&nbsp;
            This counter is 48 bits long and initialized to zero.
            This counter is persistently stored, using a
            back-end database or similar technique. When the
            registrar
            creates the first temporary GRUU for a particular SIP-PBX
            and instance ID (as defined by <xref target="RFC5627"/>),
            the registrar notes the current value
            of the counter, I_i, and increments the counter in the
            database.  The registrar then maps I_i to the 
            contact and
            instance ID using the database, a persistent hash-map,
            or similar technology.  If the registration expires
            such that there are no longer any contacts with that
            particular instance ID bound to the GRUU, the registrar
            removes the mapping.  Similarly, if the temporary GRUUs
            are invalidated due to a change in Call-ID, the registrar
            removes the current mapping from I_i to the AOR and
            instance ID, notes the current value of the counter
            I_j, and stores a mapping from I_j to the 
            contact containing a "bnc" parameter and
            instance ID.  Based on these rules, the hash-map will
            contain a single mapping for each contact containing a
            "bnc" parameter and instance ID
            for which there is a currently valid registration.

            The registrar maintains a symmetric key SK_a,
            which is regenerated every time the counter rolls
            over or is reset. When the counter rolls over or is reset,
            the registrar remembers the old value of SK_a for
            a while. To generate a temp-gruu-cookie, the
            registrar computes:
          <figure> <artwork>

      SA = HMAC(SK_a, I_i)
      temp-gruu-cookie = base64enc(I_i || SA)

        <t>
          According to Section 3.2 of RFC 5627 <xref target="RFC5627"/>, 
          every registration refresh generates a new temp-gruu that
          is valid for as long as the contact remains registered.
          This property is both critical for the privacy properties
          of temp-gruu and is expected by UAs that implement the
          temp-gruu procedures. Nothing in this document should
          be construed as changing this fundamental temp-gruu
          property in any way. SIP-PBXes that implement
          temporary GRUUs MUST generate a new temp-gruu according
          to the procedures in this section for every registration
          or registration refresh from GRUU-supporting UAs 
          attached to the SIP-PBX.
        </t>
        <t>
          Similarly, if the registration that a SIP-PBX has with
          its SSP expires or is terminated, then the temp-gruu
          cookie it maintains with the SSP will change. This change
          will invalidate all the temp-gruus the SIP-PBX has issued
          to its UAs. If the SIP-PBX tracks this information
          (e.g., to include &lt;temp-gruu> elements in
          registration event bodies, as described in RFC 5628
          <xref target="RFC5628"/>), it can determine that
          previously issued temp-gruus are invalid by observing
          a change in the temp-gruu-cookie provided to it
          by the SSP.
        </t>
        <t>
          A SIP-PBX that issues temporary GRUUs to its UAs
          MUST maintain an HMAC key: PK_a. This value is used
          to validate that incoming GRUUs were generated by
          the SIP-PBX.
        </t>
        <t>
          To generate a new temporary GRUU for use by its own
          UAs, the SIP-PBX MUST generate a random distinguisher
          value: D.&nbsp; The length of this value is up to implementors,
          but it MUST be long enough to prevent collisions among
          all the temporary GRUUs issued by the SIP-PBX. A size of
          80 bits or longer is RECOMMENDED. See RFC 4086
          <xref target="RFC4086"/> for further considerations
          on the generation of random numbers in a security
          context. After generating the distinguisher D,
          the SIP-PBX MUST calculate:
          <figure> <artwork>

  M    = base64dec(SSP-cookie) || D
  E    = RSA-Encrypt(K_e2, M)
  PA   = HMAC(PK_a, E)

  Temp-Gruu-userpart = "tgruu." || base64(E) || "." || base64(PA)

          "HMAC" represents any suitably strong HMAC algorithm;

          HMAC algorithm for this purpose is HMAC-SHA256-80.
        </t>
        <t>
           Finally, the SIP-PBX adds a "gr" parameter to the temporary
           GRUU that can be used to uniquely identify the UA
           registration record to which the GRUU corresponds.
           The means of generation of the "gr" parameter are
           left to the implementor, as long as they satisfy
           the properties of a GRUU as described in 
           RFC 5627 <xref target="RFC5627"/>.

        <t><list style="hanging"><t>
           One valid approach for generation of the "gr"

            has rolled over or reset, this computation
            is performed with the current and previous
            SK_a.

        <section title="Decoding of temp-gruu by the SIP-PBX">
          <t>
            When the SIP-PBX receives a request in which the
            user part begins with "tgruu.", it extracts
            the remaining portion and splits it at the
            "." character into E' and PA'.
            It then computes E and PA by performing a base64
            decode of E' and PA', respectively. Next, it computes:
            <figure> <artwork>

  PAc = HMAC(PK_a, E)

            </artwork></figure>
            where HMAC is the HMAC algorithm used for the steps
            in <xref target="pbx-tg-gen"/>. If this computed value
            for PAc does not match the value of PA extracted
            from the GRUU, then the GRUU is rejected as
            invalid.
          </t>
          <t>
            The SIP-PBX then uses the value of the "gr" parameter
            to locate the UA registration to which the GRUU
            corresponds, and routes the message accordingly.

    <section title="Registration Event Package">
      <t>
        Neither the SSP nor the SIP-PBX is required to support
        the registration event package defined by
        RFC 3680 <xref target="RFC3680"/>. However, if they do
        support the registration event package, they MUST conform
        to the behavior described in this section and its subsections.
      </t>
      <t>
        As this mechanism inherently deals with REGISTER transaction behavior,
        it is imperative to consider its impact on the registration
        event package defined by RFC 3680 <xref target="RFC3680"/>.
        In practice, there will be two main use cases for subscribing
        to registration data: learning about the overall registration
        state for the SIP-PBX and learning about the registration state
        for a single SIP-PBX AOR.
      </t>
      <section title="SIP-PBX Aggregate Registration State" 
       anchor="pbx-reg-event">
        <t>
          If the SIP-PBX (or another interested and authorized party)
          wishes to monitor or audit the registration state for
          all of the AORs currently registered to that SIP-PBX,
          it can subscribe to the SIP registration event package
          at the SIP-PBX's main URI -- that is, the URI used in
          the "To" header field of the REGISTER request.
        </t>
        <t>
          The NOTIFY messages for such a subscription will contain
          a body that contains one record for each AOR
          associated with the SIP-PBX. The AORs will be in the format
          expected to be received by the SSP (e.g., 
          "sip:+12145550105@ssp.example.com"), and the contacts
          will correspond to the mapped contact created by the
          registration (e.g., "sip:+12145550105@98.51.100.3").
        </t>
        <t>
          In particular, the "bnc" parameter is forbidden from
          appearing in the body of a reg-event NOTIFY request unless
          the subscriber has indicated knowledge of the semantics
          of the "bnc" parameter. The means for indicating this
          support are out of scope of this document.
        </t>
        <t>
          Because the SSP does not necessarily know which
          GRUUs have been issued by the SIP-PBX to its associated UAs,
          these records will not generally contain the &lt;temp-gruu>
          or &lt;pub-gruu> elements defined in RFC 5628 
          <xref target="RFC5628"/>. This information can be
          learned, if necessary, by subscribing to the individual
          AOR registration state, as described in
          <xref target="reg-UA"/>.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Individual AOR Registration State"
        anchor="reg-UA">
        <!-- 7.2.2 -->
        <t>
          As described in <xref target="ssp-processing"/>, the
          SSP will generally re-target all requests addressed to
          an AOR owned by a SIP-PBX to that SIP-PBX according
          to the mapping established at registration time.
          Although policy at the SSP may override this generally
          expected behavior, proper behavior of the registration
          event package requires that all "reg" event SUBSCRIBE
          requests are processed by the SIP-PBX. As a consequence,
          the requirements on an SSP for processing registration
          event package SUBSCRIBE requests are not left to policy.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the SSP receives a SUBSCRIBE request for the registration
          event package with a Request URI that indicates an
          AOR registered via the "Bulk Number Contact" mechanism
          defined in this document, then the SSP MUST proxy that SUBSCRIBE
          to the SIP-PBX in the same way that it would proxy an INVITE
          bound for that AOR, unless the SSP has and can maintain
          a copy of complete, accurate, and up-to-date information
          from the SIP-PBX (e.g., through an active back-end
          subscription).
        </t>
        <t>
          If the Request URI in a SUBSCRIBE request for the
          registration event package indicates a contact that
          is registered by more than one SIP-PBX, then the SSP
          proxy will fork the SUBSCRIBE request to all the applicable
          SIP-PBXes. Similarly, if the Request URI corresponds
          to a contact that is both implicitly registered by
          a SIP-PBX and explicitly registered directly with the
          SSP proxy, then the SSP proxy will semantically fork the
          SUBSCRIBE request to the applicable SIP-PBX or SIP-PBXes and to
          the registrar function (which will respond with registration
          data corresponding to the explicit registrations at the
          SSP). The forking in both of these cases can be
          avoided if the SSP has and can maintain a copy of
          up-to-date information from the PBXes.
        </t>
        <t>
          Section 4.9 of RFC 3680 <xref target="RFC3680"/> indicates that
          "a subscriber MUST NOT create multiple dialogs as a result of a 
          single [registration event] subscription request".  Consequently,
          subscribers who are not aware of the extension described by
          this document will accept only one dialog in response to 
          such requests. In the case described in the preceding paragraph,
          this behavior will result in such clients receiving
          accurate but incomplete information about the registration
          state of an AOR. As an explicit change to the normative behavior 
          of RFC 3680, this document stipulates that subscribers to the 
          registration event package MAY create multiple dialogs as the 
          result of a single subscription request. This will allow subscribers
          to create a complete view of an AOR's registration state.
        </t>
        <t>
          Defining the behavior as described above is important, since
          the reg-event subscriber is interested in finding out
          about the comprehensive list of devices associated with
          the AOR. Only the SIP-PBX will have authoritative
          access to this information.  For example, if the user has
          registered multiple UAs with differing capabilities,
          the SSP will not know about the devices or their capabilities.
          By contrast, the SIP-PBX will.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the SIP-PBX is not registered with the
          SSP when a registration event subscription for a contact
          that would be implicitly registered if the SIP-PBX were
          registered is received, then the SSP SHOULD accept the subscription
          and indicate that the user is not currently registered.
          Once the associated SIP-PBX is registered, the SSP
          SHOULD use the subscription migration mechanism defined
          in RFC 3265 <xref target="RFC3265"/> to migrate the
          subscription to the SIP-PBX.
        </t>
        <t>
          When a SIP-PBX <!-- making use of the bulk registration
          approach described in this document --> receives a
          registration event subscription addressed to an AOR that
          has been registered <!-- with an SSP --> using the bulk
          registration mechanism described in this document, then
          each resulting registration information document
          SHOULD contain an 'aor' attribute in its
          &lt;registration/> element that corresponds to the
          AOR at the SSP. 
        </t>
        <t><list style="hanging"><t>
          For example, consider a SIP-PBX that has registered
          with an SSP that has a domain of "ssp.example.com". The
          SIP-PBX used a Contact URI of "sip:198.51.100.3:5060;bnc". 
          After such registration is complete,
          a registration event subscription arriving at the SSP
          with a Request URI of "sip:+12145550102@ssp.example.com"
          will be re-targeted to the SIP-PBX, with a
          Request URI of "sip:+12145550102@198.51.100.3:5060".
          The resulting registration document created by the
          SIP-PBX would contain
          a &lt;registration/> element with an "aor" attribute
          of "sip:+12145550102@ssp.example.com".
        </t></list></t>
        <t><list style="hanging"><t>
          This behavior ensures that subscribers
          external to the system (and unaware of GIN (generate implicit numbers) procedures)
          will be able to find the relevant information in the
          registration document (since they will be looking
          for the publicly visible AOR, not the address
          used for sending information from the SSP to the
          SIP-PBX).

        <t>
          A SIP-PBX that supports both GRUU procedures and

    <section title="Client-Initiated (Outbound) Connections"
      anchor="outbound">
      <t>
        RFC 5626 <xref target="RFC5626"/> defines a mechanism
        that allows UAs to establish long-lived TCP connections
        or UDP associations with a proxy in a way that allows
        bidirectional traffic between the proxy and the UA.
        This behavior is particularly important in the presence
        of NATs, and whenever TLS <xref target="RFC5246"/> security is required.
        Neither the SSP nor the SIP-PBX is required to support
        client-initiated connections.
      </t>
      <t>
        Generally, the outbound mechanism works with the
        solution defined in this document, without any modifications.
        Implementors should note that the instance ID used
        between the SIP-PBX and the SSP's registrar identifies
        the SIP-PBX itself, and not any of the UAs registered with
        the SIP-PBX. As a consequence, any attempts to use
        caller preferences
        (defined in RFC 3841 <xref target="RFC3841"/>)
        to target a specific instance are likely to fail. This
        shouldn't be an issue, as the preferred mechanism for
        targeting specific instances of a user agent is GRUU
        (see <xref target="gruu"/>).
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Non-Adjacent Contact Registration (Path) and Service-Route Discovery" anchor="path">
      <t>
        RFC 3327 <xref target="RFC3327"/> defines a means by which
        a registrar and its associated proxy can be informed of a
        route that is to be used between the proxy and the registered
        user agent. The scope of the route created by a "Path" header
        field is contact specific; if an AOR has multiple contacts
        associated with it, the routes associated with each contact
        may be different from each other. Support for non-adjacent
        contact registration is required in all SSPs and SIP-PBXes
        implementing the multiple-AOR-registration protocol
        described in this document.
      </t>
      <t>
        At registration time, any proxies between the user agent and
        the registrar may add themselves to the "Path" header field. By doing so,
        they request that any requests destined to the user agent
        as a result of the associated registration include them
        as part of the Route towards the user agent. Although the
        path mechanism does deliver the final path value to the
        registering UA, UAs typically ignore the value of the path.
      </t>
      <t>
        To provide similar functionality in the opposite direction --
        that is, to establish a route for requests sent by a registering
        UA -- RFC 3608 <xref target="RFC3608"/> defines a means
        by which a UA can be informed of a route that is to be used by
        the UA to route all outbound requests associated with the
        AOR used in the registration. This information is scoped to the
        AOR within the UA, and is not specific to the contact (or contacts)
        in the REGISTER request. 
        Support of service route discovery is OPTIONAL in SSPs and SIP-PBXes.
      </t>
      <t>
        The registrar unilaterally generates the values of the service
        route using whatever local policy it wishes to apply. Although it
        is common to use the "Path" and/or "Route" header field information in the request
        in composing the service route, registrar behavior is not constrained
        in any way that requires it to do so.
      </t>
      <t>
        In considering the interaction between these mechanisms and the
        registration of multiple AORs in a single request, implementors
        of proxies, registrars, and intermediaries must keep in mind
        the following issues, which stem from the fact that GIN effectively
        registers multiple AORs and multiple contacts. 
      </t>
      <t>
        First, all location service records that result from expanding a
        single Contact URI containing a "bnc" parameter will necessarily share
        a single path. Proxies
        will be unable to make policy decisions on a contact-by-contact
        basis regarding whether to include themselves in the path. Second,
        and similarly, all AORs on the SIP-PBX that are registered with a
        common REGISTER request will be forced to share a common
        service route.
      </t>
      <t>
        One interesting technique that the path and service route mechanisms enable
        is the inclusion of a token or cookie in the user portion of the
        service route or path entries. This token or cookie may convey
        information to proxies about the identity, capabilities, and/or
        policies associated with the user. Since this information will
        be shared among several AORs and several contacts when multiple
        AOR registration is employed, care should be taken to ensure that
        doing so is acceptable for all AORs and all contacts registered
        in a single REGISTER request.

      Note that the following examples elide any steps related to

  <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
    <t>
      The change proposed for the mechanism described
      in this document takes the unprecedented step
      of extending the previously defined REGISTER
      method to apply to more than one AOR. In general,
      this kind of change has the potential to cause
      problems at intermediaries -- such as proxies --
      that are party to the REGISTER transaction. In
      particular, such intermediaries may attempt to
      apply policy to the user indicated in the
      "To" header field (i.e., the SIP-PBX's identity),
      without any knowledge of the multiple AORs
      that are being implicitly registered.
    </t>
    <t>
      The mechanism defined by this document solves
      this issue by adding an option tag to a
      "Proxy-Require" header field in such REGISTER requests.
      Proxies that are unaware of this mechanism will
      not process the requests, preventing them from
      misapplying policy. Proxies that process
      requests with this option tag are clearly aware
      of the nature of the REGISTER request and can
      make reasonable policy decisions.
    </t>
    <t>
      As noted in <xref target="path"/>, intermediaries
      need to take care if they use a policy token in the path
      and service route mechanisms, as doing so will cause
      them to apply the same policy to all users serviced
      by the same SIP-PBX. This may frequently be the correct
      behavior, but circumstances can arise in which
      differentiation of user policy is required.
    </t>
    <t>
      <xref target="path"/> also notes that these techniques 
      use a token or cookie in the "Path" and/or "Service-Route"
      header values, and that this value will be shared among all
      AORs associated with a single registration. Because
      this information will be visible to user agents under
      certain conditions, proxy designers using this mechanism
      in conjunction with the techniques described in this
      document need to take care that doing so does not
      leak sensitive information.
    </t>
    <t>
      One of the key properties of the outbound client connection
      mechanism discussed in <xref target="outbound"/> is the assurance
      that a single connection is associated with a single user
      and cannot be hijacked by other users. With the mechanism
      defined in this document, such connections necessarily
      become shared between users. However, the only entity
      in a position to hijack calls as a consequence is the
      SIP-PBX itself. Because the SIP-PBX acts as a registrar
      for all the potentially affected users, it already has
      the ability to redirect any such communications as it
      sees fit. In other words, the SIP-PBX must be trusted
      to handle calls in an appropriate fashion, and the use of
      the outbound connection mechanism introduces no
      additional vulnerabilities.
    </t>
    <t>
      The ability to learn the identity and registration
      state of every user on the PBX (as described in 
      <xref target="pbx-reg-event"/>) is invaluable for
      diagnostic and administrative purposes. For example,
      this allows the SIP-PBX to determine whether all  
      its extensions are properly registered with the SSP.
      However, this information can also be highly sensitive,
      as many organizations may not wish to make their entire
      list of phone numbers available to external entities.
      Consequently, SSP servers are advised to use explicit
      (i.e., white-list) and configurable policies regarding
      who can access this information, with very conservative
      defaults (e.g., an empty access list or an access list
      consisting only of the PBX itself).
    </t>
    <t>
      The procedure for the generation of temporary GRUUs requires the
      use of an HMAC to detect any tampering that external entities
      may attempt to perform on the contents of a temporary GRUU.
      The mention of HMAC-SHA256-80 in <xref target="temp-gruu"/>
      is intended solely as an example of a suitable HMAC algorithm.
      Since all HMACs used in this document are generated and
      consumed by the same entity, the choice of an actual HMAC
      algorithm is entirely up to an implementation, provided that
      the cryptographic properties are sufficient to prevent third
      parties from spoofing GRUU-related information.
    </t>
    <t>
      The procedure for the generation of temporary GRUUs
      also requires the use of RSA keys. The selection of
      the proper key length for such keys requires
      careful analysis, taking into consideration the
      current and foreseeable speed of processing for
      the period of time during which GRUUs must remain
      anonymous, as well as emerging cryptographic
      analysis methods. The most recent guidance from
      RSA Laboratories <xref target="rsa-key-length"/>
      suggests a key length of 2048 bits for data that
      needs protection through the year 2030, and a
      length of 3072 bits thereafter.
    </t>
    <t>
      Similarly, implementors are warned to take
      precautionary measures to prevent unauthorized
      disclosure of the private key used in GRUU generation.
      Any such disclosure would result in the ability
      to correlate temporary GRUUs to each other and,
      potentially, to their associated PBXes.
    </t>
    <t>
      Further, the use of RSA decryption when processing
      GRUUs received from arbitrary parties can be exploited
      by Denial-of-Service (DoS) attackers to amplify the impact of an attack:
      because of the presence of a cryptographic operation
      in the processing of such messages, the CPU load may
      be marginally higher when the attacker uses (valid or
      invalid) temporary GRUUs in the messages employed by
      such an attack. Normal DoS mitigation techniques,
      such as rate-limiting processing of received messages,
      should help to reduce the impact of this issue as well.
    </t>
    <t>
      Finally, good security practices should be followed
      regarding the duration an RSA key is used. For implementors,
      this means that systems MUST include an easy way to
      update the public key provided to the SIP-PBX. To avoid
      immediately invalidating all currently issued temporary
      GRUUs, the SSP servers SHOULD keep the retired RSA
      key around for a grace period before discarding it. If
      decryption fails based on the new RSA key, then the SSP
      server can attempt to use the retired key instead. By
      contrast, the SIP-PBXes MUST discard the retired public key
      immediately and exclusively use the new public key.

      The document "Requirements for Multiple Address of Record
      (AOR) Reachability Information in the Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP)" <xref target="RFC5947"/>
      contains a list of requirements and desired properties for a
      mechanism to register multiple AORs with a single SIP
      transaction.  This section evaluates those requirements against
      the mechanism described in this document.
    </t>
    <t>REQ1 - The mechanism MUST allow a SIP-PBX to enter into a trunking arrangement with an SSP whereby the two parties have agreed on a set of telephone numbers assigned to the SIP-PBX.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>The requirement is satisfied.</t></list></t>

    <t>REQ2 - The mechanism MUST allow a set of assigned telephone numbers to comprise E.164 numbers, which can be in contiguous ranges, discrete, or in any combination of the two.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>The requirement is satisfied. The Direct Inward Dialing (DID) numbers associated with a registration are established by bilateral agreement between the SSP and the SIP-PBX; they are not part of the mechanism described in this document.</t></list></t>



    <t>REQ3 - The mechanism MUST allow a SIP-PBX to register reachability information with its SSP, in order to enable the SSP to route to the SIP-PBX inbound requests targeted at assigned telephone numbers.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>The requirement is satisfied.</t></list></t>

    <t>REQ4 - The mechanism MUST allow UAs attached to a SIP-PBX to register
    with the SIP-PBX for AORs based on assigned telephone numbers, in
    order to receive requests targeted at those telephone numbers,
    without needing to involve the SSP in the registration process.</t>

    <t><list style='empty'><t>The requirement is satisfied; in the presumed architecture, SIP-PBX UAs register with the SIP-PBX and require no interaction with the SSP.</t></list></t>

    <t>REQ5 - The mechanism MUST allow a SIP-PBX to handle requests
    originating at its own UAs and targeted at its assigned telephone
    numbers, without routing those requests to the SSP.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>The requirement is satisfied; SIP-PBXes may recognize their own DID numbers and GRUUs, and perform on-SIP-PBX routing without sending the requests to the SSP.</t></list></t>

    <t>REQ6 - The mechanism MUST allow a SIP-PBX to receive requests to its assigned telephone numbers originating outside the SIP-PBX and arriving via the SSP, so that the SIP-PBX can route those requests onwards to its UAs, as it would for internal requests to those telephone numbers.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>The requirement is satisfied</t></list></t>

    <t>REQ7 - The mechanism MUST provide a means whereby a SIP-PBX knows which of its assigned telephone numbers an inbound request from its SSP is targeted at.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>The requirement is satisfied. For ordinary calls and calls using public GRUUs, the DID number is indicated in the user portion of the Request URI. For calls using Temp GRUUs constructed with the mechanism described in <xref target="temp-gruu"/>, the "gr" parameter provides a correlation token the SIP-PBX can use to identify to which UA the call should be routed.</t></list></t>

    <t>REQ8 - The mechanism MUST provide a means of avoiding problems due to one side using the mechanism and the other side not.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>The requirement is satisfied through the 'gin' option tag and the 'bnc' Contact URI parameter.</t></list></t>

    <t>REQ9 - The mechanism MUST observe SIP backwards compatibility principles.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>The requirement is satisfied through the 'gin' option tag.</t></list></t>

    <t>REQ10 - The mechanism MUST work in the presence of a sequence of
    intermediate SIP entities on the SIP-PBX-to-SSP interface (i.e.,
    between the SIP-PBX and the SSP's domain proxy), where those
    intermediate SIP entities indicated during registration a need to be
    on the path of inbound requests to the SIP-PBX.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>The requirement is satisfied through the use of the path mechanism defined in RFC 3327 <xref target="RFC3327"/> </t></list></t>

    <t>REQ11 - The mechanism MUST work when a SIP-PBX obtains its IP address dynamically.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>The requirement is satisfied by allowing the SIP-PBX to use an IP address in the Bulk Number Contact URI contained in a REGISTER "Contact" header field.</t></list></t>

    <t>REQ12 - The mechanism MUST work without requiring the SIP-PBX to have a domain name or the ability to publish its domain name in the DNS.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>The requirement is satisfied by allowing the SIP-PBX to use an IP address in the Bulk Number Contact URI contained in a REGISTER "Contact" header field.</t></list></t>

    <t>REQ13 - For a given SIP-PBX and its SSP, there MUST be no impact on other domains, which are expected to be able to use normal RFC 3263 procedures to route requests, including requests needing to be routed via the SSP in order to reach the SIP-PBX.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>The requirement is satisfied by allowing the domain name in the Request URI used by external entities to resolve to the SSP's servers via normal RFC 3263 resolution procedures.</t></list></t>

    <t>REQ14 - The mechanism MUST be able to operate over a transport that
    provides end-to-end integrity protection and confidentiality between
    the SIP-PBX and the SSP, e.g., using TLS as specified in 
    <xref target="RFC3261"/>.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>The requirement is satisfied; nothing in the proposed mechanism prevents the use of TLS between the SSP and the SIP-PBX.</t></list></t>

    <t>REQ15 - The mechanism MUST support authentication of the SIP-PBX by
    the SSP and vice versa, e.g., using SIP digest authentication plus
    TLS server authentication as specified in <xref target="RFC3261"/>.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>The requirement is satisfied; SIP-PBXes may employ either SIP digest authentication or mutually authenticated TLS for authentication purposes.</t></list></t>

    <t>REQ16 - The mechanism MUST allow the SIP-PBX to provide its UAs with public or temporary Globally Routable UA URIs (GRUUs) <xref target="RFC5627"/>.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>The requirement is satisfied via the mechanisms detailed in <xref target="gruu"/>.</t></list></t>

    <t>REQ17 - The mechanism MUST work over any existing transport specified for SIP, including UDP.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>The requirement is satisfied to the extent that UDP can be used for REGISTER requests in general. The application of certain extensions and/or network topologies may exceed UDP MTU sizes, but such issues arise both with and without the mechanism described in this document. This document does not exacerbate such issues.</t></list></t>

    <t> REQ18 - Documentation MUST give guidance or warnings about how authorization policies may be affected by the mechanism, to address the problems described in Section 3.3 [of RFC 5947].</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>These issues are addressed at length in <xref target="security"/>, as well as summarized in <xref target="path"/>.</t></list></t>

    <t> REQ19 - The mechanism MUST be extensible to allow a set of assigned telephone numbers to comprise local numbers as specified in RFC 3966 <xref target="RFC3966"/>, which can be in contiguous ranges, discrete, or in any combination of the two.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>Assignment of telephone numbers to a registration is performed by the SSP's registrar, which is not precluded from assigning local numbers in any combination it desires.</t></list></t>

    <t>REQ20 - The mechanism MUST be extensible to allow a set of arbitrarily assigned SIP URI's as specified in RFC 3261 <xref target="RFC3261"/>, as opposed to just telephone numbers, without requiring a complete change of mechanism as compared to that used for telephone numbers.  </t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>The mechanism is extensible in such a fashion, as demonstrated by the document "GIN with Literal AoRs for SIP in SSPs (GLASS)" <xref target="I-D.kaplan-martini-glass"/>.</t></list></t>

    <t>DES1 - The mechanism SHOULD allow an SSP to exploit its mechanisms for providing SIP service to normal UAs in order to provide a SIP trunking service to SIP-PBXes.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>The desired property is satisfied; the routing mechanism described in this document is identical to the routing performed for singly registered AORs.</t></list></t>

    <t>DES2 - The mechanism SHOULD scale to SIP-PBXes of several thousand assigned telephone numbers.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>The desired property is satisfied; nothing in this document precludes DID number pools of arbitrary size.</t></list></t>

    <t>DES3 - The mechanism SHOULD scale to support several thousand SIP-PBX's on a single SSP.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>The desired property is satisfied; nothing in this document precludes an arbitrary number of SIP-PBXes from attaching to a single SSP.</t></list></t>
