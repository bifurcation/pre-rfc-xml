    <abstract>
      <t>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) defines a domain-level
        authentication framework for email to permit verification of the
        source and contents of messages. This document specifies an adjunct
        mechanism to aid in assessing messages that do not contain a DKIM
        signature for the domain used in the author's address. It defines a
        record that can advertise whether a domain signs its outgoing
        mail as well as how other hosts can access that record. </t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) defines a mechanism by which email
        messages can be cryptographically signed, permitting a signing domain
        to claim responsibility for the introduction of a message into the
        mail stream. Message recipients can verify the signature by querying
        the Signer's domain directly to retrieve the appropriate public key,
        and thereby confirm that the message was attested to by a party in
        possession of the private key for the signing domain.</t>

      <t>However, the legacy of the Internet is such that not all messages
        will be signed, and the absence of a signature on a message is not an
        a priori indication of forgery. In fact, during early phases of
        deployment, it is very likely that most messages will remain unsigned.
        However, some domains might decide to sign all of their outgoing mail,
        for example, to protect their brand names. It might be
	desirable for such
        domains to be able to advertise that fact to other hosts. This is the
        topic of Author Domain Signing Practices (ADSP).</t>

      <t>Hosts implementing this specification can inquire what Author Domain
	Signing
        Practices a domain advertises. This inquiry is called an Author
        Domain Signing Practices check.</t>

      <t>The basic requirements for ADSP are given in <xref target="RFC5016"
         />. This document refers extensively to <xref target="RFC4871" /> and
        assumes the reader is familiar with it.</t>

    <section title="Language and Terminology">

      <section title="Terms Imported from the DKIM Signatures Specification">

        <t>Some terminology used herein is derived directly from <xref
            target="RFC4871" />. In several cases, references in that document
          to "Sender" have been changed to "Author" here, to emphasize the
          relationship to the Author address(es) in the From: header field
          described in <xref target="RFC5322" />. Briefly, <list
            style="symbols">

            <t>A "Signer" is the agent that signs a message, as defined in
              Section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC4871" />.</t>

            <t>A "Local-part" is the part of an address preceding the @ character,
              as defined in <xref target="RFC5322" /> and used in <xref
                target="RFC4871" />.</t>
          </list></t>

      </section>
      <section title="Valid Signature">

        <t>A "Valid Signature" is any signature on a message that correctly
          verifies using the procedure described in Section 6.1 of <xref
            target="RFC4871" />.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Author Address">

        <t>An "Author Address" is an email address in the From: header field of
          a message <xref target="RFC5322" />. If the From: header field
          contains multiple addresses, the message has multiple Author
          Addresses.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Author Domain">

        <t>An "Author Domain" is everything to the right of the "@" in an
          Author Address (excluding the "@" itself).</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Alleged Author">

        <t>An "Alleged Author" is an Author Address of a message; it is
          "alleged" because it has not yet been checked.</t>

      </section>
      <section title="Author Domain Signing Practices">

        <t>"Author Domain Signing Practices" (or just "practices") consist of
          a machine-readable record published by the domain of an Alleged
          Author that includes statements about the domain's practices with
          respect to mail it sends with its domain in the From: line.</t>

      </section>
      <section title="Author Domain Signature">

        <t>An "Author Domain Signature" is a Valid Signature in which
	  the domain name of the DKIM signing entity, i.e.,
	  the d= tag in the DKIM-Signature header field,
	  is the same as the domain name in the Author Address.
	  Following <xref target="RFC5321" />, 
	  domain name comparisons are case insensitive.</t>

        <t>For example, if the From: line address is bob@domain.example,
	  and the message has a Valid Signature with the
          DKIM-Signature header field containing <spanx style="verb"
            >d=domain.example</spanx>, then the message has an Author
	  Domain Signature.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Operation Overview">

      <t>Domain owners publish ADSP information via a query mechanism such
        as the Domain Name System; specific details are given in <xref
          target="dnsrep" />.</t>

      <t>Hosts can look up the ADSP information of the domain(s) specified by
        the Author Address(es) as described in <xref target="Lookup" />. If a
        message has multiple Author Addresses, the ADSP lookups SHOULD be
        performed independently on each address. This document does not
        address the process a host might use to combine the lookup
        results. </t>

      <section anchor="applicability" title="ADSP Applicability">
 <t>ADSP as defined in this document is bound to DNS.  For this reason, ADSP
is applicable only to Author Domains with appropriate DNS records (i.e.,
A, AAAA, and/or MX) indicating the possible use of the domain for email.
          The handling of other Author Domains is
          outside the scope of this document. However, attackers may use such
          domain names in a deliberate attempt to sidestep an organization's
          ADSP policy statements. It is up to the ADSP checker implementation
          to return an appropriate error result for Author Domains outside the
          scope of ADSP.</t>

	<t>ADSP applies to specific domains, not domain subtrees.
	  If, for example, an Author Address were user@domain.example, the
	  Author Domain would be domain.example, and the applicable ADSP
	  record would be at _adsp._domainkey.domain.example.
	  An Author Address in a subdomain such as user@sub.domain.example
	  would have a different ADSP record at
	  _adsp._domainkey.sub.domain.example.
	  ADSP makes no connection between a domain and its parent or
	  child domains.
	  
	  <list style="hanging" hangIndent="8">
	    <t hangText="Note:">If an organization wants
	      to publish Author Domain Signing
	      Practices for all the subdomains it uses, such as host names
	      of servers within the domain, it does so by creating ADSP
	      records for every _adsp._domainkey.&lt;sub&gt;.domain.example.
	      Wildcards cannot be used (see <xref target="wildcards" />.);
	      however, suitable DNS management tools
	      could automate creation of the ADSP records.</t>

            <t hangText="Note:">The results from DNS queries that are
              intended to validate a domain name unavoidably approximate
              the set of Author Domains that can appear in legitimate email.
              For example, a DNS A record could belong to a device that does
              not even have an email implementation. It is up to the checker
              to decide what degree of approximation is acceptable.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
      <section title="ADSP Usage" anchor="usage">

        <t>Depending on the Author Domain(s) and the signatures in a message,
          a recipient gets varying amounts of useful information from each
          ADSP lookup. <list style="symbols">

            <t>If a message has no Valid Signature, the ADSP result is
              directly relevant to the message.</t>

            <t>If a message has an Author Domain Signature, ADSP
              provides no benefit relative to that domain since the message is
              already known to be compliant with any possible ADSP for that
              domain.</t>

            <t>If a message has a Valid Signature other than an
              Author Domain Signature, the receiver can use both the Signature and the
              ADSP result in its evaluation of the message.</t>

          </list></t>
      </section>



      <section title="ADSP Results">

        <t>An ADSP lookup for an Author Address produces one of four possible
          results: <list style="symbols">

            <t>Messages from this domain might or might not have an Author
              Domain Signature. This is the default if the domain exists in the DNS
              but no ADSP record is found.</t>

            <t>All messages from this domain are signed with
	      an Author Domain Signature.</t>

            <t>All messages from this domain are signed with an Author
	      Domain Signature and are discardable, i.e., if a message
	      arrives without a valid Author Domain Signature,
	      the domain encourages the recipient(s) to discard it.</t>

            <t>This domain is out of scope, i.e., the domain does not
	      exist in the DNS.</t>
          </list></t>
	<t>An ADSP lookup could terminate without producing any result if
	a DNS lookup results in a temporary failure.</t>

    <section title="Detailed Description">

      <section anchor="dnsrep" title="DNS Representation">

        <t>ADSP records are published using the DNS TXT resource record type.</t>


        <t>The RDATA for ADSP resource records is textual in format, with
          specific syntax and semantics relating to their role in describing
          ADSP. The "Tag=Value List" syntax described in Section 3.2 of <xref
            target="RFC4871" /> is used, modified to use whitespace
          (WSP) rather than folding whitespace (FWS). Records not in compliance with that
          syntax or the syntax of individual tags described in
          <xref target="Lookup" /> MUST be ignored (considered equivalent to a NODATA result) for
          purposes of ADSP, although they MAY cause the logging of warning
          messages via an appropriate system logging mechanism. If the RDATA
          contains multiple character strings, the strings are logically
          concatenated with no delimiters between the strings. 
	  <list style="hanging" hangIndent="8">
            <t hangText="Note:"> ADSP changes the "Tag=Value List" syntax
	      from  <xref target="RFC4871" /> to use WSP rather than FWS
	      in its DNS records.</t>
	</list></t>

       <t>Domains MUST NOT publish ADSP records with wildcard names.
      Wildcards within a domain publishing ADSP records pose a particular

	  Every ADSP record MUST start with an outbound signing-practices

          <t>Tags used in ADSP records are described below. Unrecognized tags

        <t>Hosts doing an ADSP lookup MUST produce a result that is

            implementations SHOULD avoid doing unnecessary DNS lookups.</t>

        <t>For the purposes of this section, a "valid ADSP record" is one that

	      An ADSP checker implementation MUST determine whether a given Author Domain is

              outside the scope of ADSP.</t>

            <t>The host MUST
              perform a DNS query for a record corresponding to the Author
              Domain (with no prefix). The type of the query can be of any type,
              since this step is only to determine if the domain itself exists
              in DNS. This query MAY be done in parallel with the query to
              fetch the named ADSP Record. If the result of this query is that
	      the Author Domain does not exist in the DNS (often called an
	      NXDOMAIN error, rcode=3 in <xref target="RFC1035" />), the algorithm
	      MUST terminate with an error indicating that the domain is
	      out of scope.
	      Note that a result with rcode=0 but no records
	      (often called NODATA)
	      is not the same as NXDOMAIN.

                DISCUSSION: Any resource record type
                could be used for this query since the existence of a
                resource record of any type will prevent an
                NXDOMAIN error. 
                MX is a reasonable choice for
                this purpose because this record type is thought to
                be the most common for domains used in email, and will
                therefore produce a result that can be more readily
                cached than a negative result.</t>
              </list></t>
	    <t>If the domain does exist,
	      the checker MAY make more extensive checks to verify the
	      existence of the domain, such as the ones described in
	      Section 5 of <xref target="RFC5321" />.
	      If those checks indicate that the Author Domain does not exist
	      for mail, e.g., the domain has no MX, A, or AAAA record,
	      the checker SHOULD terminate with an error
	      indicating that the domain is out of scope.

    <section title="Security Considerations">

      <t>Security considerations in the ADSP are mostly related to attempts on
        the part of malicious senders to represent themselves as Authors for
        whom they are not authorized to send mail, often in an attempt to
        defraud either the recipient or an Alleged Author.</t>

      <t>Additional security considerations regarding Author Domain Signing
        Practices are found in <xref target="RFC4686">the DKIM threat
        analysis</xref>.</t>
      <section title="ADSP Threat Model">

        <t>Email recipients often have a core set of content Authors that they
          already trust. Common examples include financial institutions with
          which they have an existing relationship and Internet web
          transaction sites with which they conduct business.</t>

        <t>Email abuse often seeks to exploit a legitimate email Author's
	  name-recognition among recipients by using the Author's
          domain name in the From: header field. Especially since many popular
          Mail User Agents (MUAs) do not display the Author's email address, there is no
          empirical evidence of the extent that this particular unauthorized
          use of a domain name contributes to recipient deception or that
          eliminating it will have significant effect.</t>

        <t>However, closing this potential exploit could facilitate some types of
          optimized processing by receive-side message filtering engines,
          since it could permit them to maintain higher-confidence assertions
          about From: header field uses of a domain when the occurrence is
          authorized.</t>

        <t>Unauthorized uses of domain names occur elsewhere in messages, as
          do unauthorized uses of organizations' names. These attacks are
          outside the scope of this specification.</t>

        <t>ADSP does not provide any benefit -- nor, indeed, have any effect at
          all -- unless an external system acts upon the verdict, either by
          treating the message differently during the delivery process or by
          showing some indicator to the end recipient. Such a system is out of
          scope for this specification.</t>

        <t>ADSP checkers may perform multiple DNS lookups per Alleged Author
          Domain. Since these lookups are driven by domain names in email
          message headers of possibly fraudulent email, legitimate ADSP
          checkers can become participants in traffic multiplication
          attacks on domains that appear in fraudulent email.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="DNS Considerations">

        <t>An attacker might attack the DNS infrastructure in an attempt to
          impersonate ADSP records to influence a receiver's
          decision on how it will handle mail. However, such an attacker is
          more likely to attack at a higher level, e.g., redirecting A or MX
          record lookups in order to capture traffic that was legitimately
          intended for the target domain. These DNS security issues are
          addressed by <xref target="RFC4033">DNSSEC</xref>.</t>

        <t>Because ADSP operates within the framework of the legacy email
          system, the default result in the absence of an ADSP record is that
          the domain does not sign all of its messages. It is therefore
          important that the ADSP clients distinguish a DNS failure such as
            <spanx style="verb">SERVFAIL</spanx> from other DNS errors so that
          appropriate actions can be taken.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="wildcards" title="DNS Wildcards">

	<t>DNS wildcards (described in <xref target="RFC4592" />) that exist
	  in the DNS hierarchy at or above the domain being checked
	  interfere with the ability to verify the
	  scope of the ADSP check described in <xref target="Lookup" />.
	  For example, a
	  wildcard record for *.domain.example makes all subdomains
	  such as foo.domain.example exist in the DNS.
	  Domains that intend to make active use of ADSP by publishing
	  a practice other than unknown are advised
	  to avoid the use of wildcards in their hierarchy.</t>

        <t>If a domain contains wildcards, then any name that matches
	  the wildcard can appear to be a valid mail domain eligible for ADSP.
	  But the <spanx style="verb">_adsp._domainkey.</spanx> prefix
	  on ADSP records does not allow publication of wildcard records that
	  cover ADSP records without also covering non-ADSP records,
	  nor does it allow publication
	  of wildcard records that cover non-ADSP records without
	  also covering ADSP records.
	  A domain that uses ADSP practices other than unknown
	  SHOULD NOT publish wildcard records.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Inappropriate Application of Author Domain Signatures">
	<t>
	  In one model of DKIM usage, a domain signs messages that are
	  in transit through their system.  Since any signature whose
	  domain matches the Author Domain is, by definition, an Author
	  Domain Signature, it would be unwise to sign mail whose
	  Author Domain is the Signer's domain if the mail is not
	  known to meet the domain's standards for an Author Domain
	  Signature.</t>

	<t>One such use case is where a domain might apply such a
	  signature following application of an
	  Authentication-Results header field as described in Section
	  7.1 of <xref target="RFC5451" />.
	  This problem can be easily avoided either
	  by not applying a signature that might be confused with an
	  Author Domain Signature or by applying a signature from some
	  other domain, such as a subdomain of the Author Domain.

    <section title="Usage Examples">
      <t>These examples are intended to illustrate typical uses of ADSP. They
        are not intended to be exhaustive or to apply to every domain's or
        mail system's individual situation.</t>

      <t>Domain managers are advised to consider the ways that mail processing
        can modify messages in ways that will invalidate an existing DKIM
        signature, such as mailing lists, courtesy forwarders, and other paths
        that could add or modify headers, or modify the message body. 
        If the modifications invalidate the DKIM signature, recipient
        hosts will consider the mail not to have an Author Domain Signature, even
        though the signature was present when the mail was originally
        sent.</t>

      <section anchor="allexamp" title="Single Location Domains">
        <t>One common mail system configuration handles all of a domain's users'
          incoming and outgoing mail through a single Mail Transport Agent (MTA) or group of MTAs. With
          this configuration, the MTA(s) can be configured to sign outgoing mail with
          an Author Domain Signature.</t>

        <t>In this situation, it might be appropriate to publish an ADSP record
          for the domain containing "all", depending on whether the users also
          send mail through other paths that do not apply an Author Domain Signature.
          Such paths could include MTAs at hotels or hotspot networks used by
          travelling users, web sites that provide "mail an article"
	  features, user messages sent through mailing lists,
	  or third-party mail clients that support multiple user identities.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Bulk Mailing Domains">
        <t>Another common configuration uses a domain solely for bulk or
          broadcast mail, with no individual human users -- again, typically
          sending all the mail through a single MTA or group of MTAs that can
          apply an Author Domain Signature. In this case, the domain's management can
          be confident that all of its outgoing mail will be sent through the
          signing MTA(s). Lacking individual users, the domain is unlikely to
          participate in mailing lists, but could still send mail through
          other paths that might invalidate signatures.</t>

        <t>Domain owners often use specialist mailing providers to send their
          bulk mail. In this case, the mailing provider needs access to a
          suitable signing key in order to apply an Author Domain Signature. One
          possible route would be for the domain owner to generate the key and
          give it to the mailing provider. Another would be for the domain to
          delegate a subdomain to the mailing provider, for example,
          bigbank.example might delegate email.bigbank.example to such a
          provider; in this case, the provider can generate the keys and DKIM
          DNS records itself and use the subdomain in the Author Address in
          the mail.</t>

	<t>Regardless of the DNS and key management strategy chosen, whoever
	  maintains the DKIM records for the domain could also install an
	  ADSP record containing "all".</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Bulk Mailing Domains with Discardable Mail">
        <t>In some cases, a domain might sign all of its outgoing mail with an
Author Domain Signature and prefer that recipient systems discard mail
without a valid Author Domain Signature in order to avoid having its
mail confused with mail sent from sources that do not apply an
Author Domain Signature. (In the case of domains with tightly controlled outgoing mail,
	  this latter kind of mail is sometimes loosely called
          "forgeries".) In such cases, it might be appropriate to
	  publish an ADSP record containing "discardable". Note that a
	  domain SHOULD NOT publish a "discardable"
          record if it wishes to maximize the likelihood that mail from the
          domain is delivered, since it could cause some fraction of the mail
          the domain sends to be discarded.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Third-Party Senders">

        <t>Another common use case is for a third party to enter into an
          agreement whereby that third party will send bulk or other mail on
          behalf of a designated Author or Author Domain, using that domain in
          the <xref target="RFC5322" /> From: or other headers. Due to the many and varied
          complexities of such agreements, third-party signing is not
          addressed in this specification.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Domains with Independent Users and Liberal Use Policies">
	
	<t>When a domain has independent users and its usage policy
	  does not explicitly restrict them to sending mail only from
	  designated mail servers (e.g., many ISP domains and even some
	  corporate domains), then it is only appropriate to publish
	  an ADSP record containing "unknown". Publishing either "all"
	  or "discardable" will likely result in significant breakage
	  because independent users are likely to send mail from the
	  external paths enumerated in <xref target="allexamp" />.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Non-Email Domains">
        <t>If a domain sends no mail at all, it can safely
          publish a "discardable" ADSP record, since any mail with an Author
          Address in the domain is a forgery.</t>
