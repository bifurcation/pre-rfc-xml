This document describes an extension to the OSPF protocol to
add an optional operational capability that allows tagging and grouping of
the nodes in an OSPF domain. This allows simplification, ease of management and
control over route and path selection based on configured policies.
This document describes an extension to the OSPF protocol to advertise node 
administrative tags. The node tags can be used to express and apply locally defined
network policies, which are a very useful operational capability. Node tags
may be used by either OSPF
itself or other applications consuming information propagated via OSPF. </t>
<t>This document describes the protocol extensions to disseminate
node administrative tags to the OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 protocol. It provides example
 use cases of administrative node tags.</t>

<section title="Introduction" anchor='intro'>

<t> 
It is useful to assign a node administrative tag to a router in the OSPF domain and use
it as an attribute associated with the node. The node administrative tag can be used in
a variety of applications, for example:</t>
<t>
<list style="format (%c)" hangIndent="5">
    <t>Traffic Engineering (TE) applications to provide different path-selection criteria. </t>
    <t>Prefer or prune certain paths in Loop-Free Alternate (LFA) backup selection via
	local policies as defined in  <xref target="LFA-MANAGE"/>.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>This document provides mechanisms to advertise node administrative
tags in OSPF for route and path selection. Route and path selection functionality applies to
both TE and non-TE applications; hence, a new TLV for carrying node 
administrative tags is included in Router Information (RI) Link State Advertisement (LSA) <xref target="RFC7770"/>.
</t>

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
</section>

<section title='OSPF Node Admin Tag TLV'>
<t> An administrative tag is a 32-bit integer value that can be
used to identify a group of nodes in the OSPF domain.</t>
<t>
The newly defined TLV is carried within an RI LSA for OSPFV2 and
OSPFV3. RI LSA <xref target="RFC7770"/> can have flooding
scope at the link, area, or Autonomous System (AS) level. The choice of what scope at which to flood the group tags is
a matter of local policy. It is expected that node administrative tag values will
not be portable across administrative domains.
</t>
<t>
The TLV specifies one or more administrative tag values. An OSPF
node advertises the set of groups it is part of in the OSPF domain
(for example, all PE nodes are configured with a certain tag value,
and all P nodes are configured with a different tag value in the domain).
Multiple TLVs MAY be added in same RI LSA or
in a different instance of the RI LSA as defined in
<xref target="RFC7770"/>.
</t>

<section title='TLV Format'>
<t> <xref target="RFC7770"/> defines the RI LSA, which may be used to 
advertise properties of the originating router. The payload of the RI LSA consists of one or
more nested Type/Length/Value (TLV) triplets.
</t>
<t>
Node administrative tags are advertised in the Node Admin Tag TLV.
The format of the Node Admin Tag TLV is:

</section>
<section title='Elements of Procedure'>
<section title='Interpretation of Node Administrative Tags'>
<t>The meaning of the node administrative tags is generally
opaque to OSPF. Routers advertising the node
administrative tag (or tags) may be configured to do so
without knowing (or even without supporting processing of)
the functionality implied by the tag. This section describes general rules, regulations,
and guidelines for using and interpreting an administrative tag that will
 facilitate interoperable implementations by vendors. </t>
<t>Interpretation of tag values is specific to the administrative domain of a particular network operator; hence, tag values SHOULD NOT be propagated outside the administrative domain to which they apply.
The meaning of a node administrative tag is defined by the network local policy
and is controlled via the configuration. If a receiving node does not
understand the tag value or does not have a local policy corresponding to the tag,
it ignores the specific tag and floods the RI LSA without any change as defined in <xref target="RFC7770"/>. </t>
<t>The semantics of the tag order has no meaning.
That is, there is no implied meaning to the ordering of the
tags that indicates a certain operation or set of operations
that need to be performed based on the ordering.</t>
<t>Each tag must be treated as an independent
identifier that may be used in the policy to perform a policy
action. Each tag carried by the Node Admin Tag TLV should be used to
indicate a characteristic of a node that is independent of the
characteristics indicated by other administrative tags.
The administrative-tag list within the TLV MUST be considered 
an unordered list. While policies may be implemented based on the 
presence of multiple tags (e.g., if tag A AND tag B are present), 
they MUST NOT be reliant upon the order of the tags (i.e.,
all policies should be considered commutative operations, such that
tag A preceding or following tag B does not change their outcome).
</t>
</section>

<section title='Use of Node Administrative Tags'>
<t>The node administrative tags are not meant to be
extended by future OSPF standards. New OSPF
extensions are not expected to require use of node administrative
tags or define well-known tag values. Node administrative tags
are for generic use and do not require IANA registration.
Future OSPF extensions requiring well-known values MAY
define their own data signaling tailored to the needs of the
feature or MAY use the capability TLV as defined in
<xref target="RFC7770"/>. </t>
<t>Being part of the RI LSA, the Node Admin Tag
TLV must be reasonably small and stable. In particular,
implementations supporting node
administrative tags MUST NOT be used to convey attributes of the
routing topology or associate tags with 
changes in the network topology (both within and outside
the OSPF domain) or reachability of routes.</t>
</section>

<section title='Processing Node Administrative Tag Changes'>
<t> Multiple Node Admin Tag TLVs MAY appear in an RI LSA or 
   multiple Node Admin Tag TLVs MAY be contained in different
   instances of the RI LSA.  The administrative tags associated
   with a node that originates tags for the purpose of any computation or processing at a receiving node
   SHOULD be a superset of node administrative tags from all the TLVs in all the
   received RI LSA instances in the Link-State Database (LSDB) advertised by the 
   corresponding OSPF router. When an RI LSA is received that changes the set of 
   tags applicable to any originating node, which has features depending on node administrative tags,
   a receiving node MUST repeat any computation or
	processing that is based on those administrative tags.
</t>
<t>When there is a change or removal of an administrative affiliation of a node, 
   the node MUST re-originate the RI LSA with the latest set of node administrative tags.
   On the receiver, when there is a change in the Node Admin Tag TLV or
   removal/addition of a TLV in any instance of the RI LSA, implementations MUST
   take appropriate measures to update their state according to the
   changed set of tags. The exact actions needed depend on features working with
   administrative tags and are outside of scope of this specification.
</t>
</section>
</section>
</section>
<section title='Applications'>
<t>This section lists several examples of how implementations
might use the node administrative tags. These examples are

given only to demonstrate the generic usefulness of the router

tagging mechanism. Implementations supporting this

specification are not required to implement any of these use cases. It is also worth noting that in some described use
cases, routers configured to advertise tags help other routers
in their calculations but do not themselves implement the
same functionality.</t>
<section title='Service Auto-Discovery'>
<t>
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
Router tagging may be used to automatically discover a
group of routers sharing a particular service.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
For example, a service provider might desire to establish

a full mesh of MPLS TE tunnels between all PE routers in

the area of the MPLS VPN network. Marking all PE routers with
a tag and configuring devices with a policy to create
MPLS TE tunnels to all other devices advertising this tag
will automate maintenance of the full mesh. When a new PE
router is added to the area, all other PE devices will
open TE tunnels to it without needing to reconfigure
them.
</t>
</section>
<section title='Fast-Rerouting Policy'>
<t>
Increased deployment of Loop-Free Alternates (LFA) as
defined in <xref target="RFC5286"/> poses operation and
management challenges. <xref
target="LFA-MANAGE"/> proposes
policies which, when implemented, will ease LFA operation
concerns.</t>
<t>
One of the proposed refinements is to be able to group
the nodes in an IGP domain with administrative tags and
engineer the LFA based on configured policies.
<list style="format (%c)" hangIndent="4">
<t>Administrative limitation of LFA scope
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
Service provider access infrastructure is frequently
designed in a layered approach with each layer of
devices serving different purposes and thus having
different hardware capabilities and configured
software features. When LFA repair paths are being
computed, it may be desirable to exclude devices from
being considered as LFA candidates based on their
layer.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
For example, if the access infrastructure is divided
into the Access, Distribution, and Core layers, it may
be desirable for a Distribution device to compute LFA
only via Distribution or Core devices but not via
Access devices. This may be due to features enabled
on Access routers, due to capacity limitations, or due
to the security requirements. Managing such a policy
via configuration of the router computing LFA is
cumbersome and error prone.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
With the node administrative tags, it is possible to
assign a tag to each layer and implement LFA policy
of computing LFA repair paths only via neighbors
that advertise the Core or Distribution tag. This
requires minimal per-node configuration and the network
automatically adapts when new links or routers are
added.
</t>
<t>LFA calculation optimization
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
Calculation of LFA paths may require significant
resources of the router. One execution of Dijkstra's
algorithm is required for each neighbor eligible to
become the next hop of repair paths. Thus, a router with a
few hundred neighbors may need to execute the
algorithm hundreds of times before the best (or even
valid) repair path is found. Manually excluding from
the calculation neighbors that are known to provide
no valid LFA (such as single-connected routers) may
significantly reduce the number of Dijkstra algorithm
runs.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
LFA calculation policy may be configured so that
routers advertising certain tag values are excluded
from LFA calculation, even if they are otherwise
suitable.
</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>
<section title ='Controlling Remote LFA Tunnel Termination'>
<t>
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
<xref target="RFC7490"/> 
   defined a method of tunneling traffic to extend the basic  
   LFA coverage after connection failure of a link and defined an algorithm to
   find tunnel tail-end routers meeting the LFA requirement.
In most
cases, the proposed algorithm finds more than one candidate
tail-end router. In a real-life network, it may be desirable
to exclude some nodes from the list of candidates based
on the local policy. This may be either due to known
limitations of the node (the router does not accept the targeted
LDP sessions required to implement remote LFA tunneling)
or due to administrative requirements (for example, it
may be desirable to choose the tail-end router among
colocated devices).
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
The node administrative tag delivers a simple and scalable
solution. Remote LFA can be configured with a policy to
accept only routers advertising a certain tag as candidates 
during the tail-end router calculation. Tagging
routers allows both exclusion of nodes not capable of
serving as remote LFA tunnel tail ends and definition of a
region from which a tail-end router must be selected.
</t>

<section title='Mobile Backhaul Network Service Deployment'>
<t>
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
Mobile backhaul networks usually adopt a ring topology
to save fibre resources; it is usually divided into the aggregate network and
the access network. Cell Site Gateways (CSGs) connects the LTE Evolved NodeBs (eNodeBs) and
RNC (Radio Network Controller) Site Gateways (RSGs) connects the RNCs.
The mobile traffic is transported from CSGs to RSGs. The network takes
a typical aggregate traffic model that more than one access ring will
attach to one pair of aggregate site gateways (ASGs) and more than one
aggregate ring will attach to one pair of RSGs.

A typical mobile backhaul network with access rings and aggregate
links is shown in the figure above. The mobile backhaul networks deploy
traffic engineering due to strict Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
The TE paths may have additional constraints to avoid passing via different
access rings or to get completely disjoint backup TE paths. The mobile backhaul
networks towards the access side change frequently due to the growing mobile
traffic and addition of new eNodeBs. It's complex to satisfy the requirements
using cost, link color, or explicit path configurations.
The node administrative tag defined in this document can be effectively used
to solve the problem for mobile backhaul networks. The nodes in different rings
can be assigned with specific tags. TE path computation can be enhanced to
consider additional constraints based on node administrative tags. </t>
</section>
<section title='Explicit Routing Policy'>
<t>
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
A partially meshed network provides multiple paths between any two nodes in the network.
In a data centre environment, the topology is usually highly symmetric with many/all
paths having equal cost. In a long distance network, this is usually not the case, for
a variety of reasons (e.g., historic, fibre availability constraints, different distances
between transit nodes, and different roles). Hence, between a given source and destination,
a path is typically preferred over the others, while between the same source and another
destination, a different path may be preferred.

In the above topology, an operator may want to enforce the following high-level explicit routing policies:
<list style="symbols">
    <t>Traffic from A nodes to A nodes should preferably go through R or T
    nodes (rather than through I nodes);</t> 
    <t>Traffic from A nodes to I nodes must not go through R and T
    nodes.</t> 
</list>
With node admin tags, tag  A (resp.&nbsp;I, R, T) can be configured on all A (resp. I, R, T) nodes to advertise their role. 
The first policy is about preferring one path over another. Given the chosen metrics, it is achieved with regular SPF routing.
The second policy is about prohibiting (pruning) some paths. It requires an
explicit routing policy. With the use of node tags, this may be achieved with
a generic Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) policy configured on A nodes:
for destination nodes, having the tag "A" runs a CSPF with the exclusion of
nodes having the tag "I".

<section title='Security Considerations' anchor='sec-con'>
<t>
 Node administrative tags may be used by operators to indicate geographical location or other sensitive information.
 As indicated in <xref target="RFC2328"/> and <xref target="RFC5340"/>, OSPF authentication mechanisms do not provide 
 confidentiality and the information carried in node administrative tags could be leaked to an IGP snooper.
Confidentiality for the OSPF control packets can be achieved by either running OSPF on top of IP Security (IPsec) tunnels or 
by applying IPsec-based security mechanisms as described in <xref target="RFC4552"/>. </t>
 <t> Advertisement of tag values for one administrative domain into 
another  risks misinterpretation of the tag values (if the two domains have assigned 
different meanings to the same values), which may have undesirable and unanticipated side
effects.</t>
<t> <xref target="RFC4593"/> and <xref target="RFC6863"/> discuss the generic threats to routing protocols and OSPF, respectively.
These security threats are also applicable to the mechanisms described in this
document. OSPF authentication described in
<xref target="RFC2328"/> and <xref target="RFC5340"/> or extended authentication mechanisms described in <xref target="RFC7474"/>
or <xref target="RFC7166"/> SHOULD be used in deployments where attackers have access to the physical networks and nodes included in the 
 OSPF domain are vulnerable. </t>

</section>

<section title='Operational Considerations' anchor='op-con'>
<t>Operators can assign meaning to the node administrative tags, which are local to the operator's administrative domain.
The operational use of node administrative tags is analogical to the IS-IS prefix tags  <xref target="RFC5130"/> and
BGP communities <xref target="RFC1997"/>. Operational discipline and procedures followed in configuring and using BGP communities 
and IS-IS prefix tags is also applicable to the usage of node administrative tags.</t>
<t> Defining language for local policies is outside the scope of this
document. As is the case of other policy applications,
 the pruning policies  can cause the path to be completely removed from forwarding plane,
   and hence have the potential for more severe operational
   impact (e.g., node unreachability due to path removal) by comparison
   to preference policies that only affect path selection.
 </t>
 
</section>

<section title='Manageability Considerations' anchor='manage-con'>
<t>Node administrative tags are configured and managed using routing policy
enhancements. The YANG data definition language is the
latest model to describe and define configuration for network devices. The OSPF YANG data model is described in <xref target="OSPF-YANG"/>
and the routing policy configuration model is described in <xref target="RTG-POLICY"/>. These two documents will be
enhanced to include the configurations related to the node administrative tag.</t>

<abstract><t>Loop Free Alternates (LFA), as defined in RFC 5286 is an IP Fast ReRoute (IP FRR) mechanism enabling traffic protection for IP traffic (and MPLS LDP traffic by extension).  Following first deployment experiences, this document provides operational feedback on LFA, highlights some limitations, and proposes a set of refinements to address those limitations.  It also proposes required management specifications.  This proposal is also applicable to remote LFA solution.</t></abstract>
