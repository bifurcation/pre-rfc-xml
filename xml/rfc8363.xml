	<abstract><t>The International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   standardization sector (ITU-T) has extended its Recommendations
   G.694.1 and G.872 to include a new Dense Wavelength Division
   Multiplexing (DWDM) grid by defining channel spacings, a set of nominal
   central frequencies, and the concept of the "frequency
   slot".  Corresponding techniques for
	data-plane connections are known as "flexi-grid".</t>

	<t>
   Based on the characteristics of flexi-grid defined in G.694.1 and in RFCs
   7698 and 7699, this document describes the Open Shortest Path First - Traffic Engineering (OSPF-TE) extensions in
   support of GMPLS control of networks that include devices that use
   the new flexible optical grid.</t>

	<section title="Introduction" anchor="section-1"><t>
   <xref target="G.694.1"/> defines the Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM)
   frequency grids for Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)
   applications.  A frequency grid is a reference set of frequencies
   used to denote allowed nominal central frequencies that may be used
   for defining applications.  The channel spacing is the frequency
   spacing between two allowed nominal central frequencies.  All of the
   wavelengths on a fiber should use different central frequencies and
   occupy a fixed bandwidth of frequency.</t>

	<t>
   Fixed-grid channel spacing ranges from one of 12.5 GHz, 25 GHz, 50 GHz, or
   100 GHz to integer multiples of 100 GHz.  But <xref
   target="G.694.1"/> also defines a "flexible grid", also known as
   "flexi-grid".  The terms "frequency slot" (i.e., the frequency
   range allocated to a specific channel and unavailable to other
   channels within a flexible grid) and "slot width" (i.e., the full
   width of a frequency slot in a flexible grid) are used to define a
   flexible grid.</t>

	<t>
   <xref target="RFC7698"/> defines a framework and the associated control-plane
   requirements for the GMPLS-based control of flexi-grid DWDM networks.</t>

	<t>
   <xref target="RFC6163"/> provides a framework for GMPLS and Path Computation Element
   (PCE) control of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs).
   <xref target="RFC7688"/> defines the requirements and OSPF-TE extensions in support
   of GMPLS control of a WSON.</t>

	<t>
   <xref target="RFC7792"/> describes requirements and protocol extensions for
   signaling to set up Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in networks that support the flexi-grid.
   This document complements <xref target="RFC7792"/> by describing the requirement and
   extensions for OSPF-TE routing in a flexi-grid network.</t>

	<t>
   This document complements the efforts to provide extensions to the OSPF-TE protocol so as to
   support GMPLS control of flexi-grid networks.</t>

	<section title="Terminology" anchor="section-2"><t>
   For terminology related to flexi-grid, please consult <xref target="RFC7698"/> and
   <xref target="G.694.1"/>.</t>

	<section title="Requirements for Flexi-Grid Routing" anchor="section-3"><t>
   The architecture for establishing LSPs in a Spectrum Switched Optical
   Network (SSON) is described in <xref target="RFC7698"/>.</t>

	<t>
  A flexi-grid LSP occupies one or multiple specific frequency slots. 
  The process of computing a route and the allocation
  of a frequency slot is referred to as "RSA" (Routing and Spectrum
  Assignment).  <xref target="RFC7698"/> describes three types of architectural
   approaches to RSA: combined RSA, separated RSA, and routing and distributed SA.   The first two approaches could be called "centralized SA"
   because the spectrum (frequency slot) assignment is performed by a
   single entity before the signaling procedure.</t>

	<t>
   In the case of centralized SA, the assigned frequency slot is
   specified in the RSVP-TE Path message during the signaling process.
   In the case of routing and distributed SA, only the requested slot width of the
   flexi-grid LSP is specified in the Path message, allowing the
   involved network elements to select the frequency slot to be used.</t>

	<t>
   If the capability of switching or converting the whole optical
   spectrum allocated to an optical spectrum LSP is not available at
   nodes along the path of the LSP, the LSP is subject to the Optical
   "Spectrum Continuity Constraint", as described in <xref target="RFC7698"/>.</t>

	<t>
   The remainder of this section states the additional extensions on the
   routing protocols in a flexi-grid network.</t>

	<section title="Available Frequency Ranges" anchor="ranges"><t>
   In the case of flexi-grids, the central frequency steps from 193.1
   THz with 6.25 GHz granularity.  The calculation method of central
   frequency and the frequency slot width of a frequency slot are
   defined in <xref target="G.694.1"/>, i.e., by using nominal central frequency n and
   the slot width m.</t>

	<t>
   On a DWDM link, the allocated or in-use frequency slots do not
   overlap with each other.  However, the border frequencies of two
   frequency slots may be the same frequency, i.e., the upper bound of a
   frequency slot and the lower bound of the directly adjacent frequency
   slot are the same.</t>

	<figure title="Two Frequency Slots on a Link" anchor="fig1"><artwork><![CDATA[
                      Frequency Slot 1   Frequency Slot 2
                        +-----------+-----------------------+

                 Central F = 193.1 THz   Central F = 193.1375 THz
                  Slot width = 25 GHz    Slot width = 50 GHz
]]></artwork>
	</figure>
	<t>
   <xref target="fig1"/> shows two adjacent frequency slots on a link.  The highest
   frequency of frequency slot 1 denoted by n=2 is the lowest frequency
   of slot 2.  In this example, it means that the frequency range from
   n=-2 to n=10 is unavailable to other flexi-grid LSPs.  Available
   central frequencies are advertised for m=1, which means that for an
   available central frequency n, the frequency slot from central
   frequency n-1 to central frequency n+1 is available.</t>

	<t>
   Hence, in order to clearly show which frequency slots are available and can be used for LSP establishment and which
  frequency slots are unavailable, the availability of frequency slots is
  advertised by the routing protocol for the flexi-grid DWDM links.   A
   set of non-overlapping available frequency ranges is disseminated in
   order to allow efficient resource management of flexi-grid DWDM links
   and RSA procedures, which are described in Section 4.8 of <xref target="RFC7698"/>.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Application Compliance Considerations" anchor="compliance"><t>
   As described in <xref target="G.694.1"/>, devices or applications that make use of
   the flexi-grid may not be capable of supporting every possible slot
   width or position (i.e., central frequency).  In other words,
   applications or implementations may be defined where only a subset of
   the possible slot widths and positions are required to be supported.</t>

	<t>For example, an application could be defined where the nominal
   central frequency granularity is 12.5 GHz (by only requiring values
   of n that are even) and the same application only requires slot widths as a multiple
   of 25 GHz (by only requiring values of m that are even).

</t>

	<t>
   Hence, in order to support all possible applications and
   implementations, the following information SHOULD be advertised for a
   flexi-grid DWDM link:</t>

	<t><list style="symbols"><t>Channel Spacing (C.S.): as defined in <xref target="RFC7699"/> for flexi-grid, is
      set to 5 to denote 6.25 GHz.</t>

	<t>Central frequency granularity: a multiplier of C.S.</t>

	<t>Slot width granularity: a multiplier of 2*C.S.</t>

	<t>Slot width range: two multipliers of the slot width granularity,
      each indicating the minimal and maximal slot width supported by a
      port, respectively.</t>

	</list>
	</t>

	<t>
   The combination of slot width range and slot width granularity can be
   used to determine the slot widths set supported by a port.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Comparison with Fixed-Grid DWDM Links" anchor="section-3.3"><t>

   In the case of fixed-grid DWDM links, each wavelength has a
   predefined central frequency. Each wavelength maps to a predefined
   central frequency, and the usable frequency range is implicit by
   the channel spacing.  All the wavelengths on a DWDM link can be
   identified with an identifier that mainly conveys its central
   frequency as the label defined in <xref target="RFC6205"/>; the
   status of the wavelengths (available or not) can be advertised
   through a routing protocol.</t>

	<t>
   <xref target="fig2"/> shows a link that supports a fixed-grid with 50 GHz channel
   spacing.  The central frequencies of the wavelengths are predefined
   by values of "n", and each wavelength occupies a fixed 50 GHz
   frequency range as described in <xref target="G.694.1"/>.</t>

	<figure title="A Link Supports Fixed Wavelengths with 50 GHz Channel Spacing" anchor="fig2"><artwork><![CDATA[
     W(-2)  |    W(-1)  |    W(0)   |    W(1)   |     W(2)  |
...---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----...
      |   50 GHz  |  50 GHz   |  50 GHz   |   50 GHz  |

    n=-2        n=-1        n=0         n=1         n=2
...---+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----------...
                              ^
                 Central F = 193.1 THz
]]></artwork>
	</figure>
	<t>
   Unlike the fixed-grid DWDM links, on a flexi-grid DWDM link, the slot
   width of the frequency slot is flexible, as described in <xref target="ranges"/>.
   That is, the value of m in the following formula from <xref target="G.694.1"/> is
   uncertain before a frequency slot is actually allocated for a flexi-grid LSP.</t>

	<t><list hangIndent="13" style="hanging"><t>
                Slot Width (in GHz) = 12.5GHz * m</t>
	</list>
	</t>

	<t>
   For this reason, the available frequency slots (or ranges) are advertised
  for a flexi-grid DWDM link instead of the specific "wavelength"
  points that are sufficient for a fixed-grid link. Moreover, this
   advertisement is represented by the combination of central frequency
   granularity and slot width granularity.</t>

	</section>

	</section>

	<section title="Extensions" anchor="section-4"><t>
   The network-connectivity topology
   constructed by the links and/or nodes and node capabilities are the same as
   for WSON, as described in <xref target="RFC7698"/>, and they can be advertised by the GMPLS routing protocols using
   Opaque Link State Advertisements (LSAs) <xref target="RFC3630"/> in the case of OSPF-TE <xref target="RFC4203"/> (refer to
   Section 6.2 of <xref target="RFC6163"/>).  In the flexi-grid case, the available
   frequency ranges, instead of the specific "wavelengths", are advertised
   for the link.  This section defines the GMPLS OSPF-TE extensions in
   support of advertising the available frequency ranges for flexi-grid
   DWDM links.</t>

	<section title="Interface Switching Capability Descriptor (ISCD) Extensions for Flexi-Grid" anchor="flexi"><t>
   This section defines a new value for the Switching Capability field
   of the ISCD with a value of 152 and type name
   Flexi-Grid-LSC.</t>

	<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
         Value              Name
         -----              --------------
         152                Flexi-Grid-LSC

Switching Capability and Encoding values MUST be used as follows:

         Switching Capability = Flexi-Grid-LSC

         Encoding Type = lambda (as defined in [RFC3471])
]]></artwork>
	</figure>
	<t>
   When the Switching Capability and Encoding fields are set to values as
   stated above, the ISCD is
   interpreted as in <xref target="RFC4203"/> with the optional inclusion of one or
   more Switching Capability-Specific Information (SCSI) sub-TLVs.</t>

	<t>
   As the "Max LSP Bandwidth at priority x" (x from 0 to 7) fields in
   the generic part of the ISCD
   <xref target="RFC4203"/> are not meaningful for flexi-grid DWDM links, the values of
   these fields MUST be set to zero and MUST be ignored.  The SCSI as defined below provides the
   corresponding information for flexi-grid DWDM links.</t>

	<section title="Switching Capability-Specific Information (SCSI)" anchor="switch"><t>
   <xref target="RFC8258"/> defines a Generalized SCSI for the ISCD.  This document
   defines the Frequency Availability Bitmap as a new type of the
   Generalized SCSI TLV.  The technology-specific part of the flexi-grid
   ISCD includes the available frequency-spectrum resource as well as
   the information regarding max slot widths per priority.  The format of this
   flexi-grid SCSI, the Frequency Availability Bitmap sub-TLV, is depicted in
   the following figure:</t>

   Length (16 bits): The length of the value field of this sub-TLV in
   octets.</t>

	<t>
   Priority (8 bits): A bitmap used to indicate which priorities are
   being advertised.  The bitmap is in ascending order, with the
   leftmost bit representing priority level 0 (i.e., the highest) and
   the rightmost bit representing priority level 7 (i.e., the lowest).
   A bit is set (1) corresponding to each priority represented in the
   sub-TLV and clear (0) for each priority not represented in the
   sub-TLV.  At least one priority level MUST be advertised.  If only
   one priority level is advertised, it MUST be at priority level
   0.</t>

	<t>
   Reserved: The Reserved field MUST be set to zero on transmission and MUST be
   ignored on receipt.</t>

	<t>
   Max Slot Width at Priority k (16 bits): This field indicates maximal
   frequency slot width supported at a particular priority level, up to
   8.  This field is set to max frequency slot width supported in the
   unit of 2*C.S., for a particular priority level.  One field MUST be
   present for each bit set in the Priority field, and each present field is ordered to
   match the Priority field.  Fields MUST be present for priority levels
   that are indicated in the Priority field.</t>

	<t>  Unreserved Padding (16 bits): The Padding field is used to
  ensure the 32-bit alignment of Max Slot Width at Priority k. When 
  k is an odd number, the Unreserved Padding field MUST be
  included. When k is an even number, the Unreserved Padding field
  MUST be omitted.  This field MUST be set to 0 and MUST be ignored on
  receipt.

</t>

   C.S. (4 bits): As defined in <xref target="RFC7699"/>; it is currently set to 5.</t>

	<t>Starting n (16 bits): As defined in [RFC7699]. This value denotes
   the starting point of the nominal central frequency of the frequency
   availability bitmap sub-TLV.
   </t>

	<t>
   No. of Effective Bits (12 bits): Indicates the number of effective
   bits in the Bitmap field.</t>

	<t>Bitmap (variable): Indicates whether or not a basic frequency slot,
	characterized by a nominal central frequency and a fixed m value of
   1, is available for flexi-grid LSP setup.  The first nominal
   central frequency is the value of starting n; subsequent
   nominal central frequencies are implied by the position in the bitmap.  
   Note that setting 
   to 1 indicates that the corresponding central frequency is available 
   for a flexi-grid LSP with m=1 and setting to 0 indicates the 
   corresponding central frequency is unavailable.
   Note that a
   centralized SA process will need to extend this to high values of m
   by checking a sufficiently large number of consecutive basic frequency
   slots that are available.

	<t>
   padding bits (variable): Padded after the Bitmap to make it a
   multiple of four bytes, if necessary.  Padding bits MUST be set to 0
   and MUST be ignored on receipt.</t>

   (193.1 + n * 0.00625).  The nominal central frequency is 193.1 THz
   when n equals zero.</t>

   In this example, it is assumed that the lowest nominal central
   frequency supported is n=-9 and the highest is n=11.  Note they

   In the above example, the starting n is selected to be the lowest
   nominal central frequency, i.e., -9.  It is observed from the bitmap
   that n=-1 to 7 can be used to set up LSPs.  Note other starting n
   values can be chosen to represent the bitmap; for example, the first
   available nominal central frequency (a.k.a., the first available
   basic frequency slot) can be chosen, and the SCSI will be expressed as
   the following:</t>

	<section title="Extensions to the Port Label Restrictions Field" anchor="section-4.2"><t>
   As described in <xref target="compliance"/>, a port that supports flexi-grid may
   support only a restricted subset of the full flexible grid.  The Port
   Label Restrictions field is defined in <xref target="RFC7579"/>.  It can be used to
   describe the label restrictions on a port and is carried in the top-level Link TLV as specified in <xref target="RFC7580"/>.  A new restriction type,
   the flexi-grid Restriction Type, is defined here to specify the
   restrictions on a port to support flexi-grid.</t>
