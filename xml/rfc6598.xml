    <abstract>
      <t>This document requests the allocation of an IPv4 /10 address block to
      be used as Shared Address Space to accommodate the needs of
      Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) devices. It is
      anticipated that Service Providers will use this Shared Address Space
      to number the interfaces that connect CGN devices to Customer Premises
      Equipment (CPE).</t>

      <t>Shared Address Space is distinct from RFC 1918 private address space
      because it is intended for use on Service Provider networks. However, it
      may be used in a manner similar to RFC 1918 private address space on
      routing equipment that is able to do address translation across router
      interfaces when the addresses are identical on two different interfaces.
      Details are provided in the text of this document.</t>

      <t>This document details the allocation of an additional special-use
      IPv4 address block and updates RFC 5735.</t>
    </abstract>

  <note title="IESG Note">
  <t>
  A number of operators have expressed a need for the special-purpose
  IPv4 address allocation described by this document.
  During deliberations, the IETF community demonstrated very rough 
  consensus in favor of the allocation.
  </t>

  <t>
  While operational expedients, including the special-purpose address 
  allocation described in this document, may help solve a short-term 
  operational problem, the IESG and the IETF remain committed to the 
  deployment of IPv6.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IPv4 address space is nearly exhausted. However, ISPs must continue
      to support IPv4 growth until IPv6 is fully deployed. To that end, many
      ISPs will deploy a Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) device, such as that
      described in <xref target="RFC6264"></xref>. Because CGNs are used on
      networks where public
      address space is expected, and currently available private address space
      causes operational issues when used in this context, ISPs require a new
      IPv4 /10 address block. This address block will be called the "Shared
      Address Space" and will be used to number the interfaces that connect CGN
      devices to Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).</t>

      <t>Shared Address Space is similar to <xref target="RFC1918"></xref>
      private address space in that it is not globally routable address space
      and can be used by multiple pieces of equipment. However, Shared Address
      Space has limitations in its use that the current <xref
      target="RFC1918"></xref> private address space does not have. In
      particular, Shared Address Space can only be used in Service Provider
      networks or on routing equipment that is able to do address translation
      across router interfaces when the addresses are identical on two
      different interfaces.</t>

      <t>This document requests the allocation of an IPv4 /10 address block to
      be used as Shared Address Space. In conversations with many ISPs, a /10
      is the smallest block that will allow them to deploy CGNs on a regional
      basis without requiring nested CGNs. For instance, as described in <xref
      target="ISP-SHARED-ADDR"></xref>, a /10 is sufficient to
      service Points of Presence in the Tokyo area.</t>

      <t>This document details the allocation of an additional special-use
      IPv4 address block and updates <xref target="RFC5735"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements Language">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Alternatives to Shared Address Space">
      <t>The interfaces that connect CGN devices to CPE might conceivably be
      numbered from any of the following address spaces: <list style="symbols">
          <t>legitimately assigned globally unique address space</t>

          <t>usurped globally unique address space (i.e., squat space)</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC1918"></xref> space</t>

          <t>Shared Address Space</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>A Service Provider can number the interfaces in question from
      legitimately assigned globally unique address space. While this solution
      poses the fewest problems, it is impractical because globally unique
      IPv4 address space is in short supply. While the Regional Internet
      Registries (RIRs) have enough address space to allocate a single /10 to
      be shared by all Service Providers, they do not have enough address
      space to make a unique assignment to each Service Provider.</t>

      <t>Service Providers MUST NOT number the interfaces in question from
      usurped globally unique address space (i.e., squat space). If a Service
      Provider leaks advertisements for squat space into the global Internet,
      the legitimate holders of that address space may be adversely impacted,
      as would those wishing to communicate with them. Even if the Service
      Provider did not leak advertisements for squat space, the Service
      Provider and its subscribers might lose connectivity to the legitimate
      holders of that address space.</t>

      <t>A Service Provider can number the interfaces in question from <xref
      target="RFC1918"></xref> space if at least one of the following
      conditions is true: <list style="symbols">

          <t>The Service Provider knows that the CPE/NAT works correctly when
          the same <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> address block is used on both
          its inside and outside interfaces.</t>

          <t>The Service Provider knows that the <xref
          target="RFC1918"></xref> address block that it uses to number
          interfaces between the CGN and CPE is not used on the subscriber
          side of the CPE.</t>
        </list>Unless at least one of the conditions above is true, the
      Service Provider cannot safely use <xref target="RFC1918"></xref>
      address space and must resort to Shared Address Space. This is typically
      the case in an unmanaged service, where subscribers provide their own
      CPE and number their own internal network.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Use of Shared CGN Space">
      <t>Shared Address Space is IPv4 address space designated for Service
      Provider use with the purpose of facilitating CGN deployment. Also,
      Shared Address Space can be used as additional non-globally routable
      space on routing equipment that is able to do address translation across
      router interfaces when the addresses are identical on two different
      interfaces.</t>

      <t>Devices MUST be capable of performing address translation when
      identical Shared Address Space ranges are used on two different
      interfaces.</t>

      <t>Packets with Shared Address Space source or destination addresses
      MUST NOT be forwarded across Service Provider boundaries. Service
      Providers MUST filter such packets on ingress links. One
      exception to this paragraph's proscription is in the case of business
      relationships, such as hosted CGN services.</t>

      <t>When running a single DNS infrastructure, Service Providers MUST NOT
      include Shared Address Space in zone files. When running a split DNS
      infrastructure, Service Providers MUST NOT include Shared Address Space
      in external-facing zone files.</t>

      <t>Reverse DNS queries for Shared Address Space addresses MUST NOT be
      forwarded to the global DNS infrastructure. DNS Providers SHOULD filter
      requests for Shared Address Space reverse DNS queries on recursive
      nameservers. This is done to avoid having to set up something similar to
      AS112.net for <xref target="RFC1918" /> private address space that a
      host has incorrectly sent for a DNS that reverse-maps queries on the
      public Internet <xref target="RFC6304"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Because CGN service requires non-overlapping address space on each
      side of the home NAT and CGN, entities using Shared Address Space for
      purposes other than for CGN service, as described in this document, are
      likely to experience problems implementing or connecting to CGN service
      at such time as they exhaust their supply of public IPv4 addresses.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Risk">
      <t></t>

      <section title="Analysis">
        <t>Some existing applications discover the outside address of their
        local CPE, determine whether the address is reserved for special use,
        and behave differently based on that determination. If a new IPv4
        address block is reserved for special use and that block is used to
        number CPE outside interfaces, some of the above-mentioned
        applications may fail.</t>

        <t>For example, assume that an application requires its peer (or some
        other device) to initiate an incoming connection directly with its
        CPE's
        outside address. That application discovers the outside address of its
        CPE and determines whether that address is reserved for special use.
        If the address is reserved for special use, the application rightly
        concludes that the address is not reachable from the global Internet
        and behaves in one manner. If the address is not reserved for
        special use, the application assumes that the address is reachable
        from the global Internet and behaves in another manner.</t>

        <t>While the assumption that a non-special-use address is reachable
        from the global Internet is generally safe, it is not always true
        (e.g., when the CPE outside interface is numbered from globally unique
        address space but that address is not advertised to the global
        Internet as when it is behind a CGN). Such an assumption could cause
        certain applications to behave incorrectly in those cases.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Empirical Data">
        <t>The primary motivation for the allocation of Shared Address Space
        is as address space for CGNs; the use and impact of CGNs has been
        previously described in <xref target="RFC6269"></xref> and <xref
        target="NAT444-IMPACTS"></xref>. Some of the services
        adversely impacted by CGNs are as follows:<list style="numbers">
            <t>Console gaming -- some games fail when two subscribers
            using the same outside public IPv4 address try to connect to each
            other.</t>

            <t>Video streaming -- performance is impacted when using one
            of several popular video-streaming technologies to deliver
            multiple video streams to users behind particular CPE routers.</t>

            <t>Peer-to-peer -- some peer-to-peer applications cannot seed
            content due to the inability to open incoming ports through the
            CGN. Likewise, some SIP client implementations cannot receive
            incoming calls unless they first initiate outgoing traffic or open
            an incoming port through the CGN using the Port Control Protocol
            (PCP) <xref target="PCP-BASE"></xref> or a similar mechanism.</t>

            <t>Geo-location -- geo-location systems identify the location of
            the CGN server, not the end host.</t>

            <t>Simultaneous logins -- some websites (particularly banking and
            social-networking websites) restrict the number of simultaneous
            logins per outside public IPv4 address.</t>

            <t>6to4 -- 6to4 requires globally reachable addresses and will not
            work in networks that employ addresses with limited topological
            span, such as those employing CGNs.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Based on testing documented in <xref
        target="NAT444-IMPACTS"></xref>, the CGN impacts on items 1-5
        above are comparable regardless of whether globally unique,
        Shared Address Space, or <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> addresses
        are used. There is,
        however, a difference between the three alternatives in the treatment
        of 6to4.</t>

        <t>As described in <xref target="RFC6343"></xref>, CPE routers do not
        attempt to initialize 6to4 tunnels when they are configured with <xref
        target="RFC1918"></xref> or <xref target="RFC5735"></xref> WAN
        addresses. When configured with globally unique or Shared Address
        Space addresses, such devices may attempt to initiate 6to4, which
        would fail. Service Providers can mitigate this issue using 6to4
        Provider Managed Tunnels <xref target="6to4-PMT"></xref> or
        blocking the route to 192.88.99.1 and generating an IPv4 'destination
        unreachable' message <xref target="RFC6343"></xref>. When the address
        range is well-defined, as with Shared Address Space, CPE router
        vendors can include Shared Address Space in their list of special-use
        addresses (e.g., <xref target="RFC5735"></xref>) and treat Shared
        Address Space similarly to <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> space. When
        the CGN-CPE address range is not well-defined, as in the case of
        globally unique space, it will be more difficult for CPE router
        vendors to mitigate this issue.</t>

        <t>Thus, when comparing the use of <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> and
        Shared Address Space, Shared Address Space poses an additional impact
        on 6to4 connectivity, which can be mitigated by Service Provider or
        CPE router vendor action. On the other hand, the use of <xref
        target="RFC1918"></xref> address space poses more of a challenge
        vis-a-vis Shared Address Space when the subscriber and Service
        Provider use overlapping <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> space, which
        will be outside the Service Provider's control in the case of
        unmanaged service. Service Providers have indicated that it is more
        challenging to mitigate the possibility of overlapping <xref
        target="RFC1918"></xref> address space on both sides of the CPE router
        than it is to mitigate the 6to4 impacts of Shared Address Space.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Similar to other <xref target="RFC5735"></xref> special-use IPv4
      addresses, Shared Address Space does not directly raise security issues.
      However, the Internet does not inherently protect against abuse of these
      addresses. Attacks have been mounted that depend on the unexpected use
      of similar special-use addresses. Network operators are encouraged to
      review this document and determine what security policies should be
      associated with this address block within their specific operating
      environments. They should consider including Shared Address Space in
      Ingress Filter lists <xref target="RFC3704"></xref>, unless their
      Internet service incorporates a CGN.</t>

      <t>To mitigate potential misuse of Shared Address Space, except
      where required for hosted CGN service or a similar business relationship,
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>routing information about Shared Address Space networks MUST NOT
          be propagated across Service Provider boundaries. Service Providers
          MUST filter incoming advertisements regarding Shared Address
          Space.</t>

          <t>packets with Shared Address Space source or destination addresses
          MUST NOT be forwarded across Service Provider boundaries. Service
          Providers MUST filter such packets on ingress links.</t>

          <t>Service Providers MUST NOT include Shared Address Space in
          external-facing DNS zone files.</t>

          <t>reverse DNS queries for Shared Address Space addresses MUST NOT
          be forwarded to the global DNS infrastructure.</t>

          <t>DNS Providers SHOULD filter requests for Shared Address Space
          reverse DNS queries on recursive nameservers.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA has recorded the allocation of an IPv4 /10 for use as
      Shared Address Space.</t>

      <t>The Shared Address Space address range is 100.64.0.0/10.</t>
