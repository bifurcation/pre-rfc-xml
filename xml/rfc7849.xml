      <t>This document defines a profile that is a superset of the
      connection to IPv6 cellular networks defined in the IPv6 for Third
      Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Cellular Hosts document. This
      document defines an IPv6 profile that a number of operators recommend in
      order to connect 3GPP mobile devices to an IPv6-only or dual-stack
      wireless network (including a 3GPP cellular network) with a special focus
      on IPv4 service continuity features.</t>

      <t>Both mobile hosts and mobile devices with the capability to share their
      3GPP mobile connectivity are in scope.</t>

      <t>
	The consensus-based IETF description of IPv6 functionality for
	cellular hosts is described in RFC 7066.

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IPv6 deployment in 3GPP mobile networks is the only viable solution
      to the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses
      in those networks. Several mobile operators have already deployed IPv6
      <xref target="RFC2460"></xref> or are in the pre-deployment phase. One
      of the major hurdles as perceived by some mobile operators is the lack
      of availability of working IPv6 implementation in mobile devices (e.g.,
      Section 3.3 of <xref target="OECD"></xref>).</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC7066"></xref> lists a set of features to be
      supported by cellular hosts to connect to 3GPP mobile networks. In the
      light of recent IPv6 production deployments, additional features to
      facilitate IPv6-only deployments while accessing IPv4-only services
      should be considered. This document fills this void. Concretely, this
      document lists means to ensure IPv4 service over an IPv6-only
      connectivity given the adoption rate of this model by mobile operators.
      Those operators require that no service degradation is experienced by
      customers serviced with an IPv6-only model compared to the level of
      service of customers with legacy IPv4-only devices.</t>

      <t>This document defines an IPv6 profile for mobile devices listing
      specifications produced by various Standards Developing Organizations
      (including 3GPP, IETF, and the Global System for Mobile Communications
      Association (GSMA)). The objectives of this effort
      are as follows:<list style="numbers">
          <t>List in one single document a comprehensive list of IPv6 features
          for a mobile device, including both IPv6-only and dual-stack mobile
          deployment contexts. These features cover various packet core
          architectures such as General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) or
	  Evolved Packet Core (EPC).</t>

          <t>Help operators with the detailed device requirement list
          preparation (to be exchanged with device suppliers). This is also a
          contribution to harmonize operators' requirements towards
          device vendors.</t>

          <t>Inform vendors of a set of features to allow for IPv6
          connectivity and IPv4 service continuity (over an IPv6-only
          transport).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The recommendations do not include 3GPP release details. For more
      information on the 3GPP release details, the reader may refer to Section
      6.2 of <xref target="RFC6459"></xref>. More details can be found at
      <xref target="R3GPP"></xref>.</t>


<t>Some of the features listed in this profile document could require 
that dedicated functions be activated at the network side. It is out of scope of
this document to list these network-side functions.</t>

      <t>A detailed overview of IPv6 support in 3GPP architectures is provided
      in <xref target="RFC6459"></xref>. IPv6-only considerations in mobile
      networks are further discussed in <xref target="RFC6342"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document is organized as follows:<list style="symbols">
          <t><xref target="generic"></xref> lists generic recommendations,
          including functionalities to provide IPv4 service over an IPv6-only
          connectivity.</t>

          <t><xref target="cpe"></xref> enumerates a set of recommendations
          for cellular devices with Local Area Network (LAN) capabilities
          (e.g., Customer Edge (CE) routers with cellular access link,
          dongles with tethering features).</t>

          <t><xref target="adv"></xref> identifies a set of advanced
          recommendations to fulfill requirements of critical services such as
          VoLTE (Voice over Long Term Evolution (LTE)).</t>
        </list></t>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>This document makes use of the terms defined in <xref
        target="RFC6459"></xref>. In addition, the following terms are
        used:<list style="symbols">
            <t>3GPP cellular host (or "cellular host" for short): denotes a 3GPP
            device that can be connected to 3GPP mobile networks.</t>

            <t>3GPP cellular device (or "cellular device" for short): refers to
            a cellular host that supports the capability to share its 3GPP
            mobile connectivity.</t>

            <t>IPv4 service continuity: denotes the features used to provide
            access to IPv4-only services to customers serviced with an
            IPv6-only connectivity. A typical example of IPv4 service
            continuity technique is Network Address and Protocol
            Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers (NAT64) <xref
            target="RFC6146"></xref>.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>PREFIX64 denotes an IPv6 prefix used to build IPv4-converted IPv6
        addresses <xref target="RFC6052"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Scope">
        <t>A 3GPP mobile network can be used to connect various User
        Equipment (UE) such as a mobile telephone or a CE router. Because of this
        diversity of terminals, it is necessary to define a set of IPv6
        functionalities valid for any node directly connecting to a 3GPP
        mobile network. This document describes these functionalities.</t>

        <t>The machine-to-machine (M2M) devices profile is out of scope.</t>

        <t>This document is structured to provide the generic IPv6
        recommendations that are valid for all nodes, whatever their function
        (e.g., host or CE router) or service (e.g., Session Initiation
        Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261"></xref>) capability. The
        document also contains sections covering specific functionalities for
        devices providing some LAN functions (e.g., mobile CE router or
        broadband dongles).</t>

        <t>The recommendations listed below are valid for both 3GPP GPRS and
        3GPP Evolved Packet System (EPS). For EPS, the term "PDN-Connection" is used
        instead of PDP-Context. Other non-3GPP accesses <xref
        target="TS.23402"></xref> are out of scope of this document.</t>

        <t>This profile is a superset of that of the IPv6 profile for <xref
        target="RFC7066">3GPP Cellular Hosts</xref>, which is in turn a
        superset of <xref target="RFC6434">IPv6 Node Requirements</xref>. It
        targets cellular nodes, including GPRS and EPC,
        that require features to ensure IPv4 service delivery over an
        IPv6-only transport in addition to the base IPv6 service. Moreover,
        this profile also covers cellular CE routers that are used in various
        mobile broadband deployments. Recommendations inspired from real
        deployment experiences (e.g., roaming) are included in this profile.
        Also, this profile sketches recommendations for the sake of
        deterministic behaviors of cellular devices when the same
        configuration information is received over several channels.</t>

        <t>For conflicting recommendations in <xref target="RFC7066"></xref>
        and <xref target="RFC6434"></xref> (e.g., Neighbor Discovery
        Protocol), this profile adheres to <xref target="RFC7066"></xref>.
        Indeed, the support of Neighbor Discovery Protocol is mandatory in
        3GPP cellular environment as it is the only way to convey an IPv6 prefix
        towards the 3GPP cellular device. In particular, Maximum
        Transmission Unit (MTU) communication via Router Advertisement (RA) must be
        supported since many 3GPP networks do not have a standard MTU
        setting.</t>

        <t>This profile uses a stronger language for the support of Prefix
        Delegation compared to <xref target="RFC7066"></xref>. The main
        motivation is that cellular networks are more and more perceived as an
        alternative to fixed networks for home IP-based services delivery;
        especially with the advent of smartphones and 3GPP data dongles. There
        is a need for an efficient mechanism to assign larger prefixes to
        cellular hosts so that each LAN segment can get its own /64 prefix and
        multi-link subnet issues to be avoided. The support of this
        functionality in both cellular and fixed networks is key for
        fixed-mobile convergence.</t>

        <t>The use of address-family-dependent Application Programming
        Interfaces (APIs) or hard-coded IPv4 address literals may lead to
        broken applications when IPv6 connectivity is in use. As such, means
        to minimize broken applications when the cellular host is attached to
        an IPv6-only network should be encouraged. Particularly, (1) name
        resolution libraries (e.g., <xref target="RFC3596"></xref>) must
        support both IPv4 and IPv6; (2) applications must be independent of
        the underlying IP address family; and (3) applications relying upon
        Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) must follow <xref
        target="RFC3986"></xref> and its updates. Note, some IETF
        specifications (e.g., SIP <xref target="RFC3261"></xref>) contains
        broken IPv6 Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) and rules to compare
        URIs with embedded IPv6 addresses; fixes (e.g., <xref
        target="RFC5954"></xref>) must be used instead.</t>

        <t>The recommendations included in each section are listed in a
        priority order.</t>

        <t>This document is not a standard, and conformance with it is not
        required in order to claim conformance with IETF standards for IPv6.
        Compliance with this profile does not require the support of all
        enclosed items. Obviously, the support of the full set of features may
        not be required in some deployment contexts. However, the authors
        believe that not supporting relevant features included in this profile
        (e.g., Customer Side Translator (CLAT) <xref
        target="RFC6877"></xref>) may lead to a degraded level of
        service.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="generic" title="Connectivity Recommendations">
      <t>This section identifies the main connectivity recommendations to be
      followed by a cellular host to attach to a network using IPv6 in
      addition to what is defined in <xref target="RFC6434"></xref> and <xref
      target="RFC7066"></xref>. Both dual-stack and IPv6-only deployment
      models are considered. IPv4 service continuity features are listed in
      this section because these are critical for operators with an IPv6-only
      deployment model. These recommendations apply also for cellular devices
      (see <xref target="cpe"></xref>).</t>

      <t><list counter="" style="format C_REC#%d:">

          <t>In order to allow each operator to select their
          own strategy regarding IPv6 introduction, the cellular host must
          support both IPv6 and IPv4v6 PDP-Contexts <xref
          target="TS.23060"></xref>. <vspace blankLines="1" />IPv4, IPv6, or
          IPv4v6 PDP-Context request acceptance depends on the cellular
          network configuration.</t>

          <t>The cellular host must comply with the behavior
          defined in <xref target="TS.23060"></xref>, <xref
          target="TS.23401"></xref>, and <xref target="TS.24008"></xref> for
          requesting a PDP-Context type. <vspace blankLines="1" />In
          particular, the cellular host must request by default an IPv6
          PDP-Context if the cellular host is IPv6-only and request an IPv4v6
          PDP-Context if the cellular host is dual-stack or when the cellular
          host is not aware of connectivity types requested by devices
          connected to it (e.g., a cellular host with LAN capabilities as
          discussed in <xref target="cpe"></xref>): <list style="symbols">
              <t>If the requested IPv4v6 PDP-Context is not supported by the
              network but IPv4 and IPv6 PDP types are allowed, then the
              cellular host will be configured with an IPv4 address or an IPv6
              prefix by the network. It must initiate another PDP-Context
              activation of the other address family in addition to the one
              already activated for a given Access Point Name (APN). The
              purpose of initiating a second PDP-Context is to achieve
              dual-stack connectivity by means of two PDP-Contexts.</t>

              <t>If the subscription data or network configuration allows only
              one IP address family (IPv4 or IPv6), the cellular host must not
              request a second PDP-Context to the same APN for the other IP
              address family.</t>

          host about allowed Packet Data Protocol (PDP) types by means of Session Management (SM)
          cause codes. In particular, the following cause codes can be
          returned:<list style="symbols">
              <t>cause #50 "PDP type IPv4 only allowed" - This cause code is
              used by the network to indicate that only PDP type IPv4 is
              allowed for the requested Public Data Network (PDN) connectivity.</t>

              <t>cause #51 "PDP type IPv6 only allowed" - This cause code is
              used by the network to indicate that only PDP type IPv6 is
              allowed for the requested PDN connectivity.</t>

              <t>cause #52 "single address bearers only allowed" - This cause
              code is used by the network to indicate that the requested PDN
              connectivity is accepted with the restriction that only single
              IP version bearers are allowed.</t>

          explains the behavior for requesting IPv6-related
          PDP-Context(s).</t>

          <t>The cellular host must support the
          Protocol Configuration Options (PCOs) <xref target="TS.24008"></xref> to

              convenient method to inform the cellular host about various
              services, including DNS server information. It does not require
              additional protocol to be supported by the cellular host and it
              is already deployed in IPv4 cellular networks to convey such DNS
              information.</t>

          to limit the PDP type(s) requested by the cellular host when out of
          the home network. Note that distinct PDP type(s) and APN(s) can be
          configured for home and roaming cases.<list style="empty">
              <t>A detailed analysis of roaming failure cases is included in
              <xref target="RFC7445"></xref>.</t>

              <t>The configuration can be either local to the device or be
              managed dynamically using, for example, Open Mobile Alliance
              (OMA) management. The support of dynamic means is
              encouraged.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>In order to ensure IPv4 service continuity in
          an IPv6-only deployment context, the cellular host should support a
          method to learn PREFIX64(s). <list style="empty">
              <t>In the context of NAT64, IPv6-enabled applications relying on
              address referrals will fail because an IPv6-only client will not
              be able to make use of an IPv4 address received in a referral.


              This feature allows for solving the referral problem (because an
              IPv6-enabled application can construct IPv4-embedded IPv6
              addresses <xref target="RFC6052"></xref>) and, also, for
              distinguishing between IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses and native
              IPv6 addresses. In other words, this feature contributes to
              offload both the CLAT module and NAT64 devices. Refer to Section 3
              of <xref target="RFC7051"></xref> for an inventory of the issues
              related to the discovery of PREFIX64(s).</t>

              <t>In environments based on the Port Control Protocol (PCP), cellular hosts should follow <xref
              target="RFC7225"></xref> to learn the IPv6 Prefix used by an
              upstream PCP-controlled NAT64 device. If PCP is not enabled, the
              cellular host should implement the method specified in <xref
              target="RFC7050"></xref> to retrieve the PREFIX64.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>In order to ensure IPv4 service continuity in
          an IPv6-only deployment context, the cellular host should implement
          the CLAT <xref target="RFC6877"></xref>
          function in compliance with <xref target="RFC6052"></xref>, <xref
          target="RFC6145"></xref>, and <xref target="RFC6146"></xref>. <list
              style="empty">
              <t>The CLAT function in the cellular host allows for IPv4-only
              application and IPv4 referrals to work on an IPv6-only
              connectivity. The more applications are address family
              independent, the less the CLAT function is solicited. The CLAT function
              requires a NAT64 capability <xref target="RFC6146"></xref> in
              the network.</t>

              <t>The cellular host should only invoke CLAT in the absence
              of IPv4 connectivity on the cellular side, i.e., when the
              network does not assign an IPv4 address on the cellular
              interface. Note, NAT64 assumes an IPv6-only mode <xref

<t>The cellular device can act as a CE router connecting
various IP hosts on a LAN segment; this is also the case 
with using WLAN (Wireless LAN) tethering or a WLAN 
hotspot from the cellular device. 
              Some of these IP hosts can be dual-stack, others are
              IPv6-only or IPv4-only. IPv6-only connectivity on the cellular
              device does not allow IPv4-only sessions to be established for
              hosts connected on the LAN segment of the cellular device. IPv4
              session establishment initiated from hosts located on the LAN
              segment side and destined for IPv4 nodes must be maintained. A
              solution is to integrate the CLAT function to the LAN segment in
              the cellular device. </t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The cellular host may be able to be configured to limit PDP
          type(s) for a given APN. The default mode is to allow all supported
          PDP types. Note, C_REC#2 discusses the default behavior for
          requesting PDP-Context type(s). <list style="empty">
              <t>This feature is useful to drive the behavior of the UE to be
              aligned with (1) service-specific constraints such as the use
              of IPv6-only for VoLTE, (2) network conditions
              with regard to the support of specific PDP types (e.g., IPv4v6
              PDP-Context is not supported), (3) IPv4 sunset objectives, (4)
              subscription data, etc.</t>

              <t>Note, a cellular host changing its connection between an
              IPv6-specific APN and an IPv4-specific APN will interrupt
              related network connections. This may be considered as a
              brokenness situation by some applications.</t>

    <section anchor="cpe"
             title="Recommendations for Cellular Devices with LAN Capabilities">
      <t>This section focuses on cellular devices (e.g., CE routers,
      smartphones, or dongles with tethering features) that provide IP
      connectivity to other devices connected to them. In this case, all
      connected devices are sharing the same 2G, 3G, or LTE connection. In
      addition to the generic recommendations listed in <xref
      target="generic"></xref>, these cellular devices have to meet the
      recommendations listed below.</t>

      <t><list style="format L_REC#%d:">


	<t hangText="REQ#27:">For deployments that require that the same /64
	prefix be shared, the cellular device should support <xref target="RFC7278"/> to enable sharing
	a /64 prefix between the LAN and the WAN interfaces. The WAN 
	interface is the one towards the Gateway GPRS
	Support Node (GGSN) / Packet Data Network Gateway (PGW).<list style="empty">
              <t>Prefix Delegation (refer to L_REC#2) is the target solution
              for distributing prefixes in the LAN side but, because the
              device may attach to earlier 3GPP release networks, a means to
              share a /64 prefix is also recommended <xref
              target="RFC7278"></xref>.</t>

              <t><xref target="RFC7278"></xref> must be invoked only if Prefix
              Delegation is not in use.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The cellular device must support Prefix
          Delegation capabilities <xref target="RFC3633"></xref> and must
          support the Prefix Exclude Option for DHCPv6-based Prefix Delegation as
          defined in <xref target="RFC6603"></xref>. Particularly, it must
          behave as a Requesting Router. <list style="empty">
              <t>Cellular networks are more and more perceived as an
              alternative to fixed broadband networks for home IP-based
              services delivery; especially with the advent of smartphones and
              3GPP data dongles. There is a need for an efficient mechanism to
              assign larger prefixes (other than /64s) to cellular hosts so
              that each LAN segment can get its own /64 prefix and multi-link
              subnet issues to be avoided.</t>

              <t>In case a prefix is delegated to a cellular host using
              DHCPv6, the cellular device will be configured with two
              prefixes: <list style="format (%d)">
                  <t>one for the 3GPP link allocated using the Stateless Address
                  Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) mechanism and</t>

                  <t>another one delegated for LANs acquired during the Prefix
                  Delegation operation.</t>
                </list>Note that the 3GPP network architecture requires both
              the WAN and the delegated prefix to be
              aggregatable so the subscriber can be identified using a single
              prefix.</t>

              <t>Without the Prefix Exclude Option, the delegating router
              (GGSN/PGW) will have to ensure
              compliance with <xref target="RFC3633"/> (e.g., halving the delegated prefix and assigning the
              WAN prefix out of the first half and the prefix to be delegated to
              the terminal from the second half).</t>

              <t>Because Prefix Delegation capabilities may not be available
              in some attached networks, L_REC#1 is strongly recommended to
              accommodate early deployments.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The cellular CE router must be compliant with
          the requirements specified in <xref target="RFC7084"></xref>.<list
              style="empty">
              <t>There are several deployments, particularly in emerging
              countries, that rely on mobile networks to provide broadband
              services (e.g., customers are provided with mobile CE
              routers).</t>

              <t>Note, this profile does not require IPv4 service continuity
              techniques listed in Section 4.4 of <xref
              target="RFC7084"></xref> because those are specific to fixed
              networks. IPv4 service continuity techniques specific to the
              mobile networks are included in this profile.</t>

              <t>This recommendation does not apply to handsets with tethering
              capabilities; it is specific to cellular CE routers in order to
              ensure the same IPv6 functional parity for both fixed and
              cellular CE routers. Note, modern CE routers are designed with
              advanced functions such as link aggregation that consists in
              optimizing the network usage by aggregating the connectivity
              resources offered via various interfaces (e.g., Digital
              Subscriber Line (DSL), LTE, WLAN, etc.) or offloading the
              traffic via a subset of interfaces. Ensuring IPv6 feature
              parity among these interface types is important for the sake of
              specification efficiency, service design simplification, and
              validation effort optimization.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>If an RA MTU is advertised from the 3GPP
          network, the cellular device should send RAs to the downstream
          attached LAN devices with the same MTU as seen on the mobile
          interface. <list style="empty">
              <t>Receiving and relaying RA MTU values facilitates a more
              harmonious functioning of the mobile core network where end
              nodes transmit packets that do not exceed the MTU size of the
              mobile network's tunnels that use the GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP).</t>

              <t><xref target="TS.23060"></xref> indicates providing a link
              MTU value of 1358 octets to the 3GPP cellular device will
              prevent the IP layer fragmentation within the transport network
              between the cellular device and the GGSN/PGW. More details about
              link MTU considerations can be found in Annex C of <xref

    <section anchor="adv" title="Advanced Recommendations">
      <t>This section identifies a set of advanced recommendations to fulfill
      requirements of critical services such as VoLTE. These recommendations
      apply for mobile hosts, including mobile devices.</t>

      <t><list style="format A_REC#%d:">

          <t>The cellular host must support the RObust Header
	  Compression (ROHC) RTP
          Profile (0x0001) and the ROHC UDP Profile (0x0002) for IPv6 <xref
          target="RFC5795"></xref>. Other ROHC profiles may be
          supported.<list style="empty">
              <t>Bandwidth in cellular networks must be optimized as much as
              possible. ROHC provides a solution to reduce bandwidth
              consumption and to reduce the impact of having bigger packet
              headers in IPv6 compared to IPv4.</t>

              <t>The "RTP/UDP/IP" ROHC profile (0x0001) to compress RTP packets
              and the "UDP/IP" ROHC profile (0x0002) to compress Real-time
	      Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) packets are
              required for VoLTE by Section 4.1 of IR.92.7.0
              <xref target="IR92"></xref>. Note, <xref target="IR92"></xref>
              indicates that the host must be able to apply the compression to
              packets that are carried over the voice-media-dedicated radio
              bearer.</t>

            </list></t>

          <t>The cellular host should support PCP <xref
          target="RFC6887"></xref>.<list style="empty">
              <t>The support of PCP is seen as a driver to save battery
              consumption exacerbated by keep-alive messages. PCP also gives
              the possibility of enabling incoming connections to the cellular
              device. Indeed, because several stateful devices may be deployed
              in wireless networks (e.g., NAT64 and/or IPv6 Firewalls), PCP
              can be used by the cellular host to control network-based NAT64
              and IPv6 Firewall functions that will reduce per-application
              signaling and save battery consumption.</t>

              <t>According to <xref target="Power"></xref>, the consumption of
              a cellular device with a keep-alive interval equal to 20 seconds
              (which is the default value in <xref target="RFC3948"></xref>, for
              example) is 29&nbsp;mA&nbsp;(2G) / 34&nbsp;mA&nbsp;(3G). This consumption is reduced
              to 16&nbsp;mA&nbsp;(2G) / 24&nbsp;mA&nbsp;(3G) when the interval is increased to 40
              seconds, to 9.1&nbsp;mA&nbsp;(2G) / 16&nbsp;mA&nbsp;(3G) if the interval is equal to
              150 seconds, and to 7.3&nbsp;mA&nbsp;(2G) / 14&nbsp;mA&nbsp;(3G) if the interval is
              equal to 180 seconds. When no keep-alive is issued, the
              consumption would be 5.2&nbsp;mA&nbsp;(2G) / 6.1&nbsp;mA&nbsp;(3G). The impact of
              keepalive messages would be more severe if multiple applications
              are issuing those messages (e.g., SIP, IPsec, etc.).</t>

<t>Deploying PCP allows cellular hosts to manage protocols that convey IP
addresses and/or port numbers (see Section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC6889"/>)
without requiring Application Level Gateways (ALGs) to be enabled at the
network side (e.g., NAT64). Avoiding soliciting ALGs makes it easier to develop a service without any
adherence with the underlying transport network.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>In order for host-based validation of DNS
          Security Extensions (DNSSEC) to continue to function in an IPv6-only
          connectivity with NAT64 deployment context, the cellular host should
          embed a DNS64 function (<xref target="RFC6147"></xref>). <list
              style="empty">
              <t>This is called "DNS64 in stub-resolver mode" in <xref
              target="RFC6147"></xref>.</t>

              <t>As discussed in Section 5.5 of <xref
              target="RFC6147"></xref>, a security-aware and validating host
              has to perform the DNS64 function locally.</t>

              <t>Because synthetic AAAA records cannot be successfully
              validated in a host, learning the PREFIX64 used to construct
              IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses allows the use of DNSSEC <xref
              target="RFC4033"> </xref> <xref target="RFC4034"></xref> <xref
              target="RFC4035"></xref>. Means to configure or discover a
              PREFIX64 are required on the cellular device as discussed in
              C_REC#7.</t>

              <t><xref target="RFC7051"></xref> discusses why a security-aware
              and validating host has to perform the DNS64 function locally
              and why it has to be able to learn the proper PREFIX64(s).</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>When the cellular host is dual-stack connected
          (i.e., configured with an IPv4 address and IPv6 prefix), it should
          support means to prefer a native IPv6 connection over a connection
          established through translation devices (e.g., NAT44 and
          NAT64).<list style="empty">
              <t>When both IPv4 and IPv6 DNS servers are configured, a
              dual-stack host must first contact its IPv6 DNS server. This
              preference allows it to offload IPv4-only DNS servers.</t>

              <t>Cellular hosts should follow the procedure specified in <xref

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations identified in <xref
      target="RFC7066"></xref> and <xref target="RFC6459"></xref> are to be
      taken into account.</t>

      <t>In the case of cellular CE routers, compliance with L_REC#3 entails
      compliance with <xref target="RFC7084"></xref>, which in turn recommends
      compliance with Recommended Simple Security Capabilities in Customer
      Premises Equipment (CPE) for Providing Residential IPv6 Internet Service
      <xref target="RFC6092"></xref>. Therefore, the security considerations
      in Section 6 of <xref target="RFC6092"></xref> are relevant. In
      particular, it bears repeating here that the true impact of stateful
      filtering may be a reduction in security and that the IETF makes no
      statement, expressed or implied, as to whether using the capabilities
      described in any of these documents ultimately improves security for any
      individual users or for the Internet community as a whole.</t>

      <t>The cellular host must be able to generate IPv6 addresses that
      preserve privacy. The activation of the privacy extension (e.g., using <xref
      target="RFC7217"></xref>) makes it more difficult to track a host over
      time when compared to using a permanent Interface Identifier. Tracking a
      host is still possible based on the first 64 bits of the IPv6 address.
      Means to prevent against such tracking issues may be enabled in the
      network side. Note, privacy extensions are required by regulatory bodies
      in some countries.</t>

      <t>Host-based validation of DNSSEC is discussed in A_REC#3 (see <xref
      target="adv"></xref>).</t>
