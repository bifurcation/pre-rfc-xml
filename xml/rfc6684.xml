  <abstract> 

    <t>This document provides guidelines for extensions to the Incident Object
    Description Exchange Format (IODEF) described in RFC 5070 for
    exchange of incident management data, and it contains a template for
    Internet-Drafts describing those extensions, in order to ease the work and
    improve the quality of extension descriptions. </t>

<section title="Introduction" anchor="sec-intro">

  <t>In the five years since the specification of <xref
  target="RFC5070">IODEF</xref>, the threat environment has evolved, as has
  the practice of cooperative network defense. These trends, along with
  experience gained through implementation and deployment, have indicated the
  need to extend IODEF. This document provides guidelines for defining these
  extensions. It starts by describing the applicability of IODEF extensions,
  and the IODEF extension mechanisms, before providing a section (<xref
  target="sec-template"/>) that contains a template to be the starting point for any future Internet-Draft about an IODEF extension.</t>

  <t>This document is designed to give guidance on the extension of IODEF,
  especially for those extension authors who may be new to the IETF process.
  Nothing in this document should be construed as defining policies for the
  definition of these extensions.</t>

  <t>At publication time, the Managed Incident Lightweight Exchange (MILE)
  working group of the IETF provides a home for work on IODEF extensions that
  do not otherwise have a natural home. IODEF extensions that require the
  expertise of other IETF working groups or other standards development
  organizations may be done within those groups with consultation of IODEF
  experts, such as those appointed for review as in <xref
  target="RFC6685"/>.</t>


</section>



<section title="Applicability of Extensions to IODEF">

  <t>Before deciding to extend IODEF, the first step is to determine whether
  an IODEF extension is a good fit for a given problem. There are two sides to
  this question:</t>

  <t><list style="numbers">

    <t>Does the problem involve the reporting or sharing of observations,
    indications, or other information about an incident, whether in progress
    or completed, hypothetical or real? "Incident" is defined in the
    terminology for the original IODEF requirements <xref target="RFC3067"/>:
    an event that involves a security violation, whether a single attack of a
    group thereof. If the answer to this question is unequivocally "No", then
    IODEF is probably not a good choice as a base technology for the
    application area.</t>

    <t>Can IODEF adequately represent information about the incident without
    extension? IODEF has a rich set of incident-relevant classes. If, after
    detailed examination of the problem area and the IODEF specification, and
    consultation with IODEF experts, the answer to this question is "Yes",
    then extension is not necessary.</t>

  </list></t>

  <t>Examples of such extensions to IODEF might include the following:</t>
 
  <t><list style="symbols">

    <t>Leveraging existing work in describing aspects of incidents to make
    IODEF more expressive, by standardized reference to external information
    bases about incidents and incident-related information</t>

    <t>Allowing the description of new types of entities (e.g., related
    actors) or new types of characteristics of entities (e.g., information
    related to financial services) involved in an IODEF incident report</t>

    <t>Allowing the representation of new types of indicators, observables,
    or incidents in an IODEF incident report</t>

    <t>Allowing additional semantic or metadata labeling of IODEF Documents
    (e.g., for handling or disposition instructions, or compliance with data
    protection and data retention regulations)</t>

  </list></t>

</section>

<section title="Selecting a Mechanism for IODEF Extension" anchor="sec-mechanisms">

  <t>IODEF was designed to be extended through any combination of the following:</t>

    <t><list style="numbers">

      <t>extending the enumerated values of Attributes, per Section 5.1 of
      <xref target="RFC5070"/>;</t>

      <t>class extension through AdditionalData or RecordItem elements, 
      per Section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC5070"/>; and/or</t>

      <t>containment of the IODEF Document element within an external XML
      Document, itself containing extension data, as done by Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) <xref
      target="RFC6545"/>.</t>

    </list></t>

    <t>Note that in this final case, the extension will not be directly
    interoperable with IODEF implementations, and it must "unwrap" the IODEF
    document from its container; nevertheless, this may be appropriate for
    certain use cases involving integration of IODEF within external
    schemas. Extensions using containment of an IODEF Document are not further
    treated in this document, though the document template in <xref
    target="sec-template"/> may be of some use in defining them.</t>

    <t>Certain attributes containing enumerated values within certain IODEF
    elements may be extended. For an attribute named "foo", this is achieved
    by giving the value of "foo" as "ext-value" and adding a new attribute
    named "ext-foo" containing the extended value. The attributes that can be
    extended this way are limited to the following, denoted in
    'Element@attribute' format, referencing the section in which they are
    defined in <xref target="RFC5070"/>:</t>

    <t><list style="empty">
      <t>Incident@purpose, Section 3.2<vspace blankLines='0'/>
         AdditionalData@dtype, Section 3.6<vspace blankLines='0'/>
         Contact@role, Section 3.7<vspace blankLines='0'/>
         Contact@type, Section 3.7<vspace blankLines='0'/>
         RegistryHandle@registry, Section 3.7.1<vspace blankLines='0'/>
         Impact@type, Section 3.10.1<vspace blankLines='0'/>
         TimeImpact@metric, Section 3.10.2<vspace blankLines='0'/>
         TimeImpact@duration, Section 3.10.2<vspace blankLines='0'/>
         HistoryItem@action, Section 3.11.1<vspace blankLines='0'/>
         Expectation@action, Section 3.13<vspace blankLines='0'/>
         System@category, Section 3.15<vspace blankLines='0'/>
         Counter@type, Section 3.16.1<vspace blankLines='0'/>
         Counter@duration, Section 3.16.1<vspace blankLines='0'/>
         Address@category, Section 3.16.2<vspace blankLines='0'/>
         NodeRole@category, Section 3.16.3<vspace blankLines='0'/>
         RecordPattern@type, Section 3.19.2<vspace blankLines='0'/>
         RecordPattern@offsetunit, Section 3.19.2<vspace blankLines='0'/>
         RecordItem@dtype, Section 3.19.3</t>
    </list></t>

    <t>Note that this list is current as of publication time; the set of
    IODEF data types may be extended by future specifications that update
    <xref target="RFC5070"/>.</t>

    <t>An example definition of an attribute extension is given in <xref
    target="ext-defenum"/>.</t>

    <t>IODEF Documents can contain extended scalar or XML data using an
    AdditionalData element or a RecordItem element. Scalar data extensions
    must set the "dtype" attribute of the containing element to the data type
    to reference one of the IODEF data types as enumerated in Section 2 of
    <xref target="RFC5070"/>, and it should use the "meaning" and "formatid"
    attributes to explain the content of the element.</t>

    <t>XML extensions within an AdditionalData or RecordItem element use a
    dtype of "xml", and they should define a schema for the topmost containing
    element within the AdditionalData or RecordItem element. An example
    definition of an element definition is given in <xref
    target="ext-defelem"/>.</t>

    <t>When adding elements to the AdditionalData section of an IODEF
    document, an extension's namespace and schema should be registered with
    IANA; see <xref target="ext-iana"/> for details.</t>

</section>

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sec-security">

  <t>This document raises no security issues itself. Extensions defined using
  the template in Appendix A need to provide an analysis of security issues
  they may raise. See <xref target="ext-security"/> for details.</t>

<section title="Document Template" anchor="sec-template">

    <t>The document template given in this section is provided as a starting
    point for writing an Internet-Draft describing an IODEF extension. RFCs
    are subject to additional formatting requirements and must contain
    additional sections not described in this template; consult the RFC Editor
    style guide (http://www.rfc-editor.org/styleguide.html) for more
    information.</t>

    <t>This template is informational in nature; in case of any future
    conflict with RFC Editor requirements for Internet-Drafts, those
    requirements take precedence.</t>

   <section title="Introduction" anchor="ext-intro">

    <t>The Introduction section lays out the problem being solved by the
    extension, and motivates the development and deployment of the
    extension.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Terminology" anchor="ext-terminology">

    <t>The Terminology section introduces and defines terms specific to the
    document. Terminology from <xref target="RFC5070"/> or <xref
    target="RFC6545"/> should be referenced in this section,
    but not redefined or copied. If <xref target="RFC2119"/> terms are used in
    the document, this should be noted in the Terminology section.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Applicability" anchor="ext-applicability">

    <t>The Applicability section defines the use cases to which the extension
    is applicable, and it details any requirements analysis done during the
    development of the extension. The primary goal of this section is to allow
    readers to see if an extension is indeed intended to solve a given
    problem. This section should also define and restrict the scope of the
    extension, as appropriate, by pointing out any non-obvious situations to
    which it is not intended to apply.</t>

    <t>In addition to defining the applicability, this section may also
    present example situations, which should then be detailed in the examples
    section, below.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Extension Definition" anchor="ext-definition">

    <t>This section defines the extension.</t>

    <t>Extensions to enumerated types are defined in one subsection for each
    attribute to be extended, enumerating the new values with an explanation
    of the meaning of each new value. An example enumeration extension is
    shown in <xref target="ext-defenum"/>, below.</t>

    <t>Element extensions are defined in one subsection for each element, in
    top-down order, from the element contained within AdditionalData or
    RecordItem; an example element extension is shown in <xref
    target="ext-defelem"/>, below. Each element should be described by a Unified Modeling Language (UML)
    diagram as in <xref target="fig-element"/>, followed by a description of
    each of the attributes, and a short description of each of the child
    elements. Child elements should then be defined in a subsequent
    subsection, if not already defined in the IODEF Document itself, or in
    another referenced IODEF extension document.</t>

<figure title="Example UML Element Diagram"  anchor="fig-element">
  <artwork><![CDATA[
+---------------------+
| Element             |
+---------------------+
| TYPE attribute0     |<>----------[ChildExactlyOne]
| TYPE attribute1     |<>--{0..1}--[ChildZeroOrOne]
|                     |<>--{0..*}--[ChildZeroOrMore]
|                     |<>--{1..*}--[ChildOneOrMore]
+---------------------+
]]></artwork>
</figure>

    <t>Elements containing child elements should indicate the multiplicity of those child elements, as shown in the figure above. Allowable TYPEs are enumerated in Section 2 of <xref target="RFC5070"/>.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="ext-security">

    <t>Any <xref target="RFC3552">security considerations</xref> raised by
    this extension or its deployment should be detailed in this section.
    Guidance should focus on ensuring the users of this extension do so in a
    secure fashion, with special attention to non-obvious implications of the
    transmission of the information represented by this extension. <xref
    target="RFC3552"/> may be a useful reference in determining what to cover
    in this section. This section is required by the RFC Editor.</t>

    <t>It should also be noted in this section that the security
    considerations for <xref target="RFC5070">IODEF</xref> apply to the
    extension as well. </t>

  </section>

  <section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="ext-iana">

    <t>Any <xref target="RFC5226">IANA considerations</xref> for the document
    should be detailed in this section. Note that IODEF extension documents
    will generally register new namespaces and schemas. In addition, this
    section is required by the RFC Editor, so if there are no IANA
    considerations, the section should exist and contain the text "this
    document has no actions for IANA".</t>

    <t>IODEF Extensions that represent an enumeration should reference an
    existing IANA registry or subregistry for the values of that enumeration.
    If no such registry exists, this section should define a new registry to
    hold the enumeration's values and define the policies by which additions
    may be made to the registry.</t>

    <t>IODEF Extensions adding elements to the AdditionalData section of an
    IODEF Document should register their own namespaces and schemas for
    extensions with IANA; therefore, this section should contain at least a
    registration request for the namespace and the schema, as follows,
    modified as appropriate for the extension:</t>

    <t>Registration request for the IODEF My-Extension namespace:</t>

    <t>&nbsp;&nbsp;URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:iodef-myextension-1.0 </t>

    <t>&nbsp;&nbsp;Registrant Contact: Refer here to the Authors' Addresses section of the document, or to an organizational contact in the case of an extension supported by an external organization.</t>

    <t>&nbsp;&nbsp;XML: None </t>
    
    <t>Registration request for the IODEF My-Extension XML schema:</t>

    <t>&nbsp;&nbsp;URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:iodef-myextension-1.0 </t>

    <t>&nbsp;&nbsp;Registrant Contact: Refer here to the Authors' Addresses section of the document, or to an organizational contact in the case of an extension supported by an external organization.</t>

    <t>&nbsp;&nbsp;XML: Refer here to the XML Schema in Appendix A of the document, or to a well-known external reference in the case of an extension with an externally defined schema.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Manageability Considerations" anchor="ext-ops">

    <t>If any of the operational and/or management considerations listed in Appendix A of <xref target="RFC5706"/> apply to the extension, address them in this section. If no such considerations apply, this section can be omitted.</t>
    
  </section>

  
  <section title="Appendix A: XML Schema Definition for Extension" anchor="ext-schema">

    <t>The XML Schema describing the elements defined in the Extension Definition section is given here. Each of the examples in <xref target="ext-examples"/> will be verified to validate against this schema by automated tools.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Appendix B: Examples" anchor="ext-examples">

    <t>This section contains example IODEF Documents illustrating the
    extension. If example situations are outlined in the Applicability
    section, documents for those examples should be provided in the same order
    as in the Applicability section. Example documents will be tested to
    validate against the schema given in the appendix.</t>

  </section>

   <section title="Example Enumerated Type Extension Definition: Presentation Action" anchor="ext-defenum">
      <t>This example extends the IODEF Expectation element to represent the expectation that a slide deck be derived from the IODEF Incident, and that a presentation be given by the recipient's organization thereon.</t>
      
      <t>Attribute: Expectation@action</t>
      
      <t>Extended value(s): give-a-presentation</t>

      <t>Value meaning: generate a slide deck from the provided incident
      information and give a presentation thereon.</t>

      <t>Additional considerations: the format of the slide deck is left to
      the recipient to determine in accordance with its established practices
      for the presentation of incident reports.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Example Element Definition: Test" anchor="ext-defelem">
      <t>This example defines the Test class for labeling IODEF test data.</t>

      <t>The Test class is intended to be included within an AdditionalData element in an IODEF Document. If a Test element is present, it indicates that an IODEF Document contains test data, not a information about a real incident.</t>
