<abstract>
      <t>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and Request for
Comments (RFC) Editor
		have a long-standing rule that a document at a given
		maturity level cannot be published until all of the documents
		that it references as normative are
		at that maturity level or 
		higher.  This rule has sometimes resulted in very long
		publication delays for documents and some claims that it was
		a major obstruction to advancing documents in maturity level.
		The IETF agreed on a way to bypass this rule with RFC 3967.
This document describes a simpler procedure for downward references to
Standards-Track and Best Current Practice (BCP) documents, namely "note and move on".  The procedure in
RFC 3967 still applies for downward references to other classes of documents.  In
both cases, annotations should be added to such References.

<section title="Introduction">
    <!--	Spencer: ...Introduction it would be good to put RFC 3967 up front - something like
		"In RFC 3967, the IESG have relaxed a long-standing IETF/RFC Editor rule ...".
		In my opinion, of course. -->
    <t>The IETF and RFC Editor have a long-standing rule (see, e.g.,
	   <xref target="RFC2026">RFC 2026, Section 4.2.4 </xref> and the
	   extended discussion in <xref target="RFC3967">RFC 3967</xref>)
	   that a 
		 document at a given maturity level cannot be published until
		 all of the documents to which it makes a normative
                 reference are at that maturity level or
		 higher.  This rule has sometimes resulted in very long
		 publication delays for documents and some claims that it was
		 a major obstruction to advancing documents in maturity level.
		 Recognizing the problems that this rule sometimes caused,
		 RFC 3967 established an exception procedure for normative downward 
		 references under some specific circumstances.  Perhaps
		 because of its fairly stringent requirements, RFC 3967 has
		 not proven adequate either to clear the backlog of documents
		 awaiting upgraded documents or to prevent additional
		 documents from joining that queue.</t>
      <t><!-- [Auth/JcK 2] Previous subsequent paragraphs rewritten --
		 see email -->
		 This document replaces the long-standing rule for downward
		 references to Standards-Track documents (including BCPs)
		 that are already published.   For normative references to
		 Standards-Track and BCP documents, that rule was to hold the
		 newer, referencing, document until the referenced ones could be
		 brought to the appropriate maturity level.  It is now
		 possible, following procedures described below, to simply
		 note the downward normative reference and move on.</t>
      <t><!-- [Auth/JcK 2] Sentence rewritten from "This document also updates RFC 3967 to encourage downward
references approved through that procedure be noted in the same way
		 as references approved under this rule." to-->
		 This document also updates RFC 3967.  When downward
		 references from a source document are approved under the
		 procedure specified in that specification, we recommend that
		 the references in the approved (source) document be
		 annotated in the same way as references approved under this
		 rule. </t>  
   </section>

   <section title="Terminology">
	  <t> A reference involves two documents, the one in which the
		 reference is embedded and the document referenced.   Where
		 needed for clarity, these documents are referred to as the
		 "source document" and "target document", respectively.</t>
	  <t>The term "Standards-Track document", as used in this
		 specification, is assumed to include BCPs but not
		 Informational or Experimental documents of any variety or
		 origin.</t> 
	  </section>

   <section title="Normative Reference Rule">
	  <t> This document specifies an alternative to holding source
		 documents until all target documents referenced
		 normatively are upgraded or by applying the procedure
		 of RFC 3967. 

<!-- [rfced] our intent with this suggestion was to clarify that
there is possible confusion here.

   This document specifies an alternative to holding source documents
   until all target documents referenced normatively are upgraded or
   until the source document has been processed via the procedure
   defined in RFC 3967.

It is the source document (not the target documents) that needs to be
processed via the procedure in RFC 3967 right?  -->


</t>
	<section title="Source Documents Not Yet Processed by the IESG">
	   <t>An author or editor who requires a normative downward
		  reference to a Standards-Track RFC uses the following very simple procedure: 
		 <vspace blankLines="1"/>
		 <list style="symbols">
			<t>The reference text (i.e., in the "Normative
			   References" section of the source document) is written
			   as usual.</t> 
			<t>A note is included in the reference text that
			   indicates that the reference is to a target
			   document of a lower maturity level, that some caution
			   should be used since it may be less stable than the
			   document from which it is being referenced, and,
			   optionally, explaining why the downward reference is
			   appropriate.</t>
			</list></t>
		 <t>The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) may, at its discretion, specify the exact text to
			be used, establish procedures regarding the
			   text to use, or give guidance on this
			   text.  When establishing procedures, the
			   IESG should seek appropriate community review.</t>
		 <t>These annotations are part of the source document.  If members of
			the community consider either the downward reference or
			the annotation text to be inappropriate, those issues can
			be raised at any time during the document life cycle,
			just as with any other text in the document.  There is no
			separate review of these references.</t>
	<t>With appropriate community review, the IESG  may establish
			   procedures for when normative downward
			   references should delay a document and when
			   downward references should be noted.
			   Absent specific guidance, authors and
			   reviewers should use their best judgment.  It
			   is assumed that, in a significant majority
			   of cases, noting a downward reference is
			   preferable to delaying publication.  </t>
		 <t>At the option of the author, similar notes may be attached
			to non-normative references.</t>
		 </section>
		 <section title="Documents Already in the RFC Editor Queue">
			<t>The IESG may, at its discretion, specify a procedure to
			   be applied to source documents that are already in the RFC
			   Editor queue, awaiting target referenced
			   documents.  The IESG should encourage
			   authors with documents in the RFC Editor
			   queue awaiting downward references to
			   Standards-Track RFCs to evaluate whether
			   this new rule is appropriate for their
			   documents.  If authors believe that adding
			   an annotation and releasing the document
			   is the best way forward, then the IESG
			   should ensure that appropriate review is
			   conducted and, if that review agrees with that of
			   the authors' evaluation, allow the annotations to be
			   added.  The IESG will announce its decision via the
			   normal Protocol-Action or Document-Action mechanisms.
			   <!-- per discussion with Sam 20070209: there is a case
			      to be made for Last Call here, but Last Calls take a
			      lot of time and cause delays.  A formal announcement
			      means that anyone who is really upset can appeal.
			      And the IESG retains its right to Last Call
			      anything, including some, none, or all of these, if
			      it decides it needs that advice ...JcK --></t>
		 </section>
		 <!-- if this is moved directly to BCP, Brian suggests (note
		 of 24 Nov 2006) adding the following as an additional
		 subsection.  I have modified the text slightly, consistent
		 with my response to that note.
-->

		 </section>
    <section title="Target Documents Not on the Standards Track">
      <t>
			In the case of a normative reference to a
			document not on the standards track that is approved under
		    the procedures defined in RFC 3967, the annotation described
			in Section 3.1 or the retrospective annotation described in
			Section 3.2, SHOULD be added to the reference unless the
			IESG, after consideration of Last Call input, concludes it is
			inappropriate.  </t>
    </section>
		 <section title="Target Documents that Can Be Referenced This Way"
				  anchor="downgradable">
			<t>The "downward reference by annotation" model
			   specified here is applicable only to published
			   Standards-Track RFCs at lower maturity levels.</t>

			   <t> Obviously, such downward references are part of the
				  relevant source document at IETF Last Call and subject to
				  comments from the community.</t>
			   <t> Advancing documents, when appropriate, is still
				  considered preferable to the use of either this
				  procedure or the one specified in RFC 3967.  This
				  specification does not impose a specific test or
				  requirement to determine
appropriateness. This is partially
				  because it would be impossible to do so for the
				  general case, but more so because the intention is to permit the
				  IESG and the community to balance the importance of
				  getting a source document published against the time
				  and difficulty associated with upgrading a target
				  document.  That requirement is intended to be less
				  stringent than the one of RFC 3967.  </t>
			   </section>
	  

    <section title="Security Considerations">
    <t> This document specifies an IETF procedure.  It is not believed
	   to raise any security issues although, in principle, relaxing
	   the normative downward reference rules for references
	   associated with security mechanisms could make a specification
	   less stable and hence less secure.
	   </t>
    </section>

	<section title="Acknowledgements" anchor="Acknowledgments">
    <t> This proposal was suggested by a comment by Spencer Dawkins
	   and many complaints about the negative impact of the current
	   rules.  The author is unsure about the validity of some of
	   those complaints; the proposal is, in part, a way to test the
	   validity question.  Spencer also provided helpful comments on a
	   preliminary version.  It was revised in response to extensive
	   discussion in the IESG and benefited significantly by comments
	   from Brian Carpenter.
