    <abstract>

      <t>This memo updates the process for selection of trustees for the IETF
      Trust. Previously, the Internet Administrative Oversight 
      Committee (IAOC) members also acted as trustees, but the IAOC 
      has been eliminated as part of an update to the structure of 
      the Internet Administrative Support Activity (IASA). This memo 
      specifies that the trustees shall be selected separately.</t>

      <t>This memo obsoletes RFC 4371.  The changes relate only
         to the selection of trustees. All other aspects of the IETF Trust
	 remain as they are today.

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>This memo updates the process for selection of trustees for the IETF
      Trust. Previously, the Internet Administrative Oversight 
      Committee (IAOC) members also acted as trustees, but the IAOC 
      has been eliminated as part of an update to the structure of 
      the Internet Administrative Support Activity (IASA). This memo 
      specifies that the trustees shall be selected separately. See <xref target="selection"/>.</t>    

      <t>This memo obsoletes RFC 4371.  The changes relate only to the
      selection of trustees.  All other aspects of the IETF Trust remain as
      they are today. <xref target="ietf-trust"/> copies the definition as it was in RFC 4371,
      only leaving out the part about trustee selection and adding a reference
      to the IETF Trust website.
</t>
      
      <t>For a discussion of why this change is needed and a rationale
      for these specific changes, see <xref

<section anchor="ietf-trust" title="IETF Trust">
<t>A Trust ("the IETF Trust") has been formed for the purpose of
   acquiring, holding, maintaining, and licensing certain existing and
   future intellectual property and other property used in connection
   with the administration of the IETF. The Trust was formed by the
   signatures of its Settlors and initial Trustees.  The Settlors, who
   contributed initial intellectual property to the Trust, were ISOC and
   the Corporation for National Research Initiatives. The Beneficiary
   of the IETF Trust is the IETF as a whole.</t>

<t>Further details of the IETF Trust may be found at the IETF Trust's
   website, &lt;https://trustee.ietf.org/&gt;.</t>

    <section anchor="selection" title="Selection of Trustees">
      
      <t>This document revises the original Trustee selection procedures
      defined in <xref target="RFC4071"/> and <xref target="RFC4371"/> 
      to eliminate the requirement that trustees be drawn from the 
      members of the IAOC.</t>  
	    
      <t>In this newly revised IETF Trust structure, there will be
      five Trustees.  Three shall be appointed by the IETF Nominating
      Committee (NomCom) and confirmed by the Internet Engineering
      Steering Group (IESG), one shall be appointed by the IESG, and
      one shall be appointed by the Internet Society (ISOC) Board of
      Trustees. The appointments by the IESG and the ISOC Board of
      Trustees do not require confirmation.</t>
      
      <t>The IETF Trust Chair informs the nominating committee
      of the Trustee positions to be reviewed. The IETF Trust will
      provide a summary of the expertise desired of the Trustee
      candidates to each appointing body.</t>
      
      <t>A change to the Trust Agreement is required to put this
      change into effect, and this document requests that the current
      Trustees make this change at the earliest convenient time and no
      later than the end of the 104th IETF meeting in March 2019.</t>
      
      <t>The terms of the appointed trustees from the IETF NomCom shall be
      three years.  The initial selection shall be one, two, and three
      year terms in order to initially stagger the terms. The other
      appointments by the IESG and the ISOC Board of Trustees shall be
      two year terms, with the initial terms being one and two years,
      respectively.
      The goal of the staggered initial terms is to minimize potential
      Trustee turnover in any single year. To maintain the
      staggered terms, each appointing body may, at its discretion,
      appoint Trustees for shorter terms as needed in exceptional
      situations, e.g., for mid-term vacancies or when an appointment
      is not ready by the time of the first IETF meeting of the year.</t>

      <t>Once the initial trustee selections according to the
      procedures in this document are complete, and at each subsequent
      annual meeting of the IETF Trust (once new trustees are seated),
      the trustees shall elect one trustee to serve as IETF Trust Chair by a
      majority vote of the IETF Trust.</t>

<!-- [rfced] We have udpated the text as requested in the RFC Editor
note.  Note that the text now refers to BCP 10, rather than
[I-D.ietf-iasa2-rfc7437bis].  Please let us know if any updates are required.  

Current: 
   Trustees appointed by the IETF NomCom may be recalled according to
   the recall process described in [BCP10].
   ... 

The RFC Editor Note says:

The RFC Editor is requested to make the following change in Section 2, which
has been discussed in the IASA2 WG:

OLD 
The processes regarding NomCom appointments and recalls of Trustees for the
IETF Trust follow those described in [RFC7437].  For the appointments by the
IESG, the IESG is expected to run an open selection process and to consider
the necessary skill set and conflicts of interest as part of that process.

NEW 
Trustees appointed by the IETF NomCom may be recalled according to the recall
process described in [BCP 10]. Trustees appointed by the IESG or by the ISOC
Board of Directors may be recalled by the appointing body.  For the
appointments by the IESG, the IESG is expected to run an open selection
process and to consider the necessary skill set and conflicts of interest as
part of that process.

-->
      
      <t>Trustees appointed by the IETF NomCom may be recalled according to
      the recall process described in <xref target="BCP10"/>. Trustees
      appointed by the IESG or by the ISOC Board of Directors may be recalled
      by the appointing body. For appointments made by the IESG, the IESG is
      expected to run an open selection process and to consider the necessary
      skill set and conflicts of interest as part of that process.</t>
