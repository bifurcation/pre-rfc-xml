	<abstract>
		<t> This document registers a trace field clause for use in
		    indicating transitions between handling queues or
		    processing states, including enacting inter- and
		    intra-host message transitions.  This might
		    include message quarantining, mailing list moderation,
		    timed delivery, queuing for further analysis, content
		    conversion, or other similar causes, as well as
		    optionally identifying normal handling queues. </t>

	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> <xref target="SMTP"/> defines the content of email
		    message trace fields, commonly the "Received" header field.
		    These are typically used to record an audit trail of
		    the path a message follows from origin to destination,
		    with one such field added each time a message moves from
		    one host to the next. </t>

		<t> Section 3.7.2 of that document
		    mentions that "the most important use of Received:
		    lines is for debugging mail faults [...]". </t>

		<t> There are some cases where there may be large time gaps
		    between trace fields.  Though this might be caused by
		    transient communication issues, they might also be caused
		    by policy decisions or special processing regarding the
		    content of the message, authorization of some
		    identity on the message, or transitions between major
		    software components.  Common examples include message
		    quarantines (filters that cause a message to be held pending
		    further evaluation or delivery of a message pending
		    manual operator action), pending content analysis, or
		    mailing list servers that impose moderation rules (mailing
		    list owner action required regarding mail from authors not
		    subscribed to those lists). </t>

		<t> This document registers a new optional clause that can be
		    used in trace fields to indicate that a message entered such
		    a special processing queue or state for some period.  This
		    allows inspection of the trace information to reveal that
		    the cause for a time gap in trace fields was imposed
		    by additional processing rather than one caused by
		    transient technical difficulties. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="keywords" title="Key Words">
		<t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
		    "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
		    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
		    interpreted as described in
		    <xref target="KEYWORDS"/>. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="clause" title="Trace Clause">
		<t> This specification defines a clause, called "state", which
		    MAY be used when creating a Received header field (see
		    Section 4.4 of <xref target="SMTP"/>) to indicate the
		    nature of additional handling imposed on the relaying
		    of a message toward its recipient(s).  It is followed by a
		    single keyword that provides that detail.  A Mail Transfer
		    Agent (MTA) or other handling agent that determines a
		    message has entered a state other than normal queuing of
		    messages for relaying or delivery MAY generate a trace
		    field including one of these clauses.  That is, the
		    presence of this clause on a trace field is an indication
		    of the entry of the message into that state; a later trace
		    field added would indicate its departure from that
		    state. </t>

		<t> An MTA implementing this specification SHOULD add a
		    Received field as described whenever:
		    <list style="letters">
			<t> It determines that a special handling condition
			    will occur and places it into that condition;
			    or </t>

			<t> It determines that no special handling is
			    required and prepares it for relay to the next
			    handling agent. </t>
		    </list> </t>

		<t> An MTA need not add a Received field indicating preparation
		    for normal handoff to the next handling agent if it has
		    already added a Received field for some other reason.
		    Trace data added by the next handling agent will imply
		    the message's exit from the special handling
		    condition. </t>

		<t> If a single MTA processes a message through multiple
		    special handling conditions, it MAY add a Received field for
		    each distinct condition. </t>

		<t> For example, presume a message will be injected into MTA-1,
		    then travel to MTA-3 via MTA-2, and then MTA-3 will enact
		    final delivery.  At MTA-2, it is determined that some
		    action will be taken that will cause the message to
		    undergo some handling change that is outside of typical
		    message flow.  In this case:
		    <list style="numbers">
			<t> MTA-1 adds a typical Received field and relays
			    it to MTA-2. </t>

			<t> MTA-2 determines that the atypical handling will
			    occur and adds a Received field using the
			    extension specified here. </t>

			<t> On completion of the atypical handling, MTA-2
			    relays the message to MTA-3. </t>

			<t> MTA-3 adds a typical Received field and enacts
			    final delivery of the message. </t>
		    </list> </t>

		<t> Appropriate use of this mechanism does not include
		    associating meta-data with the message, such as
		    categorizing the message (e.g., the notions of "is spam"
		    or "was 8-bit, converted to 7-bit").  Processing agents
		    also cannot reliably use this mechanism to determine
		    anything about the message content, since there is no
		    guarantee that all agents in the chain of handling made
		    such annotations to allow correct conclusions.  The sole
		    purpose here is to allow one to determine the point(s)
		    in the chain of custody of a message at which the message
		    was subjected to handling outside of normal message
		    routing and queuing. </t>

		<t> The following state keywords are defined in this document;
		    extensions may define other registered keywords (see
		    <xref target="iana_states"/>):

		    <list style="hanging">
			<t hangText="auth:"> The message entered a
				queue pending authentication of some
				identifier in the message. </t>

			<t hangText="content:"> The message entered a
				queue pending content analysis, such as
				scanning for spam or viruses. </t>

			<t hangText="convert:"> The message entered a
				queue pending content conversion. </t>

			<t hangText="moderation:"> The message entered a
				hold pending mailing list moderator
				action. </t>

			<t hangText="normal:"> The message is not in an
				administrative hold and is queued for or
				is being handed off to the next handling
				agent (which may be local delivery).  This is
				the default interpretation when no "state"
				clause is present. </t>

			<t hangText="other:"> The message entered a
				hold or queue for reasons not covered by other
				keywords in this list and not for
				transient technology issues. </t>

			<t hangText="outbound:"> The message entered a
				queue for outbound relaying.  This is
				typically the last case added for a single
				host, and the next Received header field is
				expected to be added by some other host. </t>

			<t hangText="quarantine:"> The message entered a
				hold in an isolation queue pending operator
				action for local policy reasons. </t>

			<t hangText="timed:"> The message entered a
				hold in order to meet a requested
				delivery window, such as is defined in
				<xref target="FUTURERELEASE"/>. </t>
		    </list> </t>


		<t> In <xref target="iana"/>, the "state" clause is added to
		    the Additional-Registered-Clauses IANA sub-registry.
		    The ABNF for this clause is:

		    <figure><artwork>
   State = CFWS "state" FWS queue-state-keyword [ "/" value ]

   queue-state-keyword = ( reg-state-keyword / unreg-state-keyword )

   reg-state-keyword = ( "auth" / "content" / "convert" /
                         "moderation" / "normal" / "other" / 
                         "outbound" / "quarantine" / "timed" /
                         additional-state-keyword )

   additional-state-keyword = token
                            ; MUST be registered; see
                            ; "IANA Considerations" below

   value = token

   unreg-state-keyword = token
		    </artwork></figure> </t>

		<t> "FWS" and "CFWS" are defined in <xref target="MAIL"/>.
		    "token" is defined in <xref target="MIME"/>. </t>

		<t> A transfer agent making use of this extension MAY also
		    include header field comments to provide additional
		    information. </t>

		<t> The "value" is available for providing additional labels as
		    explanation for the state transition.  Examples could
		    include:

			<list style="symbols">
				<t> convert/unicode2ascii </t>

				<t> moderation/not-subscribed </t>

				<t> quarantine/spam </t>
			</list> </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="discussion" title="Discussion">
		<t> Handling agents are not expected to implement or support
		    all of these.  Indeed, recording trace information for
		    all of the states described above could make the
		    header of a message inordinately large.  Rather, an agent
		    is encouraged to apply state annotations when a
		    message enters a handling queue where a significant
		    condition occurs or where significant additional
		    processing or delay is possible, and especially when a
		    handoff has occurred between two different, independent
		    agents. </t>

		<t> For example, an MTA receiving a message, doing message
		    authentication, scanning for viruses and spam, and then
		    putting it in an outbound queue could add four Received
		    header fields denoting each of these states.  However,
		    where they are all done as part of a single system process,
		    in a single pass, doing so would be considered unusual
		    (and extremely verbose).  This method SHOULD NOT be
		    applied except when doing detailed analysis of a single
		    component to identify performance issues with those
		    steps. </t>

		<t> Rather, an agent that wishes to make a state annotation
		    SHOULD add only a single Received header field including
		    such annotation, thus indicating (a) the time of completion
		    of its handling of the message via the date portion of the
		    field and (b) the final disposition of that message
		    relative to that agent.  For example, an MTA
		    receiving a message that performs various checks on
		    the message before immediately handing it off to a Mailing
		    List Manager (MLM) would only record a "normal" state,
		    assuming it passes those checks.  The MLM would then
		    evaluate the message and record its own state once it
		    decides what the next step will be for the handling of
		    that message. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="granularity" title="Granularity">
		<t> The degree of granularity -- and therefore the degree of
		    verbosity -- recorded through the use of this additional
		    trace clause is likely to vary depending on circumstances.
		    It will typically be the case that use of this clause will
		    be limited to "unusual" transitions, such as when a message
		    requires additional scrutiny or other processing or needs
		    to be quarantined. </t>

		<t> Somewhat greater granularity might also include
		    transitions of administrative responsibility, such as
		    between a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) operator and a
		    Mailing List Manager (MLM) operator.  This could be
		    further enhanced to note some transitions that are
		    interesting only when other transitions have occurred,
		    such as noting entry to the outbound queue only when the
		    message is originating from an "interesting" source, like
		    an MLM, since an MLM can introduce significant changes
		    to the message or delivery delay and it could be useful to
		    know when it completed its processing, as distinct from
		    the subsequent processing by the originating MTA.  In
		    circumstances needing very fine-grained trace information,
		    fields might be created to note all of these "significant"
		    network architecture transitions. </t>

		<t> One should note, however, when choosing higher levels
		    of granularity, that the Received header fields present
		    on a message could be counted by MTAs when trying to decide
		    whether or not a message routing loop is in effect.  A
		    message with an abundance of these might cause an incorrect
		    determination that the message is in a delivery loop,
		    causing it to be removed from the mail stream.  See
		    Section 6.3 of <xref target="SMTP"/> for further
		    discussion. </t>

			<t> The message passed from internal.example.com to
			    newyork.example.com intended for a mailing list
			    hosted at the latter.  For list administrative
			    reasons, the message is held there for moderation.
			    It is finally released over an hour later and
			    passed to the next host.  A comment after
			    the state expression indicates the actual cause
			    for the administrative hold. </t>
