<abstract>

<t>Three IPv4 unicast address blocks are reserved for use in examples
   in specifications and other documents.  This document describes the
   use of these blocks.</t>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

   <t>This document describes three IPv4 address blocks that are provided 
      for use in documentation.  The use of designated address ranges for
      documentation and examples reduces the likelihood of conflicts and
      confusion arising from the use of addresses assigned for some other
      purpose.</t>

   <t><xref target="RFC1166"/> reserves the first of the three address blocks,
      192.0.2.0/24.  The other two address blocks have recently been
      allocated for this purpose, primarily to ease the writing of examples involving
      addresses from multiple networks.</t>
   
   <t>Other documentation ranges have been defined in the IETF, including 
      the IPv6 documentation prefix <xref target="RFC3849"/> and example 
      domain names <xref target="RFC2606"/>. Documentation also makes use 
      of the ranges reserved in <xref target="RFC1918"/>.</t>

</section>

<section title="Terminology">
         
	<t>

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", 
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
interpreted as described in BCP 14, <xref target="RFC2119"/>.

	</t>

</section>

<section title="Documentation Address Blocks">

   <t>The blocks 192.0.2.0/24 (TEST-NET-1), 198.51.100.0/24
   (TEST-NET-2), and 203.0.113.0/24 (TEST-NET-3) are provided for use
   in documentation.
   </t>

</section>

<section title="Operational Implications">

   <t>Addresses within the TEST-NET-1, TEST-NET-2, and TEST-NET-3
   blocks SHOULD NOT appear on the public Internet and are used
   without any coordination with IANA or an Internet registry
   <xref target="RFC2050"/>.  Network operators SHOULD add these
   address blocks to the list of non-routeable address spaces, and if
   packet filters are deployed, then this address block SHOULD be
   added to packet filters.</t>

   <t>These blocks are not for local use, and the filters may be used
   in both local and public contexts.</t>

</section>

<section title="The Status of 128.66.0.0/16">

<t>

Note that 128.66.0.0/16 has been used for some examples in
the past. However, this block did not appear in the list of
special prefixes in <xref target="RFC3330"/> or its successors, and the block
is therefore not reserved for any special purpose. The block
can be used for regular address assignments with caution.
  
</t>

<section title='Security Considerations'>

   <t>This document has no security implications.</t>

</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">

   <t>IANA has recorded the allocation of the three address blocks in
   the IPv4 address registry. No end party is to be assigned these
   addresses.</t>
