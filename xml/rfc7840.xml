    <abstract>
      <t>For cases where location servers have access to emergency routing information, they are
      able to return routing information with the location information if the location
      request includes a request for the desired routing information. This document specifies
      an extension to the HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) protocol that updates RFC 5985 to support this function. Allowing
      location and routing information to be acquired in a single request response exchange
      updates RFC 6881, as current location acquisition and route determination 
      procedures are separate operations.

         The general 
Emergency Context Resolution with Internet Technology (ECRIT) calling models described in <xref target="RFC6443"/> 
         and <xref target="RFC6881"/> require a local Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) server or network of 
         forest guides in order to determine the address of the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) in the best 
         position to handle a call. Networks of forest guides have not materialized 
         and while PSAPs are moving towards IP networks, LoST server deployment is 
         not ubiquitous.  Some regions and countries have expressed reluctance to 
         deploy LoST servers making aspects of the current ECRIT architecture hard to 
         realize.
    </t>
    <t>
    	To address regulatory requirements, such as <xref target="M493"/>, evolving architectures in Europe couple 
        location and routing information in the access 
    	network while using a softswitch-centric approach to emergency call processing. 
    	This document describes an extension to the HELD protocol
   		<xref target="RFC5985"/>, so that a location
   		information server can provide emergency routing information in the absence 
   		of a LoST server or network of forest guides.

      <t>The Internet emergency calling architecture specified in <xref target="RFC6881"/> 
      describes two main models for emergency call processing. The first is a 
      device-centric model, where a device obtains location information using a location 
      configuration protocol, such as HELD <xref target="RFC5985"/>,
      and then proceeds to determine the address of the next hop closer to the local PSAP 
      using LoST <xref target="RFC5222"/>.
      <xref target="device"/> shows this model in a simplified form.

      <t>The second approach is a softswitch-centric model, where a device
      initiates an emergency call, and the serving softswitch detects that the call is an 
      emergency and initiates retrieving the caller's location from a LIS using HELD 
      <xref target="RFC5985"/> with identity 
      extensions <xref target="RFC6155"/> <xref target="RFC6915"/> and then determines
      the route to the  local PSAP using LoST <xref target="RFC5222"/>. 
      <xref target="sofswitch"/> shows the high-level protocol interactions.

<t>In the softswitch-centric model, when a VSP receives an emergency call, it performs two tasks. 
The first task is to determine the correct LIS to ask for location information; this is
done using a combination of reverse DNS lookup described in <xref target="RFC7216"/> to 
acquire the serving domain name and then using <xref target="RFC5986"/> to determine the
LIS URI. Once the location is obtained from the LIS, the VSP determines the LoST server
associated with the domain serving the caller and queries it for the correct PSAP address.</t>

<t>LoST server discovery is a domain-based activity, similar to the LIS discovery 
technique. However, unlike the LIS that is a domain-bound service, a LoST server is a 
geographically bound service. This means that for a domain that spans multiple geographic 
regions, the LoST server determined may not be able to provide a route to the necessary PSAP. 
When this occurs, the contacted LoST server invokes the help of other LoST servers, and 
this requires the deployment of forest guides.
</t>

<t>At the time of writing, several countries have expressed a reluctance to 
deploy public LoST servers. In countries amenable to the use of LoST and forest guides, no public 
forest guides have been deployed. There appears to be little interest from the public sector 
in establishing a global forest-guide network. These issues pose threats to
the ability of both the 
device-centric and the softswitch-centric calling approaches to operate
everywhere.
</t>

<t>The device-centric and softswitch-centric calling models both involve the notion of a 
LIS bound to the serving access network. In many cases, the LIS already knows the 
destination PSAP URI for any given location. In <xref target="RFC6881"/>, for example,
 the LIS validates civic locations using a location validation procedure based on the
 LoST protocol <xref target="RFC5222"/>. 
 The LoST validation request is similar to a LoST routing request and provides the LIS 
 with the same PSAP routing information that a routing request would.  
 In other cases, the LIS knows the correct PSAP for a given 
 location at provisioning time, or the access network might always route to the same 
 emergency provider. Irrespective of the way in which the LIS learns the PSAP URI 
 for a location, the LIS will, in a great many cases, already have this information.
</t>

<t>This document specifies an extension to the HELD protocol, so that emergency 
routing information can be requested from the LIS at the same time that location 
information is requested. This document updates <xref target="RFC6881"/> by requiring 
devices and softswitches that understand this specification to always request routing 
information to avoid the risk of query failure where no LoST server or forest-guide 
network is deployed.
</t>
	<section anchor="considerations" title="LoST Reuse Considerations">
<t>The LoST protocol <xref target="RFC5222"/> defines a &lt;mapping&gt; element that 
describes a service region and associated service URLs. Reusing this element from 
LoST to provide the routing URIs was considered. However, this would have meant that 
several of the mandatory components in the &lt;mapping&gt; element would have had to 
contain ambiguous or misleading values. Specifically, the &quot;source&quot; 
attribute is required to contain a LoST application-unique string for the authoritative server. However, in the situations
   described in this specification, there may not be an authoritative LoST server, so any
   value put into this attribute would be misleading. In addition to this, routing information
   received in the manner described in this specification should not be cached by the receiver,
   so detailing when the routing information expires or was last updated is irrelevant.   
</t>
</section>
      
    </section>
       

<section anchor="mechanism" title="Mechanism">
<t>
The mechanism consists of adding an element to the HELD locationRequest and an element 
to the locationResponse. 
</t>
<t>
The request element indicates that the requestor wants the LIS to provide routing
information based on the location of the end device.  
If the routing request is sent with no attribute, then URIs for urn:service:sos 
are returned.
If the requestor wants routing information for a specific service, then 
they may include an optional service URN. This service MUST exist in the IANA "Service URN Labels" repository created by <xref target="RFC5031"/>. If a service is specified, and the 
LIS does not understand the requested service, then URIs for urn:service:sos are returned.
</t>
<t>
If the LIS understands the routing request and has routing information for the location,
then it includes the information in a routingInformation element returned in the 
locationResponse. How the LIS obtains this information is left to implementation. 
Possibilities are described in <xref target="moti"/>.
</t>

<t>A LIS that does not understand the routing request element ignores it and returns 
the location information in the normal manner.
</t>

<t>A LIS that does support the routing request element MUST support returning URIs for
urn:service:sos and any regionally defined sub-services while following the URN traversal
rules defined in <xref target="RFC5031"/>.
</t>

<t>A LIS that does understand the routing request element but can't obtain any 
   routing information for the end-device's location MUST set the defaultRoute attribute to "true"
   and return a default PSAP or gateway URI along with the determined location information in
   the locationResponse.
</t>
<t>A LIS that understands the routing request element but not the specified 
service URN MUST follow the URN traversal rules defined in <xref target="RFC5031"/>.
</t>
<t>A LIS that receives a request for emergency routing information that it understands
   MUST return the correct emergency routing information if it has or is able to 
   acquire the routing information for the location of the target device.
</t> 

<t>The routing information in the location response consists of a service
element identified by a service name. The service name is a URN and might contain
a general emergency service URN such as urn:service:sos or a specific 
service URN depending on what was requested and what the LIS is able to provide. 
A list of one or more service destinations is provided for the service name. 
Each destination is expressed as a URI, and each URI scheme should only 
appear once in this list. The routing URIs are intended to be used at the time they are
received. To avoid any risks of using stale routing URIs, the values MUST NOT be 
cached by the receiving entity.

   <section anchor="updates" title="Modification to Phone BCP">
	<t>This section describes the normative updates to Phone BCP <xref target='RFC6881'/>.</t>

	<t>It is important for devices and intermediaries to take all steps possible to ensure 
	   that emergency calls are routed to the correct PSAP. An alternative to providing routing information
	   via global forest guides or local LoST servers is for local networks to configure the PSAP address 
	   information in the network location server. This specification updates
	   Phone BCP <xref target='RFC6881'/> to provide this option. 
	   The update requires devices and intermediaries
	   using the HELD protocol to always include the HELD routing extension. If the LIS 
	   is configured with the routing information, it can provide it; if
	   it is not, then the device or intermediary tries LoST to acquire the PSAP URI.
	</t>   
	<t>Section 6.5 of <xref target='RFC6881'/> defines &quot;End System Location Configuration&quot;.
	Requirement ED-23/INT-18/SP-14 is updated when HELD is used as the Location Configuration Protocol (LCP) such that 
	&quot;the request MUST include the requestRoutingInformation element.&quot; The remainder of the requirement
	remains unchanged.
	</t>
	<t>This document adds a new requirement to Section 7 of <xref target='RFC6881'/>.</t>
	<t>  &quot;ED-51a : Endpoints MUST support the HELD requestRoutingInformation element and be able
	   to interpret and use any routing information returned in the locationResponse.&quot;	
	</t>
	<t>This document adds two new requirements to Section 8 of <xref target='RFC6881'/>.</t> 
	<t>&quot;ED-52a : Endpoints that acquire routing information in a HELD locationResponse SHOULD use 
	this routing information but MAY perform a LoST findService request if they have a location value.&quot;
	</t>
	<t>&quot;ED-52b : Endpoints that acquire routing information in a HELD locationResponse with a
	defaultRoute attribute of "true" MUST perform a LoST findService request if they have a location value.
	If a route is provided by the LoST server, then this route MUST be used, otherwise the routing
	information provided in the HELD response SHOULD be used.&quot;
	</t>
	
	<t>This document amends SP-26 from Section 8 of <xref target='RFC6881'/> such that
	   a LoST mapping need not be requested if non-default routing information is provided in the
	   HELD locationResponse.

      <t>This document makes no changes that require privacy considerations beyond those

      described in <xref target="RFC6155"/>.

      <t><xref target="RFC5985"/> describes the privacy considerations surrounding the HELD location configuration
      protocol, and this document makes no specific changes to these considerations.</t>
      <t><xref target="RFC6155"/> extends HELD beyond a simple LCP by enabling authorized 
      third parties to acquire location information and describing the issues in <xref target="mechanism"/>.
      The HELD routing extension supports returning URIs that represent specific services
      operating in the Target's vicinity. This represents additional information about the
      Target; as a consequence, it is recommended that this option only be used when the LIS
      returns a location URI, not a location value.
