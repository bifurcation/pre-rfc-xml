  <abstract> 

    <t>This document describes anonymization techniques for IP flow data and
    the export of anonymized data using the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) protocol. It categorizes
    common anonymization schemes and defines the parameters needed to describe
    them. It provides guidelines for the implementation of anonymized data
    export and storage over IPFIX, and describes an information model and
    Options-based method for anonymization metadata export within the IPFIX
    protocol or storage in IPFIX Files.</t>

  <section title="Introduction">

    <t>The standardization of an IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) protocol <xref
    target="RFC5101"/> and associated representations removes a technical
    barrier to the sharing of IP flow data across organizational boundaries
    and with network operations, security, and research communities for a wide
    variety of purposes. However, with wider dissemination comes greater risks
    to the privacy of the users of networks under measurement, and to the
    security of those networks. While it is not a complete solution to the
    issues posed by distribution of IP flow information, anonymization (i.e.,
    the deletion or transformation of information that is considered sensitive
    and that could be used to reveal the identity of subjects involved in a
    communication) is an important tool for the protection of privacy within
    network measurement infrastructures.</t>

    <t>This document presents a mechanism for representing anonymized data
    within IPFIX and guidelines for using it. It is not intended as a general
    statement on the applicability of specific flow data anonymization
    techniques to specific situations or as a recommendation of any
    particular application of anonymization to flow data export. Exporters or
    publishers of anonymized data must take care that the applied
    anonymization technique is appropriate for the data source, the purpose,
    and the risk of deanonymization of a given application.</t>

    <t>It begins with a categorization of anonymization techniques. It then
    describes the applicability of each technique to commonly anonymizable fields
    of IP flow data, organized by information element data type and semantics
    as in <xref target="RFC5102"></xref>; enumerates the parameters required
    by each of the applicable anonymization techniques; and provides
    guidelines for the use of each of these techniques in accordance with
    current best practices in data protection. Finally, it specifies a
    mechanism for exporting anonymized data and binding anonymization metadata
    to Templates and Options Templates using IPFIX Options.</t>

    <section title="IPFIX Protocol Overview">

      <t>In the IPFIX protocol, { type, length, value } tuples are expressed
      in Templates containing { type, length } pairs, specifying which { value
      } fields are present in data records conforming to the Template, giving
      great flexibility as to what data is transmitted. Since Templates are
      sent very infrequently compared with Data Records, this results in
      significant bandwidth savings. Various different data formats may be
      transmitted simply by sending new Templates specifying the { type,
      length } pairs for the new data format. See <xref target="RFC5101"></xref> for more information.</t>

      <t>The <xref target="RFC5102">IPFIX information model</xref> defines a
      large number of standard Information Elements (IEs) that provide the
      necessary { type } information for Templates. The use of standard
      elements enables interoperability among different vendors'
      implementations. Additionally, non-standard enterprise-specific elements
      may be defined for private use.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="IPFIX Documents Overview" anchor="intro-docs">

      <t><xref target="RFC5101">"Specification of the IP Flow Information
Export (IPFIX) Protocol for the Exchange of IP Traffic Flow Information"</xref>
      and its associated documents
      define the IPFIX protocol, which provides network engineers and
      administrators with access to IP traffic flow information.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC5470">"Architecture for IP Flow
      Information Export"</xref> defines
      the architecture for the export of measured IP flow information out of
      an IPFIX Exporting Process to an IPFIX Collecting Process, and the
      basic terminology used to describe the elements of this architecture,
      per the requirements defined in <xref target="RFC3917">"Requirements
      for IP Flow Information Export"</xref>. The IPFIX Protocol document
      <xref target="RFC5101"></xref> then covers the details of the method for
      transporting IPFIX Data Records and Templates via a congestion-aware
      transport protocol from an IPFIX Exporting Process to an IPFIX
      Collecting Process.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC5102">"Information Model for IP Flow Information
      Export"</xref> describes the Information Elements used by IPFIX,
      including details on Information Element naming, numbering, and data
      type encoding. Finally, <xref target="RFC5472">"IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
      Applicability"</xref> describes the various applications of the IPFIX
      protocol and their use of information exported via IPFIX and relates
      the IPFIX architecture to other measurement architectures and
      frameworks.</t>

      <t>Additionally, <xref target="RFC5655">"Specification
      of the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) File Format"</xref> describes a file format based upon the
      IPFIX protocol for the storage of flow data.</t>

      <t>This document references the Protocol and Architecture documents for
      terminology and extends the IPFIX Information Model to provide new
      Information Elements for anonymization metadata. The anonymization
      techniques described herein are equally applicable to the IPFIX protocol
      and data stored in IPFIX Files.</t>

    </section>
    
    <section title="Anonymization within the IPFIX Architecture" anchor="intro-arch">

      <t>According to <xref target="RFC5470"/>, IPFIX Message anonymization is
      optionally performed as the final operation before handing the Message
      to the transport protocol for export. While no provision is made in the
      architecture for anonymization metadata as in <xref
      target="aes-section"></xref>, this arrangement does allow for the
      rewriting necessary for comprehensive anonymization of IPFIX
      export as in <xref target="export-anon-section"></xref>. The development
      of the <xref target="RFC6183">IPFIX
      Mediation</xref> framework and the <xref target="RFC5655">IPFIX File
      Format</xref> expand upon this initial architectural allowance for
      anonymization by adding to the list of places that anonymization may be
      applied. The former specifies IPFIX Mediators, which rewrite existing
      IPFIX Messages, and the latter specifies a method for storage of IPFIX
      data in files.</t>
      
       <t>More detail on the applicable architectural arrangements for
      anonymization can be found in <xref
      target="export-anon-arrangement"></xref></t>.

	<section title="Supporting Experimentation with Anonymization">

        <t>The status of this document is Experimental, reflecting
        the experimental nature of anonymization export support. Research on
        network trace anonymization techniques and attacks against them is
        ongoing. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that anonymization
        applied to network trace or flow data on its own is insufficient for many
        data protection applications as in <xref target="Bur10"/>. Therefore,
        this document explicitly does not recommend any particular technique
        or implementation thereof.</t>

        <t>The intention of this document is to provide a common basis for
        interoperable exchange of anonymized data, furthering research in this
        area, both on anonymization techniques themselves as well as to the
        application of anonymized data to network measurement. To that end,
        the classification in <xref target="cat-section"/> and
        anonymization export support in <xref target="aes-section"/>
        can be used to describe and export information even about data
        anonymized using techniques that are unacceptably weak for general
        application to production datasets on their own.</t>

         <t>While the specification herein is designed to be independent of
         the anonymization techniques applied and the implementation thereof,
         open research in this area may necessitate future updates to the
         specification. Assuming the future successful application of this
         specification to anonymized data publication and exchange, it may be
         brought back to the IPFIX working group for further development and
         publication on the Standards Track.</t>

  <section title="Terminology">

    <t>Terms used in this document that are defined in the Terminology section
    of the <xref target="RFC5101">IPFIX Protocol</xref> document are to be
    interpreted as defined there. In addition, this document defines the
    following terms:</t>

    <list style="hanging"> 

      <t hangText="Anonymization Record: ">A record, defined by the
      Anonymization Options Template in <xref target="opt-section"/>,
      that defines the properties of the anonymization applied to a single
      Information Element within a single Template or Options Template.</t>

      <t hangText="Anonymized Data Record: ">A Data Record within a Data Set
      containing at least one Information Element with anonymized values. The
      Information Element(s) within the Template or Options Template
      describing this Data Record SHOULD have a corresponding Anonymization
      Record.</t>

      <t hangText="Intermediate Anonymization Process: ">An intermediate
      process that takes Data Records and transforms them into Anonymized
      Data Records.</t>

    </list>

    <t>Note that there is an explicit difference in this document between a
    "Data Set" (which is defined as in <xref target="RFC5101"/>) and a "data
    set". When in lower case, this term refers to any collection of data
    (usually, within the context of this document, flow or packet data) that
    may contain identifying information and is therefore subject to
    anonymization.</t>


    <t>Note also that when the term Template is used in this document, unless
    otherwise noted, it applies both to Templates and Options Templates as
    defined in <xref target="RFC5101"/>. Specifically, Anonymization Records
    may apply to both Templates and Options Templates.</t>

    <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

  <section title="Categorization of Anonymization Techniques" anchor="cat-section">

    <t>Anonymization, as described by this document, is the modification of a
    dataset in order to protect the identity of the people or entities
    described by the dataset from disclosure. With respect to network traffic
    data, anonymization generally attempts to preserve some set of properties
    of the network traffic useful for a given application or applications,
    while ensuring the data cannot be traced back to the specific networks,
    hosts, or users generating the traffic.</t>

    <t>Anonymization may be broadly classified according to two properties:
    recoverability and countability. All anonymization techniques map the real
    space of identifiers or values into a separate, anonymized space,
    according to some function. A technique is said to be recoverable when the
    function used is invertible or can otherwise be reversed and a real
    identifier can be recovered from a given replacement identifier.
    "Recoverability" as used within this categorization does not refer to
    recoverability under attack; that is, techniques wherein the function used
    can only be reversed using additional information, such as an encryption
    key, or knowledge of injected traffic within the dataset, are not
    considered to be recoverable.</t>


    <t>Countability compares the dimension of the anonymized space (N) to the
    dimension of the real space (M), and denotes how the count of unique
    values is preserved by the anonymization function. If the anonymized space
    is smaller than the real space, then the function is said to generalize
    the input, mapping more than one input point to each anonymous value
    (e.g., as with aggregation). By definition, generalization is not
    recoverable.</t>

    <t>If the dimensions of the anonymized and real spaces are the same, such
    that the count of unique values is preserved, then the function is said to
    be a direct substitution function. If the dimension of the anonymized
    space is larger, such that each real value maps to a set of anonymized
    values, then the function is said to be a set substitution function. Note
    that with set substitution functions, the sets of anonymized values are
    not necessarily disjoint. Either direct or set substitution functions are
    said to be one-way if there exists no non-brute force method for
    recovering the real data point from an anonymized one in isolation (i.e.,
    if the only way to recover the data point is to attack the anonymized data
    set as a whole, e.g., through fingerprinting or data injection).</t>

    <t>This classification is summarized in the table below.</t>

  <section title="Anonymization of IP Flow Data">



   <t>In anonymizing IP flow data as treated by this document, the goal is
   generally two-way address untraceability: to remove the ability to assert
   that endpoint X contacted endpoint Y at time T.&nbsp; Address untraceability is
   important as IP addresses are the most suitable field in IP flow records to
   identify real-world entities. Each IP address is associated with an
   interface on a network host and can potentially be identified with a
   single user. Additionally, IP addresses are structured identifiers; that
   is, partial IP address prefixes may be used to identify networks just as
   full IP addresses identify hosts. This leads IP flow data anonymization to
   be concerned first and foremost with IP address anonymization.</t>

   <t>Any form of aggregation that combines flows from multiple endpoints
   into a single record (e.g., aggregation by subnetwork, aggregation removing
   addressing completely) may also provide address untraceability; however,
   anonymization by aggregation is out of scope for this document.
   Additionally, of potential interest in this problem space but out of scope
   are anonymization techniques that are applied over multiple fields or
   multiple records in a way that introduces dependencies among anonymized
   fields or records. This document is concerned solely with anonymization
   techniques applied at the resolution of single fields within a flow
   record.</t>

    <t>Even so, attacks against these anonymization techniques use entire
    flows and relationships between hosts and flows within a given dataset.
    Therefore, fields that may not necessarily be identifying by themselves
    may be anonymized in order to increase the anonymity of the dataset as a
    whole.</t>

    <t>Due to the restricted semantics of IP flow data, there is a relatively
    limited set of specific anonymization techniques available on flow data,
    though each falls into the broad categories discussed in the previous
    section. Each type of field that may commonly appear in a flow record may
    have its own applicable specific techniques.</t>

    <t>As with IP addresses, Media Access Control (MAC) addresses uniquely identify devices on the
    network; while they are not often available in traffic data collected at
    Layer 3, and cannot be used to locate devices within the network, some
    traces may contain sub-IP data including MAC address data. Hardware
    addresses may be mappable to device serial numbers, and to the entities or
    individuals who purchased the devices, when combined with external
    databases. MAC addresses are also often used in constructing IPv6
    addresses (see Section 2.5.1 of <xref target="RFC4291"/>) and as such may
    be used to reconstruct the low-order bits of anonymized IPv6 addresses in
    certain circumstances. Therefore, MAC address anonymization is also
    important.</t>

    <t>Port numbers identify abstract entities (applications) as opposed to
    real-world entities, but they can be used to classify hosts and user
    behavior. Passive port fingerprinting, both of well-known and ephemeral
    ports, can be used to determine the operating system running on a host.
    Relative data volumes by port can also be used to determine the host's
    function (workstation, web server, etc.); this information can be used to
    identify hosts and users.</t>

    <t>While not identifiers in and of themselves, timestamps and counters
    can reveal the behavior of the hosts and users on a network. Any given
    network activity is recognizable by a pattern of relative time differences
    and data volumes in the associated sequence of flows, even without host
    address information. Therefore, they can be used to identify hosts and
    users. Timestamps and counters are also vulnerable to traffic injection
    attacks, where traffic with a known pattern is injected into a network
    under measurement, and this pattern is later identified in the anonymized
    dataset. </t>

    <t>The simplest and most extreme form of anonymization, which can be
    applied to any field of a flow record, is black-marker anonymization, or
    complete deletion of a given field. Note that black-marker anonymization
    is equivalent to simply not exporting the field(s) in question.</t>

    <t> While black-marker anonymization completely protects the data in
    the deleted fields from the risk of disclosure, it also reduces the
    utility of the anonymized dataset as a whole. Techniques that retain some
    information while reducing (though not eliminating) the disclosure risk
    will be extensively discussed in the following sections; note that the
    techniques specifically applicable to IP addresses, timestamps, ports, and
    counters will be discussed in separate sections.</t>

    <section title="IP Address Anonymization">

      <t>Since IP addresses are the most common identifiers within flow data
      that can be used to directly identify a person, organization, or host,
      most of the work on flow and trace data anonymization has gone into IP
      address anonymization techniques. Indeed, the aim of most attacks
      against anonymization is to recover the map from anonymized IP addresses
      to original IP addresses thereby identifying the identified hosts. Therefore, there
      is a wide range of IP address anonymization schemes that fit
      into the following categories.</t>

      <texttable> 
        <ttcol align="left">Scheme</ttcol> 
        <ttcol align="left">Action</ttcol> 
        <c>Truncation</c><c>Generalization</c>
        <c>Reverse Truncation</c><c >Generalization</c>
        <c>Permutation</c><c>Direct Substitution</c>
        <c>Prefix-preserving Pseudonymization</c><c>Direct Substitution</c>
      </texttable>

      <section title="Truncation">

        <t>Truncation removes "n" of the least significant bits from an IP
        address, replacing them with zeroes. In effect, it replaces a host
        address with a network address for some fixed netblock; for IPv4
        addresses, 8-bit truncation corresponds to replacement with a /24
        network address. Truncation is a non-reversible generalization scheme.
        Note that while truncation is effective for making hosts
        non-identifiable, it preserves information that can be used to
        identify an organization, a geographic region, a country, or a
        continent.</t>

        <t>Truncation to an address length of 0 is equivalent to black-marker
        anonymization. Complete removal of IP address information is only
        recommended for analysis tasks that have no need to separate flow
        data by host or network; e.g., as a first stage to per-application
        (port) or time-series total volume analyses.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Reverse Truncation">

        <t>Reverse truncation removes "n" of the most significant bits from an
        IP address, replacing them with zeroes. Reverse truncation is a
        non-reversible generalization scheme. Reverse truncation is effective
        for making networks unidentifiable, partially or completely removing
        information that can be used to identify an organization, a
        geographic region, a country, or a continent (or Regional Internet Registry (RIR) region of
        responsibility). However, it may cause ambiguity when applied to data
        collected from more than one network, since it treats all the hosts
        with the same address on different networks as if they are the same
        host. It is not particularly useful when publishing data where the
        network of origin is known or can be easily guessed by virtue of the
        identity of the publisher.</t>

        <t>Like truncation, reverse truncation to an address length of 0 is
        equivalent to black-marker anonymization.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Permutation">

        <t>Permutation is a direct substitution technique, replacing each IP
        address with an address selected from the set of possible IP
        addresses, such that each anonymized address represents a
        unique original address. The selection function is often random,
        though it is not necessarily so. Permutation does not preserve any
        structural information about a network, but it does preserve the
        unique count of IP addresses. Any application that requires more
        structure than host-uniqueness will not be able to use permuted IP
        addresses.</t>

        <t>There are many variations of permutation functions, each of which
        has trade-offs in performance, security, and guarantees of
        non-collision; evaluating these trade-offs is implementation
        independent. However, in general, permutation functions applied to
        anonymization SHOULD be difficult to reverse without knowing the
        parameters (e.g., a secret key for Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC). Given the relatively small
        space of IPv4 addresses in particular, hash functions applied without
        additional parameters could be reversed through brute force if the
        hash function is known, and SHOULD NOT be used as permutation
        functions. Permutation functions may guarantee non-collision (i.e.,
        that each anonymized address represents a unique original address),
        but need not; however, the probability of collision SHOULD be low. Nevertheless, we
        treat even permutations with low but nonzero collision probability as
        a direct substitution. Beyond these guidelines,
        recommendations for specific permutation functions are out of scope
        for this document.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Prefix-Preserving Pseudonymization">

        <t>Prefix-preserving pseudonymization is a direct substitution
        technique, like permutation but further restricted such that the
        structure of subnets is preserved at each level while anonymizing IP
        addresses. If two real IP addresses match on a prefix of "n" bits, the
        two anonymized IP addresses will match on a prefix of "n" bits as
        well. This is useful when relationships among networks must be
        preserved for a given analysis task, but introduces structure into the
        anonymized data that can be exploited in attacks against the
        anonymization technique.</t>

        <t>Scanning in Internet background traffic can cause particular
        problems with this technique: if a scanner uses a predictable and
        known sequence of addresses, this information can be used to reverse
        the substitution. The low-order portion of the address can be left
        unanonymized as a partial defense against this attack.</t>

      </section>
        
    </section>

    <section title="MAC Address Anonymization">

      <t>Flow data containing sub-IP information can also contain identifying
      information in the form of the hardware (MAC) address. While MAC
      address information cannot be used to locate a node within a network, it
      can be used to directly and uniquely identify a specific device. Vendors or
      organizations within the supply chain may then have the information
      necessary to identify the entity or individual that purchased the
      device.</t>

      <t>MAC address information is not as structured as IP address
      information. EUI-48 and EUI-64 MAC addresses contain an Organizational
      Unique Identifier (OUI) in the three most significant bytes of the
      address; this OUI additionally contains bits noting whether the address
      is locally or globally administered. Beyond this, there is no standard
      relationship among the OUIs assigned to a given vendor.</t>

      <t>Note that MAC address information also appears within IPv6
      addresses as the EAP-64 address, or EAP-48 address encoded as an EAP-64

      <section title="Truncation">

         <t>Truncation removes "n" of the least significant bits from a MAC
         address, replacing them with zeroes. In effect, it retains bits of
         OUI, which identifies the manufacturer, while removing the least
         significant bits identifying the particular device. Truncation of 24
         bits of an EAP-48 or 40 bits of an EAP-64 address zeroes out the
         device identifier while retaining the OUI.</t>

         <t>Truncation is effective for making device manufacturers partially
         or completely identifiable within a dataset while deleting unique
         host identifiers; this can be used to retain and aggregate MAC-layer
         behavior by vendor.</t>
         
          <t>Truncation to an address length of 0 is equivalent to

      <section title="Reverse Truncation">

        <t>Reverse truncation removes "n" of the most significant bits from a
        MAC address, replacing them with zeroes. Reverse truncation is a
        non-reversible generalization scheme. This has the effect of removing
        bits of the OUI, which identify manufacturers, before removing the
        least significant bits. Reverse truncation of 24 bits zeroes out the
        OUI.</t>

        <t>Reverse truncation is effective for making device manufacturers
        partially or completely unidentifiable within a dataset. However, it
        may cause ambiguity by introducing the possibility of truncated MAC
        address collision. Also, note that the utility of removing manufacturer
        information is not particularly well covered by the literature.</t>

        <t>Reverse truncation to an address length of 0 is
        equivalent to black-marker anonymization.</t>

      <section title="Permutation">

        <t>Permutation is a direct substitution technique, replacing each
        MAC address with an address selected from the set of possible
        MAC addresses, such that each anonymized address
        represents a unique original address. The selection function is often
        random, though it is not necessarily so. Permutation does not preserve
        any structural information about a network, but it does preserve the
        unique count of devices on the network. Any application that requires
        more structure than host-uniqueness will not be able to use permuted
        MAC addresses.</t>

        <t>There are many variations of permutation functions, each of which
        has trade-offs in performance, security, and guarantees of
        non-collision; evaluating these trade-offs is implementation
        independent. However, in general, permutation functions applied to
        anonymization SHOULD be difficult to reverse without knowing the
        parameters (e.g., a secret key for HMAC). While the EAP-48 space is
        larger than the IPv4 address space, hash functions applied without
        additional parameters could be reversed through brute force if the
        hash function is known, and SHOULD NOT be used as permutation
        functions. Permutation functions may guarantee non-collision (i.e.,
        that each anonymized address represents a unique original address),
        but need not; however, the probability of collision SHOULD be low. Nevertheless, we
        treat even permutations with low but nonzero collision probability as
        a direct substitution. Beyond these guidelines,
        recommendations for specific permutation functions are out of scope
        for this document.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Structured Pseudonymization">

        <t>Structured pseudonymization for MAC addresses is a direct
        substitution technique, like permutation, but restricted such
        that the OUI (the most significant three bytes) is permuted separately
        from the node identifier, the remainder. This is useful when the
        uniqueness of OUIs must be preserved for a given analysis task, but
        introduces structure into the anonymized data that can be exploited
        in attacks against the anonymization technique.</t>

    <section title="Timestamp Anonymization">

      <t>The particular time at which a flow began or ended is not
      particularly identifiable information, but it can be used as part of
      attacks against other anonymization techniques or for user profiling,
      e.g., as in <xref target="Mur07"/>. Timestamps can be used in traffic
      injection attacks, which use known information about a set of traffic
      generated or otherwise known by an attacker to recover mappings of other
      anonymized fields, as well as to identify certain activity by response
      delay and size fingerprinting, which compares response sizes and
      inter-flow times in anonymized data to known values. Note that these
      attacks have been shown to be relatively robust against timestamp
      anonymization techniques (see <xref target="Bur10"/>), so the techniques
      presented in this section are relatively weak and should be used with
      care.</t>

      <section title="Precision Degradation">

        <t>Precision Degradation is a generalization technique that removes
        the most precise components of a timestamp, accounting for all events
        occurring in each given interval (e.g., one millisecond for millisecond
        level degradation) as simultaneous. This has the effect of potentially
        collapsing many timestamps into one. With this technique, time
        precision is reduced and sequencing may be lost, but the information regarding
        at which time the event occurred is preserved. The anonymized data may
        not be generally useful for applications that require strict
        sequencing of flows.</t>

        <t>Note that flow meters with low time precision (e.g., second
        precision, or millisecond precision on high-capacity networks) perform
        the equivalent of precision degradation anonymization by their
        design.</t>

        <t>Also, note that degradation to a very low precision (e.g., on the
        order of minutes, hours, or days) is commonly used in analyses
        operating on time-series aggregated data, and may also be described as
        binning; though the time scales are longer and applicability more
        restricted, in principle, this is the same operation.</t>

        <t>Precision degradation to infinitely low precision is equivalent to
        black-marker anonymization. Removal of timestamp information is only
        recommended for analysis tasks that have no need to separate flows in
        time, for example, for counting total volumes or unique occurrences of
        other flow keys in an entire dataset.</t>

      </section>
      
      <section title="Enumeration">

        <t>Enumeration is a substitution function that retains the
        chronological order in which events occurred while eliminating time
        information. Timestamps are substituted by equidistant timestamps (or
        numbers) starting from a randomly chosen start value. The resulting
        data is useful for applications requiring strict sequencing, but not
        for those requiring good timing information (e.g., delay- or jitter-
        measurement for quality-of-service (QoS) applications or service-level
        agreement (SLA) validation).</t>

        <t>Note that enumeration is functionally equivalent to precision
        degradation in any environment into which traffic can be regularly
        injected to serve as a clock at the precision of the frequency of the
        injected flows.</t>

      </section>
      
      <section title="Random Shifts">

        <t>Random time shifts add a random offset to every timestamp within a
        dataset. Therefore, this reversible substitution technique retains
        duration and inter-event interval information as well as the chronological
        order of flows. Random time shifts are quite weak and relatively easy
        to reverse in the presence of external knowledge about traffic on the
        measured network.</t>

         </section>

    <section title="Counter Anonymization">

      <t>Counters (such as packet and octet volumes per flow) are subject to
      fingerprinting and injection attacks against anonymization or for user
      profiling as timestamps are. Data sets with anonymized counters are
      useful only for analysis tasks for which relative or imprecise
      magnitudes of activity are useful. Counter information can also be
      completely removed, but this is only recommended for analysis tasks
      that have no need to evaluate the removed counter, for example, for
      counting only unique occurrences of other flow keys.</t>

      </texttable>

      <section title="Precision Degradation">

        <t>As with precision degradation in timestamps, precision degradation
        of counters removes lower-order bits of the counters, treating all the
        counters in a given range as having the same value. Depending on the
        precision reduction, this loses information about the relationships
        between sizes of similarly sized flows, but keeps relative magnitude
        information. Precision degradation to an infinitely low precision is
        equivalent to black-marker anonymization.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Binning">

        <t>Binning can be seen as a special case of precision degradation; the
        operation is identical, except for in precision degradation the
        counter ranges are uniform, and in binning, they need not be. For
        example, consider separating unopened TCP connections from potentially
        opened TCP connections. Here, packet counters per flow would be binned
        into two bins, one for 1-2 packet flows, and one for flows with 3 or
        more packets. Binning schemes are generally chosen to keep precisely
        the amount of information required in a counter for a given analysis
        task. Note that, also unlike precision degradation, the bin label need
        not be within the bin's range. Binning counters to a single bin is
        equivalent to black-marker anonymization. </t>

      </section>

      <section title="Random Noise Addition">

        <t>Random noise addition adds a random amount to a counter in each
        flow; this is used to keep relative magnitude information and minimize
        the disruption to size relationship information while avoiding
        fingerprinting attacks against anonymization. Note that there is no
        guarantee that random noise addition will maintain ranking order by a
        counter among members of a set. Random noise addition is particularly
        useful when the derived analysis data will not be presented in such a
        way as to require the lower-order bits of the counters.</t>

    <section title="Anonymization of Other Flow Fields">

      <t>Other fields, particularly port numbers and protocol numbers, can
      be used to partially identify the applications that generated the
      traffic in a given flow trace. This information can be used in
      fingerprinting attacks, and may be of interest on its own (e.g., to
      reveal that a certain application with suspected vulnerabilities is
      running on a given network). These fields are generally
      anonymized using one of two techniques.</t>

      <section title="Binning">

        <t>Binning is a generalization technique mapping a set of potentially
        non-uniform ranges into a set of arbitrarily labeled bins. Common bin
        arrangements depend on the field type and the analysis application.
        For example, an IP protocol bin arrangement may preserve 1, 6, and 17
        for ICMP, UDP, and TCP traffic, and bin all other protocols into a
        single bin, to mitigate the use of uncommon protocols in
        fingerprinting attacks. Another example arrangement may bin source and
        destination ports into low (0-1023) and high (1024-65535) bins in
        order to tell service from ephemeral ports without identifying
        individual applications.</t>

        <t>Binning other flow key fields to a single bin is equivalent to
        black-marker anonymization. Removal of other flow key information is
        only recommended for analysis tasks that have no need to
        differentiate flows on the removed keys, for example, for total traffic
        counts or unique counts of other flow keys.</t>

      </section>      

      <section title="Permutation">

        <t>Permutation is a direct substitution technique, replacing
        each value with an value selected from the set of possible
        range, such that each anonymized value represents a unique
        original value. This is used to preserve the count of unique values
        without preserving information about, or the ordering of, the values
        themselves.</t>

        <t>While permutation ideally guarantees that each anonymized value
        represents a unique original value, such may require significant state
        in the Intermediate Anonymization Process. Therefore, permutation may
        be implemented by hashing for performance reasons, with hash functions
        that may have relatively small collision probabilities. Such
        techniques are still essentially direct substitution techniques,
        despite the nonzero error probability.</t>

  <section title="Parameters for the Description of Anonymization Techniques"> 

    <t>This section details the abstract parameters used to describe the
    anonymization techniques examined in the previous section, on a
    per-parameter basis. These parameters and their export safety inform the
    design of the IPFIX anonymization metadata export specified in the
    following section.</t>

    <section title="Stability" anchor="params-stability">

      <t>A stable anonymization will always map a given value in the real
      space to a given value in the anonymized space, while an unstable
      anonymization will change this mapping over time; a completely unstable
      anonymization is essentially indistinguishable from black-marker
      anonymization. Any given anonymization technique may be applied with a
      varying range of stability. Stability is important for assessing the
      comparability of anonymized information in different datasets, or in
      the same dataset over different time periods. In practice, an
      anonymization may also be stable for every dataset published by a
      particular producer to a particular consumer, stable for a stated time
      period within a dataset or across datasets, or stable only for a single
      dataset.</t>

      <t>If no information about stability is available, users of anonymized
      data MAY assume that the techniques used are stable across the entire
      dataset, but unstable across datasets. Note that stability presents a
      risk-utility trade-off, as completely stable anonymization can be used
      for longer-term trend analysis tasks but also presents more risk of
      attack given the stable mapping. Information about the stability of
      a mapping SHOULD be exported along with the anonymized data.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Truncation Length">

      <t>Truncation and precision degradation are described by the truncation
      length or the amount of data still remaining in the anonymized field
      after anonymization.</t>

      <t>Truncation length can generally be inferred from a given dataset,
      and need not be specially exported or protected. For bit-level
      truncation, the truncated bits are generally inferable by the least
      significant bit set for an instance of an Information Element described
      by a given Template (or the most significant bit set, in the case of
      reverse truncation). For precision degradation, the truncation is
      inferable from the maximum precision given. Note that while this
      inference method is generally applicable, it is data dependent: there is
      no guarantee that it will recover the exact truncation length used to
      prepare the data.</t>

      <t>In the special case of IP address export with variable (per-record)
      truncation, the truncation MAY be expressed by exporting the prefix
      length alongside the address.</t>

    </section>
    
    <section title="Bin Map">

      <t>Binning is described by the specification of a bin mapping function.
      This function can be generally expressed in terms of an associative
      array that maps each point in the original space to a bin, although from
      an implementation standpoint most bin functions are much simpler and
      more efficient.</t>

      <t>Since the bin map for a bin mapping function is in essence the bin
      mapping key, and can be used to partially deanonymize binned data,
      depending on the degree of generalization, information about the bin
      mapping function SHOULD NOT be exported.</t>
      
       </section>
      
       <section title="Permutation">

      <t>Like binning, permutation is described by the specification of a
      permutation function. In the general case, this can be expressed in
      terms of an associative array that maps each point in the original space
      to a point in the anonymized space. Unlike binning, each point in the
      anonymized space corresponds to a single, unique point in the
      original space.</t>

      <t>Since the parameters of the permutation function are in essence
      key-like (indeed, for cryptographic permutation functions, they are the
      keys themselves), information about the permutation function or its
      parameters SHOULD NOT be exported.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Shift Amount">

      <t>Shifting requires an amount by which to shift each value. Since the shift
      amount is the only key to a shift function, and can be used to trivially
      deanonymize data protected by shifting, information about the shift
      amount SHOULD NOT be exported.</t>

    </section>

  </section> 

  <section title="Anonymization Export Support in IPFIX" anchor="aes-section">

    <t>Anonymized data exported via IPFIX SHOULD be annotated with
    anonymization metadata, which details which fields described by which
    Templates are anonymized, and provides appropriate information on the
    anonymization techniques used. This metadata SHOULD be exported in Data
    Records described by the recommended Options Templates described in this
    section; these Options Templates use the additional Information Elements
    described in the following subsection.</t>

    <t>Note that fields anonymized using the black-marker (removal) technique
    do not require any special metadata support: black-marker anonymized
    fields SHOULD NOT be exported at all, by omitting the corresponding
    Information Elements from Template describing the Data Set.&nbsp; In the case
    where application requirements dictate that a black-marker anonymized
    field must remain in a Template, then an Exporting Process MAY export
    black-marker anonymized fields with their native length as all-zeros, but
    only in cases where enough contextual information exists within the record
    to differentiate a black-marker anonymized field exported in this way from
    a real zero value.</t>

    <section title="Anonymization Records and the Anonymization Options Template" anchor="opt-section">

      <t>The Anonymization Options Template describes Anonymization Records,
      which allow anonymization metadata to be exported inline over IPFIX or
      stored in an IPFIX File, by binding information about anonymization
      techniques to Information Elements within defined Templates or Options
      Templates. IPFIX Exporting Processes SHOULD export anonymization records
      for any Template describing exported anonymized Data Records; IPFIX
      Collecting Processes and processes downstream from them MAY use
      anonymization records to treat anonymized data differently depending on
      the applied technique.</t>

      <t>Anonymization Records contain ancillary information bound to a
      Template, so many of the considerations for Templates apply to
      Anonymization Records as well. First, reliability is important: an
      Exporting Process SHOULD export Anonymization Records after the
      Templates they describe have been exported, and SHOULD export
      anonymization records reliably if supported by the underlying transport
      (i.e., without partial reliability when using Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)).</t>

      <t>Anonymization Records MUST be handled by Collecting Processes as
      scoped to the Template to which they apply within the Transport Session
      in which they are sent. When a Template is withdrawn via a Template
      Withdrawal Message or expires during a UDP transport session, the
      accompanying Anonymization Records are withdrawn or expire as well and
      do not apply to subsequent Templates with the same Template ID within
      the Session unless re-exported.</t>
      
      <t>The Stability Class within the anonymizationFlags IE can be used to
      declare that a given anonymization technique's mapping will remain
      stable across multiple sessions, but this does not mean that
      anonymization technique information given in the Anonymization Records
      themselves persist across Sessions. Each new Transport Session MUST
      contain new Anonymization Records for each Template describing
      anonymized Data Sets.</t>

      <t>SCTP per-stream export <xref
      target="IPFIX-PERSTREAM"/> may be used to ease
      management of Anonymization Records if appropriate for the

  <section title="Applying Anonymization Techniques to IPFIX Export and Storage" anchor="export-anon-section">

    <t>When exporting or storing anonymized flow data using IPFIX, certain
    interactions between the IPFIX protocol and the anonymization techniques
    in use must be considered; these are treated in the subsections below.</t>

    <section title="Arrangement of Processes in IPFIX Anonymization" anchor="export-anon-arrangement">

      <t>Anonymization may be applied to IPFIX data at three stages within the
      collection infrastructure: on initial export, at a mediator, or after
      collection, as shown in <xref target="loc-fig"></xref>. Each of these
      locations has specific considerations and applicability.</t>

      <t>Anonymization is generally performed before the wider dissemination
      or repurposing of a dataset, e.g., adapting operational
      measurement data for research. Therefore, direct anonymization of flow
      data on initial export is only applicable in certain restricted
      circumstances: when the Exporting Process (EP) is "publishing" data to a
      Collecting Process (CP) directly, and the Exporting Process and
      Collecting Process are operated by different entities. Note that certain
      guidelines in <xref target="header-anon"></xref> with respect to
      timestamp anonymization may not apply in this case, as the Collecting
      Process may be able to deduce certain timing information from the time
      at which each Message is received.</t>

      <t>A much more flexible arrangement is to anonymize data within a <xref
      target="RFC6183">Mediator</xref>. Here,
      original data is sent to a Mediator, which performs the anonymization
      function and re-exports the anonymized data. Such a Mediator could be
      located at the administrative domain boundary of the initial Exporting
      Process operator, exporting anonymized data to other consumers outside
      the organization. In this case, the original Exporter SHOULD use <xref
      target="RFC5246">TLS</xref> as specified in <xref
      target="RFC5101"></xref> to secure the channel to the Mediator, and the
      Mediator should follow the guidelines in <xref
      target="guidelines"></xref>, to mitigate the risk of original data
      disclosure.</t>

      <t>When data is to be published as an anonymized dataset in an <xref
      target="RFC5655">IPFIX File</xref>, the anonymization may be done at the
      final Collecting Process before storage and dissemination, as well. In
      this case, the Collector should follow the guidelines in <xref
      target="guidelines"></xref>, especially as regards File-specific Options
      in <xref target="opt-anon"></xref> </t>

      <t>In each of these data flows, the anonymization of records is
      undertaken by an Intermediate Anonymization Process (IAP); the data
      flows into and out of this IAP are shown in <xref target="iap-dataflows"></xref> below.</t>

      <t>Anonymization parameters must also be available to the Exporting

      <t>Following each of the data flows through the IAP, we describe
      five basic types of anonymization arrangements within this framework in

      7.3.7 of <xref target="RFC5655"></xref>).</t>

      <t>Note that anonymization may occur at more than one location within a  
      given collection infrastructure, to provide varying levels of anonymization, 
      disclosure risk, or data utility for specific purposes.</t>

    </section>
    
    <section title="IPFIX-Specific Anonymization Guidelines" anchor="guidelines">

      <t>In implementing and deploying the anonymization techniques described
      in this document, implementors should note that IPFIX already provides
      features that support anonymized data export, and use these where
      appropriate. Care must also be taken that data structures supporting the
      operation of the protocol itself do not leak data that could be used to
      reverse the anonymization applied to the flow data. Such data structures
      may appear in the header, or within the data stream itself, especially
      as options data. Each of these and their impact on specific
      anonymization techniques is noted in a separate subsection below.</t>

      <section title="Appropriate Use of Information Elements for Anonymized Data" anchor="iespec-anon">

        <t>Note, as in <xref target="aes-section"></xref> above, that
        black-marker anonymized fields SHOULD NOT be exported at all; the
        absence of the field in a given Data Set is implicitly declared by not
        including the corresponding Information Element in the Template
        describing that Data Set.</t>

        <t>When using precision degradation of timestamps, Exporting Processes
        SHOULD export timing information using Information Elements of an
        appropriate precision, as explained in Section 4.5 of <xref
        target="RFC5153"></xref>. For example, timestamps measured in
        millisecond-level precision and degraded to second-level precision
        should use flowStartSeconds and flowEndSeconds, not
        flowStartMilliseconds and flowEndMilliseconds.</t>

        <t>When exporting anonymized data and anonymization metadata,
        Exporting Processes SHOULD ensure that the combination of Information
        Element and declared anonymization technique are compatible.
        Specifically, the applicable and recommended Information Element types
        and semantics for each technique are noted in the description of the
        anonymizationTechnique Information Element in <xref
        target="ie-at-section"></xref>. In this description, a timestamp is an
        Information Element with the data type dateTimeSeconds,
        dataTimeMilliseconds, dateTimeMicroseconds, or dateTimeNanoseconds; an
        address is an Information Element with the data type ipv4Address,
        ipv6Address, or macAddress; and an identifier is an Information
        Element with identifier data type semantics. Exporting Process MUST
        NOT export Anonymization Options records binding techniques to
        Information Elements to which they are not applicable, and SHOULD NOT
        export Anonymization Options records binding techniques to Information
        Elements for which they are not recommended. </t>

      </section>
      
      <section title="Export of Perimeter-Based Anonymization Policies" anchor="perimeter-anon">

          <t>Data collected from a single network may require different
          anonymization policies for addresses internal and external to the
          network. For example, internal addresses could be subject to simple
          permutation, while external addresses could be aggregated into
          networks by truncation. When exporting anonymized perimeter
          bidirectional flow (biflow) data as in Section 5.2 of <xref
          target="RFC5103"/>, this arrangement may be easily represented by
          specifying one technique for source endpoint information (which
          represents the external endpoint in a perimeter biflow) and one
          technique for destination endpoint information (which represents the
          internal address in a perimeter biflow).</t>

          <t>However, it can also be useful to represent perimeter-based
          anonymization policies with unidirectional flow (uniflow), or
          non-perimeter biflow data. In this case, the Perimeter Anonymization
          bit (bit 2) in the anonymizationFlags Information Element describing
          the anonymized address Information Elements can be set to change the
          meaning of "source" and "destination" of Information Elements to
          mean "external" and "internal" as with perimeter biflows, but only
          with respect to anonymization policies.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Anonymization of Header Data" anchor="header-anon">

        <t>Each IPFIX Message contains a Message Header; within this Message
        Header are contained two fields which may be used to break certain
        anonymization techniques: the Export Time, and the Observation Domain
        ID.</t>

        <t>Export of IPFIX Messages containing anonymized timestamp data where
        the original Export Time Message header has some relationship to the
        anonymized timestamps SHOULD anonymize the Export Time header field so
        that the Export Time is consistent with the anonymized timestamp data.
        Otherwise, relationships between export and flow time could be used to
        partially or totally reverse timestamp anonymization. When anonymizing
        timestamps and the Export Time header field SHOULD avoid times too far
        in the past or future; while <xref target="RFC5101"/> does not make
        any allowance for Export Time error detection, it is sensible that
        Collecting Processes may interpret Messages with seemingly nonsensical
        Export Times as erroneous. Specific limits are
        implementation dependent, but this issue may cause interoperability
        issues when anonymizing the Export Time header field.</t>

        <t>The similarity in size between an Observation Domain ID and an IPv4
        address (32 bits) may lead to a temptation to use an IPv4 interface
        address on the Metering or Exporting Process as the Observation Domain
        ID. If this address bears some relation to the IP addresses in the
        flow data (e.g., shares a network prefix with internal addresses) and
        the IP addresses in the flow data are anonymized in a
        structure-preserving way, then the Observation Domain ID may be used
        to break the IP address anonymization. Use of an IPv4 interface
        address on the Metering or Exporting Process as the Observation Domain
        ID is NOT RECOMMENDED in this case.</t>

      <section title="Anonymization of Options Data" anchor="opt-anon">

        <t>IPFIX uses the Options mechanism to export, among other things,
        metadata about exported flows and the flow collection infrastructure.
        As with the IPFIX Message Header, certain Options recommended in <xref
        target="RFC5101"></xref> and <xref target="RFC5655"></xref> containing
        flow timestamps and network addresses of Exporting and Collecting
        Processes may be used to break certain anonymization techniques. When
        using these Options along anonymized data export and storage, values
        within the Options that could be used to break the anonymization
        SHOULD themselves be anonymized or omitted.</t>

        <t>The Exporting Process Reliability Statistics Options Template,
        recommended in <xref target="RFC5101"></xref>, contains an Exporting
        Process ID field, which may be an exportingProcessIPv4Address
        Information Element or an exportingProcessIPv6Address Information
        Element. If the Exporting Process address bears some relation to the
        IP addresses in the flow data (e.g., shares a network prefix with
        internal addresses) and the IP addresses in the flow data are
        anonymized in a structure-preserving way, then the Exporting Process
        address may be used to break the IP address anonymization. Exporting
        Processes exporting anonymized data in this situation SHOULD mitigate
        the risk of attack either by omitting Options described by the
        Exporting Process Reliability Statistics Options Template or by
        anonymizing the Exporting Process address using a similar technique to
        that used to anonymize the IP addresses in the exported data.</t>

        <t>Similarly, the Export Session Details Options Template and Message
        Details Options Template specified for the <xref
        target="RFC5655">IPFIX File Format</xref> may contain the
        exportingProcessIPv4Address Information Element or the
        exportingProcessIPv6Address Information Element to identify an
        Exporting Process from which a flow record was received, and the
        collectingProcessIPv4Address Information Element or the
        collectingProcessIPv6Address Information Element to identify the
        Collecting Process which received it. If the Exporting Process or
        Collecting Process address bears some relation to the IP addresses in
        the dataset (e.g., shares a network prefix with internal addresses)
        and the IP addresses in the dataset are anonymized in a
        structure-preserving way, then the Exporting Process or Collecting
        Process address may be used to break the IP address anonymization.
        Since these Options Templates are primarily intended for storing IPFIX
        Transport Session data for auditing, replay, and testing purposes, it
        is NOT RECOMMENDED that storage of anonymized data include these
        Options Templates in order to mitigate the risk of attack.</t>

        <t>The Message Details Options Template specified for the <xref
        target="RFC5655">IPFIX File Format</xref> also contains the
        collectionTimeMilliseconds Information Element. As with the Export
        Time Message Header field, if the exported dataset contains
        anonymized timestamp information, and the collectionTimeMilliseconds
        Information Element in a given Message has some relationship to the
        anonymized timestamp information, then this relationship can be
        exploited to reverse the timestamp anonymization. Since this Options
        Template is primarily intended for storing IPFIX Transport Session
        data for auditing, replay, and testing purposes, it is NOT RECOMMENDED
        that storage of anonymized data include this Options Template in order
        to mitigate the risk of attack.</t>

        <t>Since the Time Window Options Template specified for the <xref
        target="RFC5655">IPFIX File Format</xref> refers to the timestamps
        within the dataset to provide partial table of contents information
        for an IPFIX File, Options described by this Template SHOULD be
        written using the anonymized timestamps instead of the original
        ones.</t>

      <section title="Special-Use Address Space Considerations" anchor="sua-anon">

          <t>When anonymizing data for transport or storage using IPFIX
          containing anonymized IP addresses, and the analysis purpose permits
          doing so, it is RECOMMENDED to filter out or leave unanonymized data
          containing the special-use IPv4 addresses enumerated in <xref
          target="RFC5735"/> or the special-use IPv6 addresses enumerated in
          <xref target="RFC5156"/>. Data containing these addresses (e.g.
          0.0.0.0 and 169.254.0.0/16 for link-local autoconfiguration in IPv4
          space) are often associated with specific, well-known behavioral
          patterns. Detection of these patterns in anonymized data can lead to
          deanonymization of these special-use addresses, which increases the
          chance of a complete reversal of anonymization by an attacker,
          especially of prefix-preserving techniques.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Protecting Out-of-Band Configuration and Management Data">

       <t>Special care should be taken when exporting or sharing anonymized
       data to avoid information leakage via the configuration or management
       planes of the IPFIX Device containing the Exporting Process or the File
       Writer. For example, adding noise to counters is useless if the
       receiver can deduce the values in the counters from Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) information,
       and concealing the network under test is similarly useless if such
       information is available in a configuration document. As the specifics
       of these concerns are largely implementation and deployment dependent,
       specific mitigation is out of scope for this document. The general ground
       rule is that information of similar type to that anonymized SHOULD NOT
       be made available to the receiver by any means, whether in the Data
       Records, in IPFIX protocol structures such as Message Headers, or
       out of band.</t>

  <section title="Security Considerations">


    <t>This document provides guidelines for exporting metadata about
    anonymized data in IPFIX, or storing metadata about anonymized data in
    IPFIX Files. It is not intended as a general statement on the
    applicability of specific flow data anonymization techniques. Exporters or
    publishers of anonymized data must take care that the applied
    anonymization technique is appropriate for the data source, the purpose,
    and the risk of deanonymization of a given application. Research in
    anonymization techniques, and techniques for deanonymization, is ongoing,
    and currently "safe" anonymization techniques may be rendered unsafe by
    future developments. </t>

    <t>We note specifically that anonymization is not a replacement for
    encryption for confidentiality. It is only appropriate for protecting
    identifying information in data to be used for purposes in which the
    protected data is irrelevant. Confidentiality in export is best served by
    using <xref target="RFC5246">TLS</xref> or <xref
    target="RFC4347">Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)</xref> as in the Security Considerations section of
    <xref target="RFC5101"/>, and in long-term storage by
    implementation-specific protection applied as in the Security
    Considerations section of <xref target="RFC5655"/>. Indeed,
    confidentiality and anonymization are not mutually exclusive, as
    encryption for confidentiality may be applied to anonymized data export or
    storage, as well, when the anonymized data is not intended for public
    release.</t>

    <t>We note as well that care should be taken even with well-anonymized
    data, and anonymized data should still be treated as privacy sensitive.
    Anonymization reduces the risk of misuse, but is not a complete solution
    to the problem of protecting end-user privacy in network flow trace
    analysis.</t>

    <t>When using pseudonymization techniques that have a mutable mapping,
    there is an inherent trade-off in the stability of the map between
    long-term comparability and security of the dataset against
    deanonymization. In general, deanonymization attacks are more effective
    given more information, so the longer a given mapping is valid, the more
    information can be applied to deanonymization. The specific details of
    this are technique-dependent and therefore out of the scope of this
    document.</t>

    <t>When releasing anonymized data, publishers need to ensure that data
    that could be used in deanonymization is not leaked through a side
    channel. The entire workflow (hardware, software, operational policies and
    procedures, etc.) for handling anonymized data must be evaluated for risk
    of data leakage. While most of these possible side channels are out of
    scope for this document, guidelines for reducing the risk of information
    leakage specific to the IPFIX export protocol are provided in <xref
    target="guidelines"/>.</t>

    <t>Note as well that the Security Considerations section of <xref
    target="RFC5101"/> applies as well to the export of anonymized data, and
    the Security Considerations section of <xref
    target="RFC5655"/> to the storage of anonymized data, or the
    publication of anonymized traces.</t>

<abstract><t>This document specifies an extension to the specifications in RFC5101, IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX), when using the Partial Reliability extension of SCTP (PR-SCTP, Partial Reliability Stream Control Transmission Protocol). When implemented at both the Exporting and Collecting Processes, this method offers several advantages such as the ability to calculate Data Record losses for PR-SCTP, immediate export of Template Withdrawal Messages, immediate reuse of Template IDs within an SCTP stream, reduced likelihood of Data Record loss, and reduced demands on the Collecting Process. When implemented in only the Collecting or Exporting Process then normal IPFIX behavior will be seen without these additional benefits.</t></abstract>
