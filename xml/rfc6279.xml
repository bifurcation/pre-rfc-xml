      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 is the IETF Standard for network-based mobility
management. In Proxy Mobile IPv6, mobile nodes are topologically anchored at a
Local Mobility Anchor, which forwards all data for registered mobile nodes. The
setup and maintenance of localized routing, which allows forwarding of data
packets between two mobile nodes' Mobility Access Gateways without involvement
of their Local Mobility Anchor in forwarding, is not considered. This document
describes the problem space of localized routing in Proxy Mobile IPv6.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The IETF has specified Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6)
      <xref target="RFC5213"></xref> as the base protocol for network-based
      localized mobility management (NetLMM).
      The scope of the base protocol covers the setup and
      maintenance of a tunnel between a Mobile Node's (MN's) Mobile
      Access Gateway (MAG) and its selected Local
      Mobility Anchor (LMA). Data packets will always traverse the MN's MAG
      and its LMA, irrespective of the location of the MN's remote
      communication endpoint. Even though an MN may be attached to the same
      MAG or a different MAG as its Correspondent Node (CN) within the same
      provider
      domain, packets being associated with their communication will traverse
      the MN's and the CN's LMA, which can be located topologically far away from
      the MN's and the CN's MAG or even in a separate provider domain.
      <xref target="RFC5213"></xref> addresses the
      need to enable local routing of traffic between two nodes being attached
      to the same MAG, but does not specify the complete procedure to establish
      such localized routing state on the shared MAG.</t>

      <t>The NetLMM Extensions (NetExt) Working Group has an objective to design
      a solution for localized routing in PMIPv6. This objective includes the specification
      of protocol messages and associated protocol operation between PMIPv6
      components to support the setup of a direct routing path for data packets
      between the MN's and the CN's MAG, while both hosts receive mobility service according
      to the PMIPv6 protocol <xref target="RFC5213"></xref>. As a result of localized
      routing, these packets will be forwarded between the two associated MAGs without
      traversing the MN's and the CN's LMA(s). In cases where one or both nodes hand over to
      a different MAG, the localized routing protocol maintains the localized
      routing path. Relevant protocol interfaces may include the interface
      between associated MAGs, between a MAG and an LMA, and between LMAs.

<!-- New May 2011? -->
      The setup
      of localized routing with CNs not registered with a PMIPv6 network is out
      of scope of the NetExt solution and this problem statement.

      <t>This document analyzes and discusses the problem space of always using
      the default route through two communicating mobile nodes'
      local mobility anchors. Furthermore, the problem space of enabling localized
      routing in PMIPv6 is analyzed and described, while different
      communication and mobility scenarios are taken into account.

    <section title="Problem Statement for Localized Routing in PMIPv6">

<section title="General Observation">

      <t>The Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) protocol <xref target="RFC3775"></xref> has
      built-in mechanisms for direct communication between an MN and a CN.
      Mechanisms for route optimization in MIPv6 cannot be directly applied in
      PMIPv6. Following the paradigm of PMIPv6, MNs are not involved in
      mobility signaling and hence cannot perform signaling to set up localized
      routes. Instead, the solution for localized routing must consider functions
      in the network to find out whether or not a localized route is to be
      used and then control the setup and maintenance of localized routing
      states accordingly without any assistance from the MN and the CN.

      In the case of communication between two nodes attached to the PMIPv6
      network infrastructure and where each node is registered with an LMA, data
      packets between these two nodes will always traverse the responsible
      LMA(s). At least some deployments would benefit from having such
      communication localized, rather than having packets traverse the core network to the
      LMA(s). In the context of this document, such localized communication
      comprises offloading traffic from LMAs and establishing an optimized
      forwarding path between the two communication endpoints.</t>

      <t>Localized routing is understood in <xref target="RFC5213"></xref> as
      optimization of traffic between an MN and a CN that are attached to an
      access link connected to the same MAG. In such a case, the MAG forwards traffic
      directly between the MN and the CN, assuming the MAG is enabled to
      support this feature (setting of the EnableMAGLocalRouting flag on the
      MAG) and the MN's LMA enforces this optimization. <xref target="RFC5213"></xref>
      does not specify how an LMA can enforce optimization for such local communication.
      Maintaining local forwarding between the MN and the regular IPv6 CN gets more
      complex in the case where the MN performs a handover to a different
MAG. Such a use case is
      not considered in the specification and is out of scope of this problem statement.
      This document focuses on use cases where both nodes, the MN and the CN, are
      within a PMIPv6 network and served by an LMA in a domain of LMAs.</t>

      <t><!-- May11: Localized routing is relevant at least for the following two reasons:-->
      With localized routing, operators have the possibility of offloading
      traffic from LMAs
      and from the core network. Establishment of a direct path between the MN's and the
      CN's MAG can be beneficial for the following reasons:
      First, by limiting the communication to the access nodes, the data
      traffic traversing the MAG - LMA path (network) can be reduced. This is
      significant, considering that the transport network between the access
      and the core is often the bottleneck in terms of costs and performance.
      Second, there may be performance benefits for data flows between the
      MN and the CN in terms of delay and packet loss, especially when the
      MN and the CN are attached to the same MAG and the LMA is topologically
      far away from that MAG. Even when the MN and the CN are attached to
      different MAGs, there could be benefit in limiting the communication
      to the access network only, rather than traversing the transport network
      to the LMA. Furthermore, offloading traffic from the LMA by means of
      localized routing can improve scalability of the LMA, as it represents a
      bottleneck for traffic being forwarded by many MAGs.
      <!-- removed May11: Hence, providing the necessary protocol specification to
      enable localized routing in PMIPv6 is strongly recommended.--></t>

<section title="Use Cases Analysis">

     <t>This problem statement focuses on local communication between PMIPv6
     managed nodes, which attach to MAGs sharing the same provider domain.
     The following list analyzes different use cases, which consider
     the existence of multiple LMAs. <xref target="architecture"></xref> depicts
     a PMIPv6-based network with two mobility anchors.
     According to <xref target="RFC5213"></xref>, the MN moves in the PMIPv6 domain being
     built by its LMA and MAG. The same applies to the CN, which moves in the PMIPv6
     domain built by the CN's LMA and MAG. The analysis takes no assumption on
     whether the MN and the CN share the same PMIPv6 domain or not.</t>

      <t>All "A" use cases below assume that both the MN and the CN are registered
      with an LMA according to the PMIPv6 protocol. Whereas MAG1 is always
      considered as the MN's current Proxy Care-of Address, the CN can be either
      connected to the same MAG or to a different MAG or LMA as the MN. Accordingly, these
      topological differences are denoted as follows:</t>

      <t>A[number of MAGs][number of LMAs]</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="A11:">The MN and the CN (CN1) connect to the same MAG (MAG1)
          and are registered with the same LMA (LMA). The common MAG may
          forward data packets between the MN and the CN directly without
          forwarding any packet to the LMA. <xref target="RFC5213"></xref>
          addresses this use case, but does not specify the complete
          procedure to establish such localized routing state on the shared
          MAG.</t>

          <t hangText="A12:">The MN and the CN (CN1) connect to the same MAG (MAG1)

          The common MAG may forward data packets between the
          MN and the CN directly without forwarding any packet to the LMAs.
          Following the policy of <xref target="RFC5213"></xref> and
          enforcement of the setup of a localized forwarding path, potential
          problems exist in the case where LMA1 and LMA2 differ in their policy to
          control the MAG.</t>

          <t hangText="A21:">The CN (CN2) connects to a different MAG (MAG2)
          than the MN (MAG1), but the MN and the CN are registered with the same LMA

          routing information at MAG1 and MAG2, which allows direct forwarding
          of packets between the MN's MAG1 and the CN's MAG2. As LMA1 is the
          common anchor for the MN and the CN and maintains location information for
          both nodes, no major race condition and instability in updating the
          states for localized routing is expected.</t>

          <t hangText="A22:">The CN (CN2) connects to a different MAG (MAG2)

          information of the CN and the MN is maintained at different LMAs,
          both LMAs need to be involved in the procedure to set up localized
          routing. In the case of a handover of the MN and/or the CN to a
          different MAG, non-synchronized control of updating the states
          for localized routing may result in race conditions, superfluous
          signaling, and packet loss.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The following list summarizes general problems with setting up and
      maintaining localized routing between an MN and a CN.
      In the context of this problem statement, the MN and the CN are
      always assumed to be registered at an LMA according to the PMIPv6
      protocol <xref target="RFC5213"></xref>.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>MNs do not participate in mobility management and hence cannot
          perform binding registration at a CN on their own. Rather, entities
          in the network infrastructure must take over the role of MNs to set
          up and maintain a direct route. Accordingly, a solution for
          localized routing in PMIPv6 must specify protocol operation between
          relevant network components, such as between a MAG and an LMA, to
          enable localized routing for data traffic without traversing the
          MN's and the CN's LMA(s).</t>

          <t>In the case where the MN and the CN are both registered with different LMAs
          according to the PMIPv6 protocol, relevant information for the
          setup of a localized routing path, such as the current MAG of the MN
          and the CN, is distributed between these LMAs. This may complicate
          the setup and stable maintenance of states enabling localized
          routing.</t>

          <t>In the case where localized routing between an MN and a CN has been
          successfully set up and both nodes move and attach to a new access
          router simultaneously, signaling the new location and maintenance
          of states for localized routing at relevant routers may run into a
          race condition situation.  This can happen in the case where coordination of
          signaling for localized routing and provisioning of relevant state
          information is distributed between different network entities,
          e.g., different LMAs.  In such a case, as a result of the MN's handover,
          updated information about the MN's location may arrive at the CN's
          previous MAG, while the CN has already moved to a new MAG. The same
          applies to the other direction, where the system may update the MN's
          previous MAG about the CN's new location, while the MN has moved to a
          new MAG in the meantime. The protocol solution must deal with          
          such exceptional handover cases efficiently to avoid or resolve such
          problems.</t>

<section anchor="IPv4issues" title="IPv4 Considerations">

     <t>According to <xref target="RFC5844"></xref>,
     the basic configuration requirements for supporting IPv4 in PMIPv6 are that
     LMAs and MAGs are both IPv4 and IPv6 enabled. Also, LMAs and MAGs must have
     a globally unique IPv6 address configured, irrespective of enabled
     support for IPv6 routing between these components. This requirement
     should also apply to configuration requirements of localized routing.</t>

     <t>Additional issues emerge when localized routing is considered
     for PMIPv6 with IPv4 support. These can be classified into two
     general groups: issues with localized routing between
     an MN's and a CN's IPv4 Home Addresses, and transport plane issues.
     The following subsections analyze these two groups. </t>


<section title="Localized Routing for Communication between IPv4 Home Addresses">

        <t>In the case where an LMA and a MAG hold a registration to support IPv4 Home
        Address mobility for an MN, the MAG and the LMA must support
        appropriate encapsulation of IPv4 packets. To enable localized
        routing, the MN's MAG must encapsulate and forward routing path
        optimized packets to the CN's MAG and needs to ensure that the chosen
        encapsulation mode is supported by the correspondent MAG.
        Incompatibility in a selected encapsulation mode causes failure in
        setting up a localized route.</t>

        <t>When localized routing is used for IPv4 traffic, the conceptual
        data structures on associated MAGs must be augmented with appropriate
        parameters for forwarding localized traffic. MAGs may need to maintain a
        routing state for each MN-CN-pair and make routing decisions for
        uplink traffic based on the packet's complete IPv4 source and
        destination address.
 Hence, conceptual data structures to handle
        states for localized routes need to comprise this address
        tuple for unique identification.</t>

        <t>As a known constraint, IPv4 addresses of two nodes that hold addresses
        from a private address space may overlap. To uniquely identify both nodes, the
        IPv4 address of the MN and the CN must not overlap. To cope with overlapping address
        spaces, the localized routing solution could use additional mechanisms to
        tag and uniquely identify the MN and the CN.
        </t>
</section>


<section title="IPv4 Transport Network Considerations">

   <t>The transport network between the LMA and the MAG may be based on IPv6 or IPv4.
   Deployments may ensure that the same transport mechanism (i.e., IPv6
   or IPv4) is used for operational consistency. Similar to the encapsulation
   requirement stated in the previous section, the IP version used for
   localized routing is also assumed, by configuration, to be consistent
   across all MAGs within the associated provider domain. The design of
   optional mechanisms for negotiating the IP version to use as well as
   the encapsulation mode to use are outside the scope of the NetExt WG's
   solution for localized routing.</t>

<section title="Functional Requirements for Localized Routing">

     <t>Several tasks need to be performed by the network infrastructure
      components before relevant information for such direct communication is
      discovered and associated states for localized routing can be set up.
      The following list summarizes some key functions that need to be
      performed by the PMIPv6-enabled network infrastructure to substitute
      mobile nodes in setting up a direct route.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Detection of the possibility to perform localized routing. This
          function includes looking at a data packet's source and destination
          address.</t>

          <t>Initiation of a procedure that sets up a localized routing path.</t>

          <t>Discovery of stateful entities (i.e., the LMA(s) and/or the
          MAG(s)) that maintain and can provide relevant information needed
          to set up a localized routing path. Such information may include the
          routable address of an LMA or MAG, where one or both mobile nodes
          are connected to and registered with that LMA or MAG.</t>

          <t>Control in setting up and maintaining (e.g., during handover) the
          localized routing path. Control is also needed to terminate the use
          of a localized routing path and to delete associated states, whereas
          a trigger for the termination may come from a non-PMIPv6-related
          component.</t>

          <t> Enforcement of administrative policy rules to localized routing.
          Such policies allow operators to have further control of the setup of a
          localized route and enable the possibility to disallow localized routing,
          for example, to ensure that traffic traverses charging-related functions on the LMA.
          Explicit authorization of localized routing is, for example, discussed in
          <xref target="PMIP6-LR"></xref>. As a further example,
          mobile-node- and operator-specific policy rules can be established on
          PMIPv6 components during PMIPv6 bootstrapping according
          to <xref target="RFC5779"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="secroaming" title="Roaming Considerations">


<t><xref target="roaming"></xref> shows PMIPv6 roaming cases where PMIPv6 components
(e.g., LMAs, MAGs) tied by the MN and the CN may be distributed between different provider domains
(i.e., domain A, B, C) and the MN and/or CN moves from one provider domain to another one.
In order to support localized routing when roaming occurs, it is required that
MAGs to which the MN and CN connect be within the same provider domain, and
each MAG
has a security relationship with the corresponding LMA, which maintains the
registration 
of the MN or the CN, respectively.</t>

<t>According to the roaming model as depicted in <xref target="roaming"></xref>,
the MN's PMIPv6 domain is characterized by its MAG (MAG1/MAG1') and its LMA (LMA1),
whereas the CN's PMIPv6 domain is characterized by the CN's MAG (MAG2/MAG2') and its LMA (LMA2/LMA2').
A solution for localized routing cannot take any assumption about whether or
not the MN and
CN share the same PMIPv6 domain; hence, MAG1/MAG1' may not share a security association
with LMA2/LMA2', and MAG2/MAG2' may not share a security association with LMA1, respectively.</t>

<t>It is not required that LMAs, which hold the registration for the MN and the CN,
respectively, be part of the same provider domain as the MAGs where the MN and CN attach. When
the MN's MAG and LMA belong to different provider domains (A and C), localized routing
is subject to policy governing the service level agreements between these domains. The same
applies to the provider domains that provide the CN's MAG and LMA. Based on the above
requirements, four PMIPv6 roaming and non-roaming cases can be taken into account.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Case 1: The MN's MAG (MAG1), the CN's MAG (MAG2), the MN's LMA (LMA1),
          and the CN's LMA (LMA2) are located in the same provider domain A.</t>
          <t>Case 2: The MN's MAG (MAG1), the CN's MAG (MAG2), and the MN's LMA (LMA1)
          are located in the same domain A, while the CN's LMA (LMA2') is located
          in provider domain B.</t>
          <t>Case 3: The MN's MAG (MAG1') and the CN's MAG (MAG2') are located in
          domain C, while the MN's LMA (LMA1) and the CN's LMA (LMA2) are located
          in provider domain A.</t>
          <t>Case 4: The MN's MAG (MAG1') and the CN's MAG (MAG2') are located in provider
          domain C, while the MN's LMA (LMA1) is located in provider domain A and
          the CN's LMA (LMA2') is located in provider domain B.</t>
       </list></t>

<t>
In these roaming cases, the MN can be allowed to roam within its domain (e.g.,
the MN's home
domain in which the MN's LMA is located) or over different domains (e.g., the MN moves from
its home domain to a visited domain). During mobility, the CN and MN should remain
attached to MAGs of the same provider domain to maintain efficient routing of traffic
between their MAGs.

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>A protocol solution for localized routing in a PMIPv6 network
      must counter unauthorized change of a routing path. In particular,
      the control plane for localized routing must preclude the blocking or
      hijacking of mobile nodes' traffic by malicious or compromised
      network components. A security solution must support suitable
      mechanisms for authentication of control plane components of the
      localized routing functional architecture for both roaming and
      non-roaming scenarios. Any possibility for Internet hosts to interfere with
      the localized routing procedure in a malicious manner must be precluded.
      </t>

      <t>Since network entities other than MNs and CNs perform signaling to
      set up localized routing, the MIPv6 return routability test <xref
      target="RFC3775"></xref> is not suitable to authenticate associated
      signaling messages in PMIPv6.
      Solutions for localized routing in PMIPv6 need to mitigate, or to provide
      sufficient defense against, possible security threats. When PMIPv6
      participants are administered within the same domain,
      infrastructure-based authorization mechanisms, such as IPsec, may be
      usable to protect signaling for localized routing.</t>

      <t>Existing security associations according to <xref
      target="RFC5213"></xref> can be re-used to protect signaling for
      localized routing on the interface between a MAG and an LMA. In the case
      where a
      protocol solution for localized routing in PMIPv6 relies on protocol
      operation between MAGs, means for protection of signaling between these
      MAGs must be provided. The same applies for signaling on a possible
      protocol interface between two LMAs of the same domain.</t>
