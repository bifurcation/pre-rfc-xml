    <abstract>
      <t>The Packet-switched Streaming Service (PSS) and the Multimedia
      Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) defined by 3GPP use the Session
Description Protocol (SDP) and Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) with
      some extensions. This document provides information about these
      extensions and registers the RTSP and SDP extensions with IANA.</t>
    </abstract>

  <middle>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>3GPP has specified the Packet-switched Streaming Service (PSS) that
      uses both <xref target="RFC2326">RTSP</xref> and <xref
      target="RFC4566">SDP</xref>. The service is specified in technical
      specifications <xref target="PSS-233">TS 26.233</xref> and <xref
      target="PSS-234">TS 26.234</xref> in Release 4 and subsequent releases.
      The basic service defined in Release 4 is enhanced in Release 5 with
      capability exchange, and in Release 6 with a number of features, such as
      adaptation, digital rights management (DRM), progressive download, as well as a
      streaming server file format defined in <xref target="PSS-3GP"></xref>.
      Fast start-up and content switching are addressed in Release 7.</t>

      <t>3GPP has also specified the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service
      (MBMS) that uses SDP. The IP-layer protocols used by this service are
      specified in technical specification TS 26.346 Release 6 <xref
      target="MBMS"></xref>. Release 7 extends the MBMS User Service to also
      work with unicast bearers for interactive and streaming traffic
      classes.</t>

      <t>In the process of defining these services, there has occasionally
      been a need to extend both SDP and RTSP functionalities. These
      extensions have mostly been in the form of SDP attributes and RTSP
      headers and option tags. 3GPP uses the name "feature tags" (like RTSP 2.0
      for what RTSP 1.0 calls "option tags"); "option tag" is the name that will
      be used in this document. The purpose of this informational document is
      to register these SDP and RTSP extensions, in order to avoid future
      conflicts, and also to raise the awareness of their existence within
      IETF.</t>

      <t>In <xref target="sec-sdp-proto"/>, this document defines three
      SDP protocol identifiers used in MBMS to enable the usage of block-based
      FEC. The SDP protocol identifiers require an RFC to be defined and
      registered. As this is an RFC from the IETF stream, any semantic 
      change will require a new IETF-approved RFC. 

<!-- [rfced]
 This text seems to mis-state the registration procedures. Does "IETF RFC"
mean "RFC from the IETF stream"?  If so, then the first sentence means an RFC
of any category, and the second sentence ("IETF approved") seems to mean an RFC
that had IETF consensus (which also does not limit the category).  It appears
that the text is referring to http://www.iana.org/assignments/sdp-parameters.

Introduction states:
  The SDP protocol identifiers require an IETF RFC to be defined and
  registered. Thus any semantic change will require a new IETF approved
  RFC.

Compare the IANA registry:
SDP Parameters 
(on http://www.iana.org/assignments/sdp-parameters)

Registration Procedures: RFC (Standards-Track preferred)

[Magnus] Yes, you are correct that it seems that only an RFC is 
required to register a SDP proto identifier. I have removed the "IETF" part 
of the sentence. This forces further change in the following sentence.  

-->

The other SDP and RTSP extensions registered by this document are
      not normatively defined in this document. Instead, the normative
      definitions are referenced by the registrations. 3GPP can update the
      normative definition in future versions of their specifications. However,
      to ensure that such a change is visible in the IETF, at minimum, IANA should
      be notified and the reference to the 3GPP specification updated, and
      preferably an updated version of this RFC published.</t>

      <t>The document begins with two sections presenting the SDP extensions
      for PSS and MBMS, respectively. They are followed by a section noting that
      offer/answer considerations are not applicable here. The subsequent
      section presents the extensions of RTSP for PSS. The IANA registration
      of SDP attributes and protocol identifiers is given in <xref
      target="sec-iana-sdp"></xref>, and the RTSP headers and option tags in
      <xref target="sec-iana-rtsp"></xref>. For normative descriptions of all
      SDP and RTSP extensions, we refer to <xref target="PSS-234">TS
      26.234</xref> and <xref target="MBMS">TS 26.346</xref>.</t>

    <section title="Applicability Statement">
      <t>This document describes 3GPP-defined extensions to <xref
      target="RFC4566">SDP</xref> and <xref target="RFC2326">RTSP</xref> and
      registers attributes that are normatively defined in 3GPP technical
      specifications 26.234, 26.244, and 26.346, up to the referenced versions
      of the respective documents.</t>

      <t>The SDP and RTSP extensions have only been defined for usage with the
      3GPP service in mind. The applicability for usage outside of these
      services has not been considered nor addressed. Usage of these
      attributes in other contexts may require further definitions or
      clarifications. For example, all SDP attributes lack offer/answer usage
      rules <xref target="RFC3264"></xref>, which currently makes it impossible
      to use them with offer/answer. Please note that change control of these
      SDP and RTSP extensions belongs to 3GPP.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="PSS SDP Extensions">
      <t>The PSS specification <xref target="PSS-234"></xref> defines a number
      of different SDP attributes for different purposes. They are listed
      below, grouped by their purpose. The text is intentionally not specific
      enough to allow implementation from this document. The normative
      definition is in the 3GPP technical specification cited.</t>

      <section title="Video Buffering Attributes" anchor="vba">
        <t>The following attributes are used to provide parameters for the
        video buffer model provided in Annex G and Section 5.3.3.2 of <xref
        target="PSS-234"></xref>. The attributes were defined in Release 5 as
        "X-" attributes and, at the time, were not considered for registration.
        In hindsight, however, they should not have been "X-" attributes, and
        they should have been registered, as the registration rules of SDP
        <xref target="RFC4566"></xref> point out. Changing their names today
        is impossible due to the deployed base of millions of mobile handsets
        supporting PSS, and therefore they are registered in their current
        form.</t>

        <t>All attributes are defined at media level.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The "a=X-predecbufsize" attribute provides the size of the
            pre-decoder buffer in bytes.</t>

            <t>The "a=X-initpredecbufperiod" attribute provides the time
            during which a receiver should initially buffer, in 90 kHz ticks,
            before starting to consume the data in the buffer in order to
            ensure that underflow does not occur, assuming correct data
            delivery.</t>

            <t>The "a=X-initpostdecbufperiod" attribute provides the initial
            buffering period, in 90 kHz ticks, for the post-decoder buffer
            present in H.263 and MPEG-4 Visual.</t>

            <t>The "a=X-decbyterate" attribute indicates the maximum peak
            byte-decoding rate used in the verification of the Annex G buffer
            model expressed in bytes per second.</t>

            <t>The "a=3gpp-videopostdecbufsize" attribute is used to indicate
            the value used in determining the H.264 video post-decoder buffer
            size.</t>
          </list>Note that complete descriptions of these attributes can be
        found in Section 5.3.3.2 of <xref target="PSS-234"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="Video Frame Size Attribute">
        <t>This media-level attribute provides the receiver with the largest
        picture size that a specific H.263 payload type will carry within the
        session. The attribute has the following form (see Section 5.3.3.2 of <xref
        target="PSS-234"></xref>):</t>

        <t>These attributes are all used to configure the integrity-protection
        mechanism defined in Annex K (Sections K.2.2.1, K.2.2.2, and K.2.2.3) of
        <xref target="PSS-234"></xref>.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The session-level attribute "a=3GPP-Integrity-Key" carries the
            integrity key used to derive SRTP master keys for integrity
            protection. The key is protected in different ways depending on a
            method identifier. When using Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) DRM key management, the key is
            encrypted using AES <xref target="AES"/> before it is base64 encoded <xref
            target="RFC4648"></xref>.</t>

            <t>The media-level attribute "a=3GPP-SRTP-Config" is used to
            configure SRTP for integrity protection and contains an integrity
            nonce, a key salt used in deriving the SRTP master key from the
            integrity key, and any SRTP configuration parameters, such as the
            integrity tag length.</t>

            <t>The session-level attribute "a=3GPP-SDP-Auth" is used to carry
            an authentication tag calculated over certain parts of the SDP to
            prevent manipulation of the security attributes.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="The Alternative Attributes">
        <t>Two media-level and one session-level attributes are used in 
        a mechanism for providing alternative SDP lines. One or more SDP 
        lines at media level can be replaced, if desired, by 
        alternatives. The mechanism is backwards compatible in the way 
        that a receiver that does not support the attributes will get 
        the default configuration. The different alternatives can be 
        grouped using different attributes that can be specified 
        hierarchically with a top and a lower level. 3GPP Release 6 
        supports grouping based on bit-rate, according to the SDP 
        bandwidth modifiers <xref target="RFC4566">AS</xref> and <xref 
        target="RFC3890">TIAS</xref>, and language.</t>

<!-- [rfced] Should AS and TIAS be expanded here?
If so, please provide their expansion.

[MAGNUS] They are really not acronyms, but protocol 
elements that can be read out. We can put in references. 
AS is defined in RFC 4566 and TIAS in RFC 3890.
-->

        <t>The SDP attributes (see Sections 5.3.3.3 and 5.3.3.4 of <xref

            <t>The media-level attribute "a=alt:&lt;id&gt;:&lt;SDP-Line&gt;"

            <t>The media-level attribute "a=alt-default-id:&lt;id&gt;"
            identifies the default configuration to be used in groupings.</t>

            <t>The session-level attribute "a=alt-group" is used to 
            group different recommended media alternatives. This allows 
            providing aggregated properties for the whole group 
            according to the grouping type.

        <t>The media-level SDP attribute "a=3GPP-Adaptation-Support" (see
        Section 5.3.3.5 in <xref target="PSS-234"></xref>) is defined as part of the
        negotiation procedure of the PSS adaptation mechanism. The attribute
        carries a single value indicating how often the RTCP "Next Application
        Data Unit" (NADU) APP packet shall be included in sent RTCP compound

        <t>The session- and media-level attribute "a=mbms-mode" (see Section 7.3.2.7 of
        <xref target="MBMS"></xref>) is used to describe MBMS broadcast mode
        media. The attribute may be used at the session level to set the default
        for all media and at the media level to specify differences between media.
        However, the attribute is never used at the session level when the session
        includes MBMS multicast mode media, nor at the media level to describe
        MBMS multicast mode media.</t>

      <section title="FEC Flow ID Attribute">
        <t>The media-level attribute "a=mbms-flowid" (see Section 8.3.1.9 of <xref
        target="MBMS"></xref>) maps one or more FEC source block flow IDs to
        their corresponding destination IP addresses and UDP port numbers. It
        is present in each SDP media block for repair packet streams.</t>

      <section title="MBMS Repair Attribute">
        <t>The session- and media-level attribute "a=mbms-repair" (see Section 8.3.1.8
        of <xref target="MBMS"></xref>) is used to provide FEC repair packets
        with non-FEC specific parameters. For Release 6, one such parameter
        is defined to specify the required minimum receiver buffer time.</t>

      <section anchor="sec-sdp-proto" title="SDP Protocol Identifiers for FEC">
        <t>MBMS defines a mechanism to provide block-based FEC for UDP-based

      <section title="Video Buffering Attribute">
        <t>The PSS media-level buffer attribute "a=X-initpredecbufperiod" (see
        <xref target="vba"/>) that specifies an initial buffering time is also used for
        MBMS in Release 7. It is mainly intended for video streams, but may be
        used for other media types as well (see Section 8.3.1.1 of <xref
        target="MBMS"></xref>).</t>

    <section title="SDP Offer/Answer Consideration">
      <t>The usage of the SDP attributes in an offer/answer <xref
      target="RFC3264"></xref> context is not defined. These SDP attributes
      are defined for use in a declarative context, and for PSS
      specifically in the RTSP <xref target="RFC2326"></xref> context.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="PSS RTSP Extensions">
      <t>The RTSP extensions for PSS consist of a number of new RTSP headers
      and option tags and a narrowing of URI usage in regards to 3GP files.
      The headers and option tags are informatively described here; see
      <xref target="PSS-234"/> for the normative declaration.</t>

      <section title="3GPP-Link-Char Header">
        <t>The "3GPP-Link-Char" header (see Section 5.3.2.1 of <xref
        target="PSS-234"></xref>) is used by clients to provide the server
        with QoS information about the wireless link it is currently using.
        The header can be used to provide the server with three different QoS
        parameters:<list style="symbols">
            <t>Guaranteed Bandwidth</t>

            <t>Maximum Bandwidth</t>

            <t>Maximum Transfer Delay</t>
          </list>The header may be included in RTSP requests using either of
        the methods SETUP, PLAY, OPTIONS, or SET_PARAMETER.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="3GPP-Adaptation Header">
        <t>The "3GPP-Adaptation" header (see Section 5.3.2.2 of <xref
        target="PSS-234"></xref>) is used by the client to provide the server
        with adaptation-related parameters and to indicate support of the
        adaptation function. The header carries the resource identification as
        a URI, the client's buffer size, and the desired target time.</t>

        <t>The header may be included in requests using the methods SETUP,
        PLAY, OPTIONS, and SET_PARAMETER. The response to a request using this
        method shall include this header.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="3GPP-QoE-Metrics Header">
        <t>The "3GPP-QoE-Metrics" header (see Section 5.3.2.3.1 of <xref
        target="PSS-234"></xref>) is used to negotiate the usage of the
        QoE metrics (see Section 11 of <xref
        target="PSS-234"></xref>).</t>

        <t>The header may be included in requests and responses using the
        SETUP, SET_PARAMETER, OPTIONS, or PLAY method.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="3GPP-QoE-Feedback Header">
        <t>The "3GPP-QoE-Feedback" header (see Section 5.3.2.3.2 of <xref
        target="PSS-234"></xref>) is used to carry QoE metrics from the client
        to the server when it reports, which happens either during or at the
        end of the media delivery.</t>

        <t>The header may be included in requests using the SET_PARAMETER,
        PAUSE, or TEARDOWN method.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Video Buffer Headers">
        <t>PSS uses several headers to provide the client with the different
        buffer parameters. They provide the buffer status at the point of a
        stream from which a PLAY request plays. These headers may only be used
        in PLAY responses. See Section 5.3.2.4 and Annex G of <xref
        target="PSS-234"></xref> for normative definitions.</t>

        <t>The three "x-" headers were defined in 3GPP Release 5. When it was
        realized that they should not have been given "x-" names, it was too
        late to rename them due to deployment.</t>

        <t>The RTSP headers are: <list style="symbols">
            <t>x-predecbufsize</t>

            <t>x-initpredecbufperiod</t>

            <t>x-initpostdecbufperiod</t>

          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Integrity Protection">
        <t>The integrity-protection mechanism defined in PSS Annex K uses the
        "3GPP-Freshness-Token" RTSP header (see Section K.2.2.4 of <xref
        target="PSS-234"></xref>) to carry a freshness token in
        DESCRIBE requests.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="RTSP URI Extension">
        <t>The PSS specification also defines syntax for referencing tracks
        within the 3GP file format <xref target="PSS-3GP"></xref>. The 3GP
        format is based on the ISO base media file format and is defined in
        several different profiles, including a streaming-server profile, in
        Release 6.</t>

        <t>This syntax is fully contained within the generic URI syntax
        defined for RTSP URIs. It is only a syntax restriction that server
        manufacturers follow to allow clients or proxies to understand what
        encodes the track number in the URI. This is provided for information
        only.</t>

        <t>To identify a track within a 3GP file, the last URI segment has to
        contain a structure that is &lt;alpha string&gt;=&lt;track nr&gt;. (See
        Section 5.3.3.1 of <xref target="PSS-234"></xref>.)</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Fast Start-Up and Content Switching">
        <t>Release 7 of PSS defines a number of extensions in terms of headers
        and option tags (see Section 5.5 of <xref target="PSS-234"></xref>)
        for support of fast start-up and switching of content for on-demand
        and live applications built on top of PSS. Clients are enabled to
        reuse the existing RTSP control session and RTP resources while
        switching to new content.</t>

        <t>The RTSP headers are: <list style="symbols">
            <t>Switch-Stream</t>

   Long form:          3GPP MBMS FEC-protected RTP/AVP over UDP
   Type of name:       proto
   Purpose:            3GPP MBMS defines a mechanism to provide block-
                       based FEC for UDP-based traffic.  This solution
                       uses the SDP protocol "proto" identifier to
                       identify the media streams that use the FEC
                       shim layer.  This protocol identifier indicates
                       that the FEC-protected data is RTP using the
                       AVP profile.

        <t>IANA has registered the RTSP headers listed below in the
        RTSP/1.0 Headers table of the "Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)/1.0
Parameters" registry available from http://www.iana.org/.</t>

        <t>Note: This registry requires a Standards document, preferably an IETF
        RFC. 

<!-- [rfced]
Please clarify this sentence (and thus the corresponding IANA registration 
procedure). Does "Standards document" mean a standards document in 
general, not the category "Standards Track"?  Does "IETF RFC" mean "RFC 
from the IETF stream"? (The text is referring to 
http://www.iana.org/assignments/rtsp-parameters/rtsp-parameters.xml.)

FYI, looking at RFC 2326 (which created this registry) there is not an 
occurrence of "IETF RFC".

Section 8.2:
  Note: This registry requires Standards document, preferably an IETF RFC.

Compare the IANA registry:
RTSP/1.0 Headers
(on http://www.iana.org/assignments/rtsp-parameters/rtsp-parameters.xml)

Registration Procedures
    Standards Document, preferable an IETF RFC
    
    
[Magnus] The thing is that RFC 2326 does have a IANA section and hasn't defined 
these registation rules. They are taken from a particular version of RTSP 2.0 draft
and simple implemented due to need for a registry. As this document and the IANA page
agrees I don't see that we can do anything better. If you are not happy then remove
the "Note"

The document that defines the registered headers below is a
        technical standards document from 3GPP, although the request for
        registration is submitted using this document to achieve further
        information spreading within IETF.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>SDP attributes are subject to modification by an attacker unless they
      are integrity protected and authenticated. The security considerations of
      the SDP specification <xref target="RFC4566"></xref> should be reviewed
      in this regard. The registered SDP attributes are vulnerable to
      modification attacks or removal, which may result in problems of a serious
      nature, including failure to use service and reduced quality.</t>

      <t>The registered RTSP headers are also vulnerable to insertion, deletion,
      or modification attacks similar to SDP attributes. Also in this case, attacks
      can result in failure of the service or reduced quality of streaming
      content.</t>

      <t>The three SDP protocol identifiers do not by themselves introduce any
      additional security threats that don't exist for other protocol
      identifiers in SDP. The media stream and the used protocols identified
      and configured by the SDP protocol identifier may, however, contain
      security issues by themselves.</t>
