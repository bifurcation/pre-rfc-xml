   This memo documents a DHCPv4 option that currently exists and was
   previously privately defined for the operation and usage of the
   Cisco Systems' Subnet Allocation Option for DHCPv4.

The option is passed
      between the DHCPv4 Client and the DHCPv4 Server to request dynamic
      allocation of a subnet, give specifications of the subnet(s) allocated, and
      report usage statistics. This memo documents the current usage of the
      option in agreement with RFC 3942, which declares
      that any preexisting usages of option numbers in the range 128-223
      should be documented and that the working group will try to officially assign
      those numbers to those options.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This memo documents a DHCP option <xref target="RFC2132"></xref>, the
      Subnet Allocation option, that was developed by Cisco and allows a DHCP
      Client to allocate a subnet given information from a DHCP Server. This
      protocol makes use of DHCP option number 220, one of the option numbers
      reclassified by <xref target="RFC3942"/>. That RFC specifies in Section 4, procedure 2,
      "Vendors that currently use one or more of the reclassified options have
      6 months following this RFC's publication date to notify the DHC WG and
      IANA that they are using particular options numbers and agree to
      document that usage in an RFC". This memo serves as that documentation.
      The DHC WG has had no input into any of the details of the protocol
      operation and makes no statement about the correctness or any other
      aspect of the protocol. The WG also has seen no interest in further
      implementation or deployment of this protocol other than privately, and
      therefore has decided to publish this document solely for informational
      purposes.</t>

      <t>The Subnet Allocation option provides a straightforward way to
      allocate a subnet from DHCP, useful for a simple Dial-in Aggregation box,
      or to implement a Hierarchical chain of DHCP Servers, each one in turn
      leasing one or more subnets to the next DHCP Server down the chain. This
      option is specified in such a way as to use one DHCP option number,
      while using suboption numbers for each function.</t>

Flags = Flags field. (all unused bits must be zero)

              from this subnet.

Prefix = Network prefix length requested
         (0 means no suggested length is given) (1 octet)]]></artwork>

        <t></t>

        <t>The DHCP Server SHOULD NOT include the Subnet Request suboption in
        any replies to the DHCP Client. Enough information will be present in
        the Subnet-Information suboption, such that the Subnet Request
        suboption is not needed in replies to the Client.</t>

        <t>The DHCP Server SHOULD allocate a subnet with prefix length <xref
        target="RFC4632"> </xref> less than or equal to the "Prefix" field
        length specified in the request. In other words, a subnet containing a
        number of addresses at least the size indicated by the prefix length
        requested and possibly more. 
The DHCP Server MAY allocate a subnet with a prefix
length greater than that specified in the request (or a subnet with a
number of addresses less than requested), but this is not encouraged.
 </t>

        <t>A "Prefix" field size of 0 MAY be specified by the DHCP Client. In
        this case, no suggested prefix length is given.</t>

        <t>Multiple Subnet-Request suboptions in a DHCP packet indicate that
        multiple subnets are being requested. Note that multiple occurrences
        of this suboption MUST NOT be concatenated in the sense of <xref
        target="RFC3396"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Each Subnet-Request suboption MUST result in no more than one
        Subnet-Information suboption in the DHCPOFFER message from the Server,
        and may result in no Subnet-Information suboptions.</t>

        <t>The Client MAY also include the Subnet-Information suboption in
        order to request a particular subnet. In this case, the Client SHOULD
        only include one Subnet-Request suboption, since it would otherwise be
        unclear which Subnet-Information suboption referred to which
        Subnet-Request suboption. Multiple subnet requests can be made by
        sending multiple DHCPDISCOVER packets.</t>

        <t>Setting the 'h' flag to 1 indicates the Client will be allocating
        addresses from the allocated subnet(s) itself. This can be thought of
        as a "Hierarchical DHCP" design in that control of allocation for the
        subnet(s) will be passed to the Client.</t>

        <t>Setting the 'h' flag to 0 indicates the Client wants the DHCP
        Server to retain control over allocation of addresses from the
        subnet(s). Any address allocation requests on the subnet will be
        relayed back to the DHCP Server.</t>

        <t>Setting the 'i' flag to 1 indicates the Client is NOT seeking
        allocation of any subnets, but is simply seeking information from the
        Server as to what subnet(s) have been allocated (or reserved) for this
        Client. If the 'i' flag is set to 1, then the "Prefix" field SHOULD be
        set to 0 and MUST be ignored by the Server. In this case, the
        conversation between the Client and the Server will only progress to
        the DHCPOFFER packet from the Server, giving the information, as
        described in <xref target="sec_client_requesting"/> below.</t>

        <t>Any undefined flags (those other than 'i' and 'h', mentioned above)
        should be ignored by the DHCP Server.</t>

              (or has been echoed back by the Client, when asking
              for the next previously allocated subnet from the

              Client.

        <t>Setting the 'c' flag to 1 indicates this Subnet-Information
        suboption is in response to a Client request for information from the
        Server as to what subnet(s) have been allocated. This flag is used in
        response to a Subnet-Request suboption with the 'i' flag set and
        should be 0 in other Server responses. Note, the flag is echoed back
        from the Client to the Server when requesting the "next previously
        allocated subnet". Another way to think of the 'c' bit would be that
        it indicates that the subnet information contained in this suboption
        does not represent a new allocation by the Server or a new request for
        allocation by the Client, but instead represents previously allocated
        subnet information.</t>

        <t>Setting the 's' flag to 1 indicates the Server has additional
        subnet information for the Client.</t>

        <t>Any undefined flags (those other than 'c' and 's', mentioned above)
        should be ignored by the DHCP Server.</t>

        <t>The Subnet-Information suboption is used by the DHCP Server in
        order to return information as to what subnets are offered (in the
        case of a DHCPOFFER packet) or allocated (in the case of a DHCPACK
        packet). As is indicated above, multiple subnets may be returned in
        one Subnet-Information suboption.</t>

        <t>The Subnet-Information suboption is also used by the DHCP Client in
        order to request allocation of specific subnets in a DHCPREQUEST
        packet. In this case, the "Network", "Prefix", and "Flags" fields
        contained in the associated Subnet Prefix Information blocks MUST NOT
        be changed from the information that was received in the DHCPOFFER
        packet from the Server. The Client MAY, however, use multiple
        Subnet-Information suboptions in order to request subnets that were
        originally specified by the Server inside one Subnet-Information
        suboption.</t>

Network = IPv4 network number (4 octets)
Prefix  = Prefix length (1 octet)
Flags   = Flags field (Undefined bits must be zero) (1 octet)

    'd' = Deprecate flag (explained below)
          1 : Deprecation of this subnet is requested.
          0 : No deprecation is needed.

    'h' = Hierarchical flag (explained below)
          1 : Client will be allocating addresses from this subnet.
          0 : Client will be relaying DHCP requests to the Server
              from this subnet.

Stat-len = Length of the optional statistics information field
           (zero if no statistics are included) (1 octet)]]></artwork>
          </figure>

          <t>The 'd' flag may only be returned by the Server to the Client
          (inside a DHCPACK packet, in response to a DHCP RENEW). Its
          presence means that the Client should prepare to give up the subnet.
          For example, if the Client is assigning addresses from this subnet
          to other Clients, it should cease doing so immediately and should
          not renew any leases when Clients ask for renewal. As soon as all
          addresses in the subnet are unallocated, the Client should send a
          DHCPRELEASE message to the Server, including a Subnet Prefix
          Information block for the subnet in order to release the subnet.
          The format of this message is described farther below.</t>

          <t>The 'h' flag tells the Client how the Server intends for the
          Client to use the allocated subnet. It is interpreted in the same
          manner as that in the Subnet-Request suboption. In response to a
          Subnet-Request, the Server should normally specify the 'h' flag in
          the same manner as it was in the Subnet-Request suboption from the
          Client. The Server MAY, however, change the 'h' flag from that
          specified in the Subnet-Request suboption if it has been configured
          to override the Client's request.</t>

          <t>Any undefined flags (those other than 'd' and 'h', mentioned
          above) should be ignored by the DHCP Server.</t>

          <t>If any usage statistics information is to be included, then the
          "Stat-len" field specifies the number of bytes of statistics
          information that is included. See below for more information. If no
          statistics information is included, then this byte MUST be zero. The
          "Stat-len" field SHOULD always be zero when this suboption is sent
          by the DHCP Server. The usage statistics information is intended for
          use only to report usage statistics from the Client to the
          Server.</t>

          <section title="Subnet Usage Statistics">
            <t>The Subnet-Information suboption may also include usage
            statistics information. If this information is included, then the

            bytes of statistics information that is being included. The
            statistics information MUST be in the following form and

        <t>If included, this suboption MUST appear only once. (Inclusion of
        multiple such suboptions would result in ambiguity as to which applied
        to which subnet.) If different suggested lease times are needed, the
        Server SHOULD, instead, reply with only one offered subnet and should
        set the "Server flag" in the Subnet-Information suboption to indicate
        to the Client that it should send another subnet request to gather the
        others.</t>

        <t>The Client SHOULD use a lease time, when allocating addresses from
        the subnet, that is the lesser of the remaining lease time of the
        subnet itself and the Suggested-Lease-Time suboption.</t>

    <section title="Requesting Allocation of a Subnet">
      <section title="Client DHCPDISCOVER Message">
        <t>The DHCP Client creates a DHCPDISCOVER message including the Subnet
        Allocation option, and its set of suboptions, to request allocation of
        a subnet. The DHCP Client should include the Subnet-Request suboption,
        specifying the prefix length of the subnet requested. The 'h' bit
        should be set to 1 if the Client intends to control allocation of
        addresses within the subnet itself, or 0 if the Server should retain
        control of addresses within the subnet. More than one Subnet
        Allocation option may appear in a DHCPDISCOVER message; however, the
        Client SHOULD limit the number of requests, noting that the DHCP
        replies will need to include the Subnet-Information suboption, which
        takes up more space than the Subnet-Request suboption.</t>

        <t>If more than one subnet is being requested, multiple Subnet-Request
        suboptions MAY be included or multiple DHCPDISCOVER messages MAY be
        sent instead. The prefix length field of each Subnet-Request suboption
        MUST be either 0, or in the range of 1 to 30 inclusive.</t>

        <t>The DHCP "IP address lease time" option (code 51) MAY be included
        in the DHCPDISCOVER message to specify the lease time the Client is
        requesting for the subnet. If not present, no suggested lease time is
        given.</t>

        <t>The DHCP "Client ID" option (code 61) MAY be included in the
        DHCPDISCOVER message as it may be used by the Server in performing the
        subnet allocation.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Server DHCPOFFER Message">
        <t>Upon receiving a DHCPDISCOVER containing the Subnet Allocation
        option, the DHCP Server SHOULD respond with a DHCPOFFER message
        including the Subnet-Information suboption in order to specify the
        subnet(s) that it is willing to allocate to the Client in order to
        fulfill the request(s).</t>

        <t>The Server need not reserve the subnets that are being offered,
        but SHOULD not offer the same subnets to another DHCP Client until a
        reasonable time period (implementation dependent) has passed. (This is
        similar to normal DHCP address allocation.)</t>

        <t>The Server MUST NOT include the Subnet-Request suboption in the
        DHCPOFFER. The same information is already present in the Subnet
        Information suboption(s) that SHOULD be included in the
        DHCPOFFER.</t>

        <t>The Server SHOULD also include the IP address lease time option
        (option 51) in the DHCPOFFER message. This gives the lease time for
        all subnets given in all Subnet-Request suboptions contained in the
        DHCPOFFER message. 
The Server MAY also include the Renewal and/or 
Rebinding options in order to further control the "T1" and "T2" lease 
timers of the Client. There MUST be exactly one IP address lease time (and
optionally one Rebinding and/or one Renewal option) in the DHCPOFFER message.
</t>


        <t>The Server MAY set the "Server flag" ('s') to 1 to indicate that it
        would like to allocate one or more additional subnet(s) to the Client.
        This indicates that the Client should send another DHCPDISCOVER
        message specifying a prefix length field, P, of zero in order to request
        the additional subnet allocation(s) information. This may be necessary
        if the subnets are to be allocated with different lease times, for
        example.</t>

        <t>The "Client flag" ('c') MUST be set to 0 to indicate this is a
        Server response to a Client request for a new subnet allocation and
        not a response to a request for information about already allocated
        subnets.</t>

        <t>
   If the packet contains a Subnet Allocation option, the Server SHOULD
   set the DHCP yiaddr value to all zeros (0.0.0.0) and the Client
   MUST ignore fields having to do with address assignment.
In other words, a
        DHCP packet exchange cannot provide subnet allocation and address
        assignment simultaneously.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Client DHCPREQUEST Message">
        <t>When sending a DHCPREQUEST, the Client MUST NOT modify any fields
        of any Subnet-Information suboptions received from the Server.
        However, the Client MAY choose not to include some Subnet-Information
        suboptions when issuing the DHCPREQUEST. Subnet-Request suboptions
        MUST NOT be included in the DHCPREQUEST message; only the
        Subnet-Information suboption(s) should be included.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Server DHCPACK Message">
        <t>The DHCP Server, upon receipt of the Client's DHCPREQUEST message,
        MAY refuse allocation of any subnets (for example, if they have been
        allocated elsewhere in the meantime); however, since the Server should
        have set aside the subnets offered for a short period of time, and
        since the Client should have requested the subnets within a short
        period of time after receiving the offer(s) from the Server(s), this
        last minute rejection should be rare. The DHCP Server MUST NOT change
        the network number(s) or prefix length(s); however, it MAY remove some
        Subnet-Information suboptions from the list.</t>

        <t>The Server SHOULD include the IP address lease time option
        specifying the lease period for all subnet(s) in the DHCPACK. All
        subnets allocated in one DHCP message will have the same lease time,
        and only one IP address lease time option must appear in the DHCP
        message.</t>

        <t>If the Server has internal information that states that the Client
        should be allocated more subnets than were requested, the Server MAY
        set the 's' bit in the last Subnet-Information suboption to indicate
        that the Client needs to request more subnets (as described
        above).</t>

        <t>The allocable unit is the tuple (network number, prefix length).
        Multiple subnets may be allocated in one DHCPACK; however, since there
        can be only one Lease-time option, each subnet allocated is assigned
        the same lease time. Each subnet lease tuple (network number, prefix
        length) MAY be renewed or released individually.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Client Renewal of Subnet Lease">
      <section title="Client RENEW DHCPREQUEST Message">
        <t>The Client MUST renew all subnets allocated with a lease time in
        much the same manner as renewing an allocated IP address. Renewal
        timers need not be set in exactly the same manner, however. If Renewal
        and/or Rebinding options were included in the DHCPACK of the subnet
        allocation, then these "T1" and "T2" timers should be used just as
        they would be in the case of address allocation timers.</t>

        <t>The DHCPREQUEST message MUST include a Subnet-Information suboption
        for which the Client is seeking renewal of the lease. This
        Subnet-Information suboption may optionally include subnet usage
        statistics, as described above in
        <xref target="sec_subnet_information"/> ("Subnet-Information
        Suboption Format").</t>

        <t>The subnet network number field ("Network") and subnet prefix
        length field ("Prefix") MUST agree with the values as they were
        originally allocated to the Client by the Server. In any of the
        statistics fields (High water, Currently in use, Unusable), a value of all ones
        (0xffff) SHOULD be used if the Client has no information to report for
        a statistic.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Server RENEW DHCPREQUEST Response">
        <t>The Server MAY respond to a subnet RENEW with either a DHCPACK or
        DHCPNAK response. If a DHCPNAK response is given, the Client MUST
        immediately stop using the subnet(s) specified and, if possible,
        notify all Clients with addresses allocated from this subnet that
        their addresses are no longer valid. The Client MAY, of course, send a
        DHCPDISCOVER message containing the Subnet Allocation option and the
        Subnet-Request suboption in order to acquire another subnet for use.
        In general, the Server should ask the Client to deprecate subnets by
        using the 'd' bit of the Subnet-Information suboption in a DHCPACK
        message (see below).</t>

        <t>If a DHCPACK response is given, the "Deprecate" ('d') bit of the
        Flags field in the Subnet-Information suboption may also be set. This
        indicates the DHCP Client should prepare to stop using this
        subnet.

        If the Client is allocating IP addresses for other Clients from this
        subnet (e.g., via DHCP), the Client SHOULD immediately stop allocating
        such addresses. Once all allocated addresses in the subnet have been
        released, the Client SHOULD send a DHCPRELEASE message, including the
        Subnet-Information suboption (with optional usage statistics) in order
        to release the subnet(s) back to the Server.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Client DHCPRELEASE Message">
        <t>The DHCP Client SHOULD send a DHCPRELEASE message in order to
        release allocated subnet(s) back to the Server when it is finished
        using them. This message MUST NOT include the Subnet-Request
        suboption, but MUST include one or more Subnet-Information suboptions,
        and may optionally include usage statistics.</t>

        <t>The Client MUST release the same subnet(s) of the same prefix
        length ("Prefix"), as were originally allocated. The Client MAY release
        a subset of the subnets that were allocated originally. In other
        words, the allocable unit is the tuple (network number, prefix
        length). Multiple subnets may be allocated in one DHCPACK; however,

        message, the DHCP Client MUST issue a DHCPREQUEST message to the DHCP
        Server in order to renew the lease on the subnet mentioned. No other
        subnets allocated to the Client are affected. As is the case with all
        DHCP RENEW messages, the Client may include subnet usage information
        in the Subnet-Information suboption in order to report subnet usage
        statistics, or set the "Stat-len" field to 0 if no statistics are to
        be reported.</t>

        to 1 to indicate that the Client is seeking already allocated subnet
        information from the Server. No Subnet-Information suboptions should

        Client.</t>

        <t>The Server SHOULD, internally, retain an ordered list of subnets

        suboption), the Server returns in the DHCPOFFER message the subnet
        information for the first subnet(s) from this list. If the end of the
        list has been reached, then the 's' bit of the last Subnet-Information
        suboption included in the message MUST be set to 0. If there are more
        subnets in the list, the 's' bit MUST be set to 1 to indicate to the
        Client that more information is available. Since this information is
        in response to a Client request for previously allocated subnet
        information, the 'c' bit MUST be set to 1.</t>

    <section title="Differences from DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation">
      <t>The following differences may be noticed between Subnet Allocation as
      described in this document and DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation as described in
      <xref target="RFC3633"></xref>:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>This option does not use anything like an "IA_PD" as is used in
          DHCPv6.</t>

          <t>If the Server cannot allocate a subnet, it remains silent,
          instead of returning a special response saying nothing is
          available.</t>

          <t>DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation has no mechanism for returning
          subnet/prefix usage statistics.</t>

          <t>DHCPv6 has no equivalent to the "subnet deprecation" flag as
          described here.</t>

          <t>DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation makes no mention of what Client actions
          should result from receiving a DHCPNAK during a RENEW of a
          delegation.</t>

          <t>DHCPv6 has no equivalent of the subnet allocation "Network name"
          suboption, which may be used by the Server for various purposes,
          such as to specify a pool to use when allocating a subnet.</t>

          <t>DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation corresponds to "Hierarchical Subnet
          Allocation" (setting the 'h' flag in the Prefix Information
          block).

 There is no v6 equivalent of clearing the 'h' flag, in
          which the Server retains authority over allocation of addresses from
          the subnet.</t>

          <t>DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation has nothing to correspond to the
          Suggested-Lease-Time suboption.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Potential exposures to attack are discussed in Section 7 of the DHCP
      protocol specification <xref target="RFC2131"></xref>. The Subnet
      Allocation option can be used to hoard all allocable subnets on a
      network.</t>

      <t>Implementations should consider using the DHCP Authentication option
      <xref target="RFC3118"></xref> in order to provide a higher level of
      security if it is deemed necessary in their environment.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA has assigned DHCP option number 220 for this option,
      in accordance with <xref target="RFC3942"></xref>.</t>

      <t>No assignment of values for the suboption codes need be made at this
      time. New values may only be defined by IETF Consensus, as described in
      <xref target="RFC5226"></xref>. Basically, this means that they are
      defined by RFCs approved by the IESG.</t>
