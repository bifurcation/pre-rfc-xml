    <abstract>
      <t>Annex E of the Digital Video Broadcasting - IPTV (DVB-IPTV) technical
      specification defines an optional Application-Layer Forward Error
      Correction (AL-FEC) protocol to protect the streaming media transported using
      RTP. The DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol uses two layers for FEC
      protection. The first (base) layer is based on the 1-D interleaved
      parity code. The second (enhancement) layer is based on the Raptor code.
      By offering a layered approach, the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol offers
      good protection against both bursty and random packet losses at a cost
      of decent complexity. This document describes how one can implement the
      DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol by using the 1-D interleaved parity code and
      Raptor code that have already been specified in separate documents.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In 2007, the IP Infrastructure (IPI) Technical Module (TM) of the
      Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) consortium published a technical
      specification <xref target="ETSI-TS-102-034v1.3.1"> </xref> through the
      European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). <xref
      target="ETSI-TS-102-034v1.3.1"></xref> covers several areas related to
      the transmission of MPEG2 transport stream-based services over IP
      networks.</t>

      <t>Annex E of <xref target="ETSI-TS-102-034v1.3.1"></xref> defines
      an optional protocol for Application-Layer Forward Error Correction
      (AL-FEC) to protect the streaming media for DVB-IP services transported
using RTP <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>. In 2009, DVB updated the
      specification in a new revision that is available as <xref
      target="ETSI-TS-102-034v1.4.1"></xref>. Among others, some updates and
      modifications to the AL-FEC protocol have been made. This document
      describes how one can implement the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol by using
      the 1-D interleaved parity code <xref
      target="RFC6015"></xref> and Raptor
      code specifications <xref target="RFC6681"></xref>
      <xref target="RFC6682"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol uses two layers for protection: a base
      layer that is produced by the 1-D interleaved parity code (also simply
      referred to as "parity code" in the remainder of this document), and an
      enhancement layer that is produced by the Raptor code. Whenever a
      receiver supports the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol, the decoding support for
      the base-layer FEC is mandatory while the decoding support for the
      enhancement-layer FEC is optional. Both the interleaved parity code and
      the Raptor code are systematic FEC codes, meaning that source packets
      are not modified in any way during the FEC encoding process.</t>

      <t>The DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol considers protection of single-sequence
      source RTP flows only. In the AL-FEC protocol, the source stream can
      only be an MPEG-2 transport stream. The FEC data at each layer are
      generated based on some configuration information, which also determines
      the exact associations and relationships between the source and repair
      packets. This document shows how this configuration may be communicated
      out-of-band in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref
      target="RFC4566"></xref>.</t>

      <t>In DVB-IPTV AL-FEC, the source packets are carried in the source RTP
      stream and the generated FEC repair packets at each layer are carried in
      separate streams. At the receiver side, if all of the source packets are
      successfully received, there is no need for FEC recovery and the repair
      packets may be discarded. However, if there are missing source packets,
      the repair packets can be used to recover the missing information.</t>

      <t>The block diagram of the encoder side for the systematic DVB-IPTV
      AL-FEC protection is described in <xref target="fig_encoder"></xref>.
      Here, the source packets are fed into the parity encoder to produce the
      parity repair packets. The source packets may also be fed to the Raptor
      encoder to produce the Raptor repair packets. Source packets as well as
      the repair packets are then sent to the receiver(s) over an IP
      network.</t>

      This is a minimum performance decoder since the receiver only supports

      source packets by using the base-layer repair packets.</t>

    <section anchor="sec_al_fec" title="DVB-IPTV AL-FEC Specification">
      <t>The DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol comprises two layers of FEC protection:
      1-D interleaved parity FEC for the base layer and Raptor FEC for the
      enhancement layer. The performance of these FEC codes has been examined
      in detail in <xref target="DVB-A115"></xref>.</t>

      <section anchor="sec_baselayer" title="Base-Layer FEC">
        <t>The 1-D interleaved parity FEC uses the exclusive OR (XOR)
        operation to generate the repair symbols. In a group of D x L source
        packets, the XOR operation is applied to each group of D source
        packets whose sequence numbers are L apart from each other to generate
        a total of L repair packets. Due to interleaving, this FEC is
        effective against bursty packet losses up to burst sizes of length
        L.</t>

        <t>The DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol requires that the D x L block of the source
        packets protected by the 1-D interleaved FEC code be wholly
        contained within a single source block of the Raptor code, if both FEC
        layers are used.</t>

        <t>Originally, the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol had adopted the 1-D
        interleaved FEC payload format from <xref target="SMPTE2022-1"></xref>
        in <xref target="ETSI-TS-102-034v1.3.1"></xref>. However, some
        incompatibilities with RTP <xref target="RFC3550"></xref> have been
        discovered in this specification. These issues have all been addressed
        in <xref target="RFC6015"></xref>
        (for details, refer to Section 1 of <xref
        target="RFC6015"></xref>). Some of
        the changes required by <xref
        target="RFC6015"></xref> are,
        however, not backward compatible with the existing implementations
        that were based on <xref target="SMPTE2022-1"></xref>.</t>

        <t>In a recent liaison statement from the IETF AVT WG to DVB TM-IPI, it has been
        recommended that DVB TM-IPI define a new RTP profile for the AL-FEC
        protocol since in the new profile, several of the issues could easily
        be addressed without jeopardizing the compliance to RTP <xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref>.</t>

        <t>At the writing of this document, it was not clear whether or not a
        new RTP profile would be defined for the AL-FEC protocol. DVB TM-IPI
        attempted to address some of the issues in the updated specification
        <xref target="ETSI-TS-102-034v1.4.1"></xref>; however, there are still
        outstanding issues.</t>

        <t>The following is a list of the exceptions that need to be
        considered by an implementation adopting <xref
        target="RFC6015"></xref> to be
        compliant with the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol as specified in <xref
        target="ETSI-TS-102-034v1.4.1"></xref>.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>SSRC  (synchronization source)<vspace blankLines="0" />The DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol
            requires that the SSRC fields of the FEC packets be set to
            zero.<vspace blankLines="1" />This requirement conflicts with RTP
            <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>. Unless signaled otherwise, RTP
            uses random SSRC values with collision detection. An explicit SSRC
            signaling mechanism is currently defined in <xref
            target="RFC5576"></xref> and can be used for this purpose.</t>

            <t>CSRC (contributing source)<vspace blankLines="0" />The DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol does
            not support the protection of the CSRC entries in the source
            packets. Thus, in an implementation compliant to DVB-IPTV AL-FEC
            protocol, the source stream must not have any CSRC entries in its
            packets, and subsequently the CC fields of the source RTP packets
            will be zero.<vspace blankLines="1" />Note that if there are no
            RTP mixers used in a system running the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol,
            the CC field of the source RTP packets will be zero and this is no
            longer an issue. Thus, if defined, the new RTP profile for the
            DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol should forbid the use of any RTP
            mixers.</t>

            <t>Timestamp<vspace blankLines="0" />In the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC
            protocol, the timestamp fields of the FEC packets are ignored by
            the receivers.</t>

            <t>Payload Type<vspace blankLines="0" />The DVB-IPTV AL-FEC
            protocol sets the PT fields of the FEC packets to 96. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />A static payload type assignment for the
            base-layer FEC packets is outside the scope of <xref
            target="RFC6015"></xref>. If
            defined, the new RTP profile for the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol may
            assign 96 as the payload type for the base-layer FEC packets.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In implementations that are based on <xref
        target="RFC6015"></xref> and are
        willing to be compliant with the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol as
        specified in <xref target="ETSI-TS-102-034v1.3.1"></xref>, all these
        exceptions must be considered as well; however, in this case, the
        sender does not have to select a random initial sequence number for
        the FEC stream as suggested by <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Note that neither <xref target="ETSI-TS-102-034v1.3.1"></xref> nor
        <xref target="ETSI-TS-102-034v1.4.1"></xref> implements the 1-D
        interleaved parity code as specified in <xref
        target="RFC6015"></xref>. Thus, the
        payload format registered in <xref
        target="RFC6015"></xref> must not be
        used by the implementations that are compliant with the <xref
        target="ETSI-TS-102-034v1.3.1"></xref> or <xref
        target="ETSI-TS-102-034v1.4.1"></xref> specification.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Enhancement-Layer FEC">
        <t>The Raptor code is a fountain code where as many encoding symbols
        as needed can be generated by the encoder on-the-fly from source data.
        Due to the fountain property of the Raptor code, multiple enhancement
        layers may also be specified, if needed.</t>

        <t>The details of the Raptor code are provided in <xref target="RFC6681"></xref>. 
The FEC scheme for the enhancement layer SHALL be the Raptor FEC scheme for a
Single Sequenced Flow with FEC encoding ID 5.  The RTP payload format for
Raptor FEC is specified in <xref target="RFC6682"></xref>.</t>

        <t>It is important to note that the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol in the
        latest specification <xref target="ETSI-TS-102-034v1.4.1"></xref>
        allows both UDP-only and RTP-over-UDP encapsulations for the
        enhancement-layer FEC stream. The initial specification <xref
        target="ETSI-TS-102-034v1.3.1"></xref> exclusively permits UDP-only
        encapsulation for the enhancement-layer FEC stream.</t>

        <t>When SDP is used for signaling, the transport protocol identifier
        indicates whether an RTP-over-UDP or UDP-only
        encapsulation is used. In case of any other signaling framework, the
        differentiation of the protocol for the enhancement-layer stream is
        achieved either explicitly through a protocol identifier or implicitly
        by the version number of the DVB IPTV Handbook. If none of the above
        signaling is provided, the receiver shall concur from the packet size
        of the repair packets if RTP-over-UDP or UDP-only encapsulation is
        used.</t>

      <section anchor="sec_hybrid_decoding" title="Hybrid Decoding Procedures">
        <t>The receivers that support receiving and decoding both the base- and
        enhancement-layer FEC perform hybrid decoding to improve the repair
        performance. The following steps may be followed to perform hybrid
        decoding:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Base-layer (Parity) Decoding: In this step, the repair packets
            that are encoded by the parity encoder are processed as usual to
            repair as many missing source packets as possible.</t>

            <t>Enhancement-layer (Raptor) Decoding: If there are still missing
            source packets after the first step, the repair packets that are
            Raptor encoded are processed with the source packets already
            received and the source packets that are recovered in the first
            step.</t>

            <t>Hybrid Decoding: If there are still missing source packets
            after the second step, the unprocessed base-layer (parity) repair
            packets are converted to a form in which they can be added to the
            Raptor decoding process. With this additional information, Raptor
            decoding may potentially recover any remaining missing source
            packet.</t>
          </list>The procedure that should be followed to benefit from the
        base-layer repair packets in the Raptor decoding process is explained
        in detail in Annex E.5.2 of <xref

    <section title="Session Description Protocol (SDP) Signaling">
      <t>This section provides an SDP <xref target="RFC4566"></xref> example
      for <xref target="ETSI-TS-102-034v1.4.1"></xref>. The example uses the
      FEC grouping semantics <xref
      target="RFC5956"></xref>.</t>

      <t>In the example, we have one source video stream (mid:S1), one FEC
      repair stream (mid:R1) that is produced by the 1-D interleaved parity
      FEC code, as well as another FEC repair stream (mid:R2) that is produced
      by the Raptor FEC code. We form one FEC group with the "a=group:FEC-FR S1
R1 R2" line. The source and repair streams are sent to the same port
      on different multicast groups. The source, base-layer FEC, and
      enhancement-layer FEC streams are all encapsulated in RTP.</t>

      <t>Due to the exceptions described in <xref
      target="sec_baselayer"></xref>, a <xref

      <t>Note that in the example above, the payload type has been chosen as
      96 for the base-layer FEC stream and there is no "a=fmtp:" line to
      specify the format parameters. Due to the lack of the format parameters
      for "vnd.dvb.iptv.alfec-base", it is not possible to learn the FEC
      parameters from the SDP description.</t>

<title>RTP Payload Format for 1-D Interleaved Parity Forward Error Correction (FEC)</title>
<author initials='A.' surname='Begen' fullname='A. Begen'>
<organization /></author>
<date year='2010' month='October' />
<abstract>
<t>This document defines a new RTP payload format for the Forward Error Correction (FEC) that is generated by the 1-D interleaved parity code from a source media encapsulated in RTP.  The 1-D interleaved parity code is a systematic code, where a number of repair symbols are generated from a set of source symbols and sent in a repair flow separate from the source flow that carries the source symbols.  The 1-D interleaved parity code offers a good protection against bursty packet losses at a cost of reasonable complexity.  The new payload format defined in this document should only be used (with some exceptions) as a part of the Digital Video Broadcasting-IPTV (DVB- IPTV) Application-layer FEC specification.

<abstract><t>This document describes Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction (FEC) Schemes for the Raptor and RaptorQ codes and their application to reliable delivery of media streams in the context of FEC Framework.  The Raptor and RaptorQ codes are systematic codes, where a number of repair symbols are generated from a set of source symbols and sent in one or more repair flows in addition to the source symbols that are sent to the receiver(s) within a source flow.  The Raptor and RaptorQ codes offer close to optimal protection against arbitrary packet losses at a low computational complexity.  Six FEC Schemes are defined, two for protection of arbitrary packet flows, two that are optimised for small source blocks and another two for protection of a single flow that already contains a sequence number. Repair data may be sent over arbitrary datagram transport (e.g.  UDP) or using RTP.</t></abstract>

<title>Forward Error Correction Grouping Semantics in the Session Description Protocol</title>
<author initials='A.' surname='Begen' fullname='A. Begen'>
<organization /></author>
<date year='2010' month='September' />
<abstract>
<t>This document defines the semantics for grouping the associated source and FEC-based (Forward Error Correction) repair flows in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).  The semantics defined in this document are to be used with the SDP Grouping Framework (RFC 5888).  These semantics allow the description of grouping relationships between the source and repair flows when one or more source and/or repair flows are associated in the same group, and they provide support for additive repair flows.  SSRC-level (Synchronization Source) grouping semantics are also defined in this document for Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) streams using SSRC multiplexing.
