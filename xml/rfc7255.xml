        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>This specification defines how the Uniform Resource Name (URN)
reserved for the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA)
identities and its sub-namespace for the International Mobile station 
Equipment Identity (IMEI) as specified in RFC 7254 <xref target="RFC7254"/>
can be used as an instance-id as specified in RFC 5626
<xref target="RFC5626"/> and also as used by RFC 5627
<xref target="RFC5627"/>.</t>  

             <t>RFC 5626 <xref target="RFC5626"/> specifies the
'+sip.instance' Contact header field parameter that contains a URN as
specified in RFC 2141 <xref target="RFC2141"/>. The instance-id uniquely
identifies a specific User Agent (UA) instance. This instance-id is used as
specified in RFC 5626 <xref target="RFC5626"/> so that the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) registrar (as specified in
RFC 3261 <xref target="RFC3261"/>) can recognize that the contacts from
multiple registrations correspond to the same UA. The instance-id is also
used as specified by RFC 5627 <xref target="RFC5627"/> to create
Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs) that can be used to uniquely
address a UA when multiple UAs are registered with the same Address
             of Record (AoR).</t>

             <t>RFC 5626 <xref target="RFC5626"/> requires that a UA SHOULD
create a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) URN as specified in
RFC 4122 <xref target="RFC4122"/> as its instance-id but allows for the
possibility to use other URN schemes. Per RFC 5626, "If a URN scheme
other than UUID is used, the UA MUST only use URNs for which an RFC
(from the IETF stream) defines how the specific URN needs to be
constructed and used in the "+sip.instance" Contact header field
parameter for outbound behavior". This specification meets this requirement
by specifying how the GSMA IMEI URN is used in the '+sip.instance' Contact 
header field parameter for outbound behavior, and RFC 7254
<xref target="RFC7254"/>  specifies how the GSMA IMEI URN is constructed.</t>
          
                  <t>The GSMA IMEI is a URN for the IMEI -- a globally unique
identifier that identifies mobile devices used in the GSM, Universal
Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), and 3rd Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks. The IMEI allocation is
managed by the GSMA to ensure that the IMEI values are globally unique.
Details of the formatting of the IMEI as a URN are specified in
RFC 7254 <xref target="RFC7254"/>, and the definition of the IMEI is
contained in 3GPP TS 23.003 <xref target="refs.TS-23.003"/>. Further details
about the GSMA's role in allocating the IMEI, and the IMEI allocation
guidelines, can be found in GSMA PRD TS.06 <xref target="refs.DG.06"/>. </t>

        </section>
                
        <section title="Background">
                    <t>GSM, UMTS, and LTE capable mobile devices represent
90% of the mobile devices in use worldwide. Every manufactured GSM, UMTS,
or LTE mobile device has an allocated IMEI that uniquely identifies this
specific mobile device. Among other things, in some regulatory jurisdictions
the IMEI is used to identify that a stolen mobile device is being used, to
help to identify the subscription that is using it, and to prevent use
of the mobile device. While GSM was originally a circuit switched system,
enhancements such as the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and UMTS
have added IP data capabilities that, along with the definition of the
IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), have made SIP-based calls and IP
multimedia sessions from mobile devices possible.</t>

               <t>The latest enhancement, known as LTE, introduces even
higher data rates and dispenses with the circuit switched infrastructure
completely. This means that with LTE networks, voice calls will need to be
conducted using IP and IMS. However, the transition to all IP SIP-based IMS
networks worldwide will take a great many years, and mobile devices, being
mobile, will need to operate in both IP/SIP/IMS mode and circuit switched
mode. This means that calls and sessions will need to be handed over
between IP/SIP/IMS mode and circuit switched mode mid-call or mid-session.
Also, since many existing GSM and UMTS radio access networks are unable to
support IP/SIP/IMS-based voice services in a commercially acceptable manner,
some sessions could have some media types delivered via IP/IMS
simultaneously with voice media delivered via the circuit switched domain
to the same mobile device. To achieve this, the mobile device needs to be
simultaneously attached via both the IP/SIP/IMS domain and the circuit
switched domain.</t>

               <t>To meet this need, the 3GPP has specified how to maintain 
session continuity between the IP/SIP/IMS domain and the circuit switched
domain in 3GPP TS 24.237 <xref target="refs.TS-24.237"/>,
and in 3GPP TS 24.292 <xref target="refs.TS-24.292"/> has specified
how to access IMS hosted services via both the IP/SIP/IMS domain and the
circuit switched domain.</t>

              <t> In order for the mobile device to access SIP/IMS services
via the circuit switched domain, the 3GPP has specified a Mobile Switching
Center (MSC) server enhanced for IMS Centralized Services (ICS) and a MSC
server enhanced for Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (SR-VCC) that control
mobile voice call setup over the circuit switched radio access while
establishing the corresponding voice session in the core network using 
SIP/IMS. To enable this, the MSC server enhanced for ICS or the MSC server
enhanced for SR-VCC performs SIP registration on behalf of the mobile
device, which is also simultaneously directly registered with the
IP/SIP/IMS domain. The only mobile device identifier that is transportable 
using GSM/UMTS/LTE signaling is the IMEI; therefore, the instance-id
included by the MSC server enhanced for ICS or the MSC server enhanced for
SR-VCC when acting on behalf of the mobile device, and the instance-id
directly included by the mobile device, both need to be based on the IMEI.</t> 

              <t>Additionally, in order to meet the above requirements, the
same IMEI that is obtained from the circuit switched signaling by the MSC
server needs to be obtainable from SIP signaling so that it can be
determined that both the SIP signaling and circuit switched signaling
originate from the same mobile device.</t>

              <t>For these reasons, 3GPP TS 24.237
<xref target="refs.TS-24.237"/> and 3GPP TS 24.292
<xref target="refs.TS-24.292"/> already specify the use of
the URN namespace for the GSMA IMEI URN as specified in RFC 7254
<xref target="RFC7254"/> as the instance-id used by GSM/UMTS/LTE mobile
devices, the MSC server enhanced for SR-VCC, and the MSC server enhanced
for ICS, for SIP/IMS registrations and emergency-related SIP requests.

            <section title="3GPP Use Cases">
              <t><list style="numbers">
              <t>The mobile device includes its IMEI in the SIP REGISTER
request so that the SIP registrar can perform a check of the Equipment 
Identity Register (EIR) to verify whether this mobile device is allowed to
access the network for non-emergency services or is barred from doing so
(e.g., because the device has been stolen). If the mobile device is not
allowed to access the network for non-emergency services, the SIP registrar
can reject the registration and thus prevent a barred mobile device from
accessing the network for non-emergency services.</t>

              <t>The mobile device includes its IMEI in SIP INVITE requests
used to establish emergency sessions. This is so that the Public Safety
Answering Point (PSAP) can obtain the IMEI of the mobile device for
identification purposes if required by regulations.</t> 

     <t>The IMEI that is included in SIP INVITE requests by the mobile
     device and used to establish emergency sessions is also used in
     cases of unauthenticated emergency sessions to enable the network
     to identify the mobile device.  This is especially important if
     the unauthenticated emergency session is handed over from the
     packet switched domain to the circuit switched domain.  In this
     scenario, the IMEI is the only identifier that is common to both
     domains, so the Emergency Access Transfer Function (EATF) in the
     network, which in such cases coordinates the transfer between
     domains, can use the IMEI to determine that the circuit switched
     call is from the same mobile device that was in the emergency
     session in the packet switched domain.</t>

                <section anchor="UAC" title="User Agent Client Procedures">
            <t>A User Agent Client (UAC) that has an IMEI as specified in
3GPP TS 23.003 <xref target="refs.TS-23.003"/> and that is registering with a
3GPP IMS network MUST include in the "sip.instance" media feature tag the
GSMA IMEI URN according to the syntax specified in RFC 7254
<xref target="RFC7254"/> when performing the registration procedures
specified in RFC 5626 <xref target="RFC5626"/> or RFC 5627
<xref target="RFC5627"/>, or any other procedure requiring the inclusion of
the "sip.instance" media feature tag. The UAC SHOULD NOT include the
optional 'svn' parameter in the GSMA IMEI URN in the "sip.instance" media
feature tag, since the software version can change as a result of upgrades
to the device firmware that would create a new instance-id. Any future
non-zero values of the 'vers' parameter, or the future definition of
additional parameters for the GSMA IMEI URN that are intended to be used as
part of an instance-id, will require that an update be made to this RFC.
The UAC MUST provide character-by-character identical URNs in each
registration according to RFC 5626 <xref target="RFC5626"/>. Hence, any
optional or variable components of the URN (e.g., the 'vers' parameter)
MUST be presented with the same values and in the same order in every
registration as in the first registration.</t>

                  <t>A UAC MUST NOT use the GSMA IMEI URN as an instance-id,
except when registering with a 3GPP IMS network. When a UAC is operating
in IMS mode, it will obtain from the Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC)
(commonly known as the SIM card) the domain of the network with which to
register. This is a carrier's IMS network domain. The UAC will also obtain
the address of the IMS edge proxy to send the REGISTER request containing
the IMEI using information elements in the Attach response when it attempts
to connect to the carrier's packet data network. When registering with a
non-3GPP IMS network, a UAC SHOULD use a UUID as an instance-id as
specified in RFC 5626 <xref target="RFC5626"/>.</t>

                  <t>A UAC MUST NOT include the "sip.instance" media feature
tag containing the GSMA IMEI URN in the Contact header field of
non-REGISTER requests, except when the request is related to an emergency
session. Regulatory requirements can require that the IMEI be provided to the
PSAP. Any future exceptions to this prohibition will require the
publication of an RFC that addresses how privacy is not violated by such
usage.</t>

                <section anchor="UAS" title="User Agent Server Procedures">
                  <t>A User Agent Server (UAS) MUST NOT include its
"sip.instance" media feature tag containing the GSMA IMEI URN in the
Contact header field of responses, except when the response is related

               <section anchor="SIP_Registrar" title="3GPP SIP Registrar Procedures">
                <t>In 3GPP IMS, when the SIP registrar receives in the
Contact header field a "sip.instance" media feature tag containing the
GSMA IMEI URN according to the syntax specified in RFC 7254
<xref target="RFC7254"/> the SIP registrar follows the procedures specified
in RFC 5626 <xref target="RFC5626"/>. The IMEI URN MAY be validated as
described in RFC 7254 <xref target="RFC7254"/>. If the UA indicates that it
supports the extension in RFC 5627 <xref target="RFC5627"/> and the
SIP registrar allocates a public GRUU according to the procedures specified in 
RFC 5627 <xref target="RFC5627"/>, the instance-id MUST be obfuscated when
creating the 'gr' parameter in order not to reveal the IMEI to other UAs
when the public GRUU is included in non-REGISTER requests and responses.
3GPP TS 24.229 <xref target="refs.TS-24.229"/> subclause 5.4.7A.2 specifies
the mechanism for obfuscating the IMEI when creating the 'gr' parameter.</t> 
               </section>

               <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
                     <t>Because IMEIs, like other formats of instance-ids,
can be correlated to a user, they are personally identifiable information
and therefore MUST be treated in the same way as any other personally
identifiable information. In particular, the "sip.instance" media feature
tag containing the GSMA IMEI URN MUST NOT be included in requests or
responses intended to convey any level of anonymity, as this could violate
the user's privacy. RFC 5626 <xref target="RFC5626"/> states that
"One case where a UA could prefer to omit the "sip.instance" media feature
tag is when it is making an anonymous request or some other privacy concern
requires that the UA not reveal its identity". The same concerns apply
when using the GSMA IMEI URN as an instance-id. Publication of the GSMA
IMEI URN to networks to which the UA is not attached, or with which the
UA does not have a service relationship, is a security breach, and
the "sip.instance" media feature tag MUST NOT be forwarded by the
service provider's network elements when forwarding requests or responses
towards the destination UA. Additionally, an instance-id containing the
GSMA IMEI URN identifies a mobile device and not a user. The instance-id
containing the GSMA IMEI URN MUST NOT be used alone as an address for a
user or as an identification credential for a user. The GRUU mechanism
specified in RFC 5627 <xref target="RFC5627"/> provides a means to create
URIs that address the user at a specific device or User Agent.</t> 

                 <t>Entities that log the instance-id need to protect them as
personally identifiable information. Regulatory requirements can require
that carriers log SIP IMEIs. </t>

                 <t>In order to protect the "sip.instance" media feature tag
containing the GSMA IMEI URN from being tampered with, those REGISTER
requests containing the GSMA IMEI URN MUST be sent using a security
mechanism such as Transport Layer Security (TLS)
(RFC 5246 <xref target="RFC5246"/>) or another security mechanism that
provides equivalent levels of protection such as hop-by-hop security based
upon IPsec.</t>
