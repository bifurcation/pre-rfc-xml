    <abstract>
      <t>As the Internet and the telephone network have become increasingly 
      interconnected and interdependent, attackers can impersonate or obscure 
      calling party numbers when orchestrating bulk commercial calling
      schemes, hacking voicemail boxes, or even circumventing multi-factor 
      authentication systems trusted by banks. This document analyzes threats 
      in the resulting system, enumerating actors, reviewing the capabilities 
      available to and used by attackers, and describing scenarios in which 
      attacks are launched.</t>

    <section title="Introduction and Scope">

<t>As is discussed in the STIR problem statement <xref target="RFC7340"/>
   (where "STIR" refers to the Secure Telephone Identity Revisited
   working group), the primary enabler
   of robocalling, vishing, swatting, and related attacks is the capability to
   impersonate a calling party number.  The starkest examples of these
   attacks are cases where automated callees on the Public Switched Telephone
   Network (PSTN) rely on the
   calling number as a security measure, for example, to access a
   voicemail system.  Robocallers use impersonation as a means of
   obscuring identity. While robocallers can, in the ordinary PSTN,
   block (that is, withhold) their calling number from presentation, callees are less
   likely to pick up calls from blocked identities; therefore, appearing to
   call from some number, any number, is preferable.  However, robocallers
   prefer not to call from a number that can trace back to the
   them, so they impersonate numbers that are not
   assigned to them.
</t>
	
<t>The scope of impersonation in this threat model pertains solely to
   the rendering of a calling telephone number to a callee (human user or
   automaton) at the time of call setup.  The primary attack vector is
   therefore one where the attacker contrives for the calling telephone
   number in signaling to be a chosen number. In this attack, the number is one that the
   attacker is not authorized to use (as a caller) but gives in order for that 
   number to be consumed or rendered on the terminating side.  The threat model
   assumes that this attack simply cannot be prevented: there is no way
   to stop the attacker from creating call setup messages that contain attacker-chosen
   calling telephone numbers.  The solution space therefore focuses on ways that terminating or intermediary elements
   might differentiate authorized from unauthorized calling party
   numbers in order that policies, human or automatic, might act on
   that information.

</t>

<t>Securing an authenticated calling party number at call setup
   time does not entail any assertions about the entity or entities that will
   send and receive media during the call itself.  In call paths with
   intermediaries and gateways (as described below), there may be no way
   to provide any assurance in the signaling about participants in the
   media of a call.  In those end-to-end IP environments where such assurance
   is possible, it is highly desirable. However, in the threat model
   described in this document, "impersonation" does not
   consider impersonating an authorized listener after a call has been
   established (e.g., as a third party attempting to eavesdrop on a
   conversation).  Attackers that could impersonate an authorized listener
   require capabilities that robocallers and voicemail hackers are unlikely to
   possess, and historically, such attacks have not played a role in
   enabling robocalling or related problems.
</t>

<t>In SIP, and even many traditional telephone protocols, call signaling can be renegotiated after the
   call has been established. Using various transfer mechanisms
   common in telephone systems, a callee can easily be connected to, or
   conferenced in with, telephone numbers other than the original
   calling number once a call has been established.  These post-setup changes
   to the call are outside the scope of impersonation considered in this
   model: the motivating use cases of defeating robocalling, voicemail hacking, and swatting all rely on
   impersonation during the initial call setup.
   
   Furthermore, this threat model does not include in its scope the verification
   of the reached party's telephone number back to the originator of the call. There is no assurance to
   the originator that they are reaching the correct number, nor any indication when call forwarding has taken place.
   This threat model is focused only on verifying the calling party number to the callee.
</t>

<t> In much of the PSTN, there exists a supplemental service that
   translates calling party numbers into names, including the
   proper names of people and businesses, for rendering to the called
   user.  These services (frequently marketed as part of 'Caller ID') provide a
   further attack surface for impersonation.  The threat model described
   in this document addresses only the calling party number, even though
   presenting a forged calling party number may cause a
   chosen calling party name to be rendered to the user as well.
   Providing a verifiable calling party number therefore improves
   the security of calling party name systems, but this threat model does not
   consider attacks specific to names. Such attacks may be carried out against the
   databases consulted by the terminating side of a call to provide
   calling party names or by impersonators forging a particular calling
   party number in order to present a misleading name to the user.
</t>
	
	</section>

	<section anchor="actors" title="Actors">
	
	<section anchor="endpoints" title="Endpoints">
	
<t> There are two main categories of end-user terminals relevant to this
discussion, a dumb device (such as a 'black phone') or a smart device:

<list style="symbols">
  <t> Dumb devices comprise a simple dial pad, handset, and ringer,
      optionally accompanied by a display that can render a limited
      number of characters. Typically, the display renders enough characters for a telephone number and
      an accompanying name, but sometimes fewer are rendered.  Although users interface with these
      devices, the intelligence that drives them lives in the service provider network.
</t>

<t>   Smart devices are general-purpose computers with some degree of
      programmability and with the capacity to access the Internet and to render text, audio, and/or images.  
      This category includes smart phones, telephone applications on desktop and laptop computers, IP private branch
      exchanges, etc.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>There is a further category of automated terminals without an end
   user.  These include systems like voicemail services, which may 
   provide a different set of services to a caller based solely on 
   the calling party's number, for example, granting the (purported) 
   mailbox owner access to a menu while giving other callers only the
   ability to leave a message.  Though the
   capability of voicemail services varies widely, many today have
   Internet access and advanced application interfaces (to render
   'visual voicemail' <xref target="OMTP-VV"/>, to automatically transcribe voicemail to email,
   etc.).
</t>
</section> 
	
	
	<section anchor="intermed" title="Intermediaries">

	<t>  The endpoints of a traditional telephone call connect through numerous intermediary devices in the network. The set of intermediary devices traversed during call setup between two endpoints is referred to as a call path.
   The length of the call path can vary considerably: it is possible in
   Voice over IP (VoIP) deployments for two endpoint entities to send traffic to one
   another directly, but, more commonly, several intermediaries exist in a
   VoIP call path.  One or more gateways also may appear on a call path.
<list style="symbols">
	
	<t>      Intermediaries forward call signaling to the next device in the
      path.  These intermediaries may also modify the signaling in order
      to improve interoperability, to enable proper network-layer media
      connections, or to enforce operator policy.  This threat model
      assumes there are no restrictions on the modifications to
      signaling that an intermediary can introduce (which is consistent with the observed behavior of such devices).
</t>
	
	<t>    A gateway is a subtype of intermediary that translates call signaling from one protocol into another.
      In the process, they tend to consume any signaling specific to the
      original protocol (elements like transaction-matching identifiers)
      and may need to transcode or otherwise alter identifiers as they
      are rendered in the destination protocol.
</t></list></t>
 
	<t>   This threat model assumes that intermediaries and gateways can
   forward and retarget calls as necessary, which can result in a call
   terminating at a place the originator did not expect; this
   is a common condition in call routing.  This observation is significant to the
   solution space because it limits the ability of the
   originator to anticipate what the telephone number of the respondent 
   will be (for more on the "unanticipated respondent" problem, see <xref target="SIP-SECURITY"/>).
</t>

	<t>   Furthermore, we assume that some intermediaries or gateways may, due
   to their capabilities or policies, discard calling party number
   information in whole or in part.  Today, many IP-PSTN gateways
   simply ignore any information available about the caller in the IP
   leg of the call and allow the telephone number of the
   Primary Rate Interface (PRI) line used by 
   the gateway to be sent as the calling party number for
   the PSTN leg of the call. For example, a call might also gateway to a
   multi-frequency network where only a limited number of digits of
   automatic numbering identification (ANI) data are signaled.  Some protocols may render telephone numbers in a way that
   makes it impossible for a terminating side to parse or canonicalize a
   number.  In these cases, providing authenticated calling number data may be
   impossible, but this is not indicative of an attack or other
   security failure.
</t>

	</section> 
	
	<section anchor="attackers" title="Attackers">
	
	<t>We assume that an attacker has the following capabilities:</t>
	<t><list style="symbols">
	
	<t>An attacker can create telephone calls at will, originating them
	either on the PSTN or over IP, and can supply an arbitrary calling
	party number.
	</t>
	
	<t>An attacker can capture and replay signaling previously observed by it.
	</t>
	
	<t>An attacker has access to the Internet and thus the ability to
	inject arbitrary traffic over the Internet, to access public
	directories, etc.
	</t>
</list>
</t>
	
	<t>   There are attack scenarios in which an attacker compromises
   intermediaries in the call path or captures credentials that allow
   the attacker to impersonate a caller.  Those system-level attacks are
   not considered in this threat model, though secure design and operation of systems
   to prevent these sorts of attacks are necessary for envisioned
   countermeasures to work. To date, robocallers and other impersonators do not resort
   to compromising systems but rather exploit the intrinsic lack of secure identity in
   existing mechanisms; remedying this problem lies within the scope of this threat 
   model.
</t>
	
	<t>   This threat model also does not consider scenarios in which the
   operators of intermediaries or gateways are themselves adversaries
   who intentionally discard valid identity information (without a user requesting anonymity) 
   or who send falsified identity; see <xref target="solution"/>. 
</t>

	</section>
	</section> 
	
	<section anchor="attacks" title="Attacks">
	
	<t>
	The uses of impersonation described in this section are broadly 
	divided into two categories: those where an attack will not succeed 
	unless the attacker impersonates a specific identity and those 
	where an attacker impersonates an arbitrary identity in order to 
	disguise its own. At a high level, impersonation encourages targets 
	to answer attackers' calls and makes identifying attackers more 
	difficult. This section shows how concrete attacks based on those 
	different techniques might be launched. 
	
	</t>
	
	<section anchor="voicemail" title="Voicemail Hacking via Impersonation">
	
	
	<t>   A voicemail service may allow users calling from their phones
   access to their voicemail boxes on the basis of the calling party
   number.  If an attacker wants to access the voicemail of a particular
   target, the attacker may try to impersonate the calling party number
   using one of the scenarios described in <xref target="scenarios"/>.
</t>

       <t>This attack is closely related to attacks on similar automated systems,
	potentially including banks, airlines, calling-card services, conferencing providers, ISPs, and other
	businesses that fully or partly grant access to resources on the basis of the calling party number alone
	(rather than any shared secret or further identity check). It is analogous to an attack 
	in which a human is encouraged to answer a phone or to divulge information
	once a call is in progress, by seeing a familiar calling party number.
</t>	
	<t> The envisioned countermeasures for this attack involve the voicemail system
   treating calls that supply authenticated calling number data differently
   from other calls. In the
   absence of that identity information, for example, a voicemail service might
   enforce some other caller authentication policy (perhaps requiring a PIN
   for caller authentication). Asserted caller identity alone provides an
   authenticated basis for granting access to a voicemail box only when an identity is claimed legitimately;
   the absence of a verifiably legitimate calling identity here may not be evidence of malice,
   just of uncertainty or a limitation imposed by the set of intermediaries traversed for a specific call path.
</t>

	<t>   If the voicemail service could learn ahead of time that it should
   expect authenticated calling number data from a particular number, that
   would enable the voicemail service to adopt stricter policies for
   handling a request without authentication data.  Since users typically
   contact a voicemail service repeatedly, the service could, for example, remember which
   requests contain authenticated calling number data and require further 
   authentication mechanisms when identity is absent. 
   The deployment of such a feature would be facilitated in many environments 
   by the fact that the voicemail service is often
   operated by an organization that would be in a position to enable or
   require authentication of calling party identity (for example, carriers
   or enterprises).
   Even if the voicemail service is decoupled from the number assignee, 
   issuers of credentials or other authorities could provide a service
   that informs verifiers that they should expect identity in calls from
   particular numbers.
</t>

	
	</section> 
	
	<section 
	    anchor="robocalling" 
	    title="Unsolicited Commercial Calling from Impersonated Numbers">
	
	<t>   The unsolicited commercial calling, or 'robocalling' for short, attack
   is similar to the voicemail attack except that the
   robocaller does not need to impersonate the particular number controlled by the target, merely some
   "plausible" number.  A robocaller may impersonate a number that is not
   an assignable number (for example, in the United States, a number beginning
   with 0) or an unassigned number. This behavior is seen in the wild today. A robocaller may change numbers
   every time a new call is placed, e.g., selecting numbers randomly.
</t>
	
	<t>A closely related attack is sending unsolicited bulk commercial messages via text messaging
	services. These messages usually originate on the Internet, though they may ultimately
	reach endpoints over traditional telephone network protocols or the Internet. While most text
	messaging endpoints are mobile phones,  broadband residential services
	are increasingly supporting text
	messaging as well. The originators of these messages typically
	impersonate a calling party number, in some
	cases, a "short code" specific to text messaging services. 
	</t>
	
	<t>The envisioned countermeasures to robocalling are similar to those in the voicemail
   example, but there are significant differences.  One important
   potential countermeasure is simply to verify that the calling party
   number is in fact assignable and assigned.  Unlike voicemail services, end
   users typically have never been contacted by the number used by a
   robocaller before. Thus, they can't rely on past association to anticipate
   whether or not the calling party number should supply
   authenticated calling number data.  If there were a service that could inform
   the terminating side that it should expect this data for calls 
   or texts from that number, however, that would also help in the
   robocalling case.
</t>
	
	<t>
   When a human callee is to be alerted at call setup time, the time frame for executing any
   countermeasures is necessarily limited.  Ideally, a user would not be
   alerted that a call has been received until any necessary identity
   checks have been performed.  This could, however, result in inordinate
   post-dial delay from the perspective of legitimate callers.
   Cryptographic and network operations must be minimized for
   these countermeasures to be practical. For text messages, a delay for executing
   anti-impersonation countermeasures is much less likely to degrade perceptible service.
</t>
	
	<t>   The eventual effect of these countermeasures would be to force
   robocallers to either (a) block their caller identity, in which case end
   users could opt not to receive such calls or messages, or (b) use
   authenticated calling numbers traceable to them, which would then allow for
   other forms of redress.
</t>
	
	</section> 
	
	<section anchor="tdos" title="Telephony Denial-of-Service Attacks">
	
	<t>
	
	In the case of telephony denial-of-service (TDoS) attacks, the attack relies on impersonation in order
	to obscure the origin of an attack that is intended to tie up telephone resources. By placing
	incessant telephone calls, an attacker renders a target number
	unreachable by legitimate callers. These attacks might target a business, an individual,
	or a public resource like emergency responders; the attacker may intend to extort the target. Attack calls may be
	placed from a single endpoint or from multiple endpoints under the control of the attacker, and the attacker may 
	control endpoints in different administrative domains.
	Impersonation, in this case, allows the attack to evade policies that would block
	based on the originating number and furthermore prevents the victim from learning the perpetrator of the attack
	or even the originating service provider of the attacker.
	
	</t><t>

	As is the case with robocalling, the attacker typically does not have
	to impersonate a specific number in order to launch a denial-of-service attack. 
	The number simply has to vary enough to prevent simple policies from blocking 
	the attack calls. An attacker may, however, have a further intention to
	create the appearance that a particular party is to blame for an
	attack; in that case, the attacker might want to impersonate a secondary target in the attack. 
	
	</t><t>
	
	The envisioned countermeasures are twofold. First, as with robocalling, ensuring that calling party numbers are
	assignable or assigned will help mitigate unsophisticated attacks.
	Second, if authenticated calling number data is supplied for legitimate calls, then Internet endpoints or intermediaries can make effective policy decisions
	in the middle of an attack by deprioritizing unsigned calls when congestion conditions exist; signed calls, if accepted, have the necessary accountability 
	should it turn out they are malicious. This could extend to include, for example, an originating network observing a congestion condition for
	a destination number and perhaps dropping unsigned calls that are clearly part of a TDoS attack. As with robocalling, all of these countermeasures must execute in a timely manner to be effective.
	
	</t><t>
	
	There are certain flavors of TDoS attacks, including those against
	emergency responders, against which authenticated calling number data
	is unlikely
	to be a successful countermeasure. These entities are effectively obligated to attempt to respond to every call they receive, and the 
	absence of authenticated calling number data in many cases will not remove that obligation.

   attacker's INVITE reaches an Internet-to-PSTN gateway, which inserts
   the attacker's chosen calling party number into the CgPN of an IAM.  That IAM then traverses the PSTN until (perhaps after a call
   forwarding) it reaches another gateway, this time back to the IP
   realm, to an H.323 network.  The PSTN-IP gateway takes the
   calling party number in the IAM CgPN field and puts it into the SETUP
   request.  When the SETUP reaches the endpoint terminal, the terminal
