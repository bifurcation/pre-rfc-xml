This document defines a binding revocation mechanism to terminate a mobile node's mobility session and the associated resources. This mechanism can be used both with base Mobile IPv6 and its extensions, such as Proxy Mobile IPv6. The mechanism allows the mobility entity which initiates the revocation procedure to request its peer to terminate either one, multiple or all specified Binding Cache entries.

<section anchor="introduction "title="Introduction">
<t>
In the case of Mobile IPv6 and for administrative reasons, sometimes it becomes necessary to inform the mobile node that its registration has been revoked and the mobile node is no longer able to receive IP mobility service for its Home Address. A similar Mobile IPv4 registration revocation mechanism <xref target="RFC3543"/> has been specified by the IETF for providing a revocation mechanism for sessions that were established using Mobile IPv4 registration <xref target="RFC3344"/>.
</t>

<t>
This document specifies a binding revocation mechanism that can be used to revoke a mobile node's mobility session(s). The same mechanism can be used to revoke bindings created using Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC3775"/> or any of its extensions, e.g., Proxy Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC5213"/>. The proposed revocation mechanism uses a new Mobility Header (MH) type 16 for revocation signaling that is applicable to Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC3775"/> and Proxy Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC5213"/> and can be used by any two IP mobility entities. As an example, this mechanism allows a local mobility anchor (LMA), involved in providing IP mobility services to a mobile node, to notify the mobile access gateway (MAG) of the termination of that mobile node binding registration. In another example, a mobile access gateway can use this mechanism to notify its local mobility anchor peer with a bulk termination of all or a subset of proxy mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) bindings that are registered with the local mobility anchor and currently being served by the mobile access gateway. Any mobility entity is allowed to revoke only the registration of those mobile node(s) mobility sessions that are currently registered with it.

<!-- ==-- Binding Revocation Prot. & UseCases Overview - Starts--== -->
<section anchor="ProtandUse" title="Binding Revocation Protocol and Use Cases Overview">

<t>
This specification specifies a generic binding revocation mechanism where a mobility node can communicate to the mobile node or another mobility node the identity of the mobile node registration binding that is being terminated. In the case when this mechanism is used for bulk termination or multiple bindings, the identities of these bindings are communicated to the mobile node or mobility node using the same generic mechanism. The following subsections present the protocol overview and applicable use cases.
</t>

<!-- ====-- Binding Revocation Protocol - Starts--==== -->
<section anchor="ProtOverview" title="Binding Revocation Protocol">
<t>
In the case of Mobile IPv6, if the home network decides to terminate
the service of the mobile node, the home agent sends a Binding
Revocation Indication (BRI) message to the mobile node. The home agent
includes the home address (HoA) of the mobile node in the Type 2
routing header as specified in <xref target="RFC3775"/> to indicate
the impacted mobile node binding. In the case of Dual Stack Mobile
IPv6 (DSMIPv6) <xref target="RFC5555"/>, the home agent may include
the IPv4 Home Address option with the home IPv4 address assigned by
the mobile node. Additionally, if the mobile node registered multiple care-of addresses <xref target="RFC5648"/>, the home agent includes the Binding Identifier (BID) option(s) in the Binding Revocation Indication message to identify which binding is being revoked. When the mobile node receives a Binding Revocation Indication message with its HoA included in the Type 2 routing header, the mobile node responds by sending a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement (BRA) message.
</t>

<t>
Similarly, in the case of Proxy Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC5213"/>, the revocation procedure can be initiated by the local mobility anchor by sending a Binding Revocation Indication message to communicate the termination of a mobile node registration binding to the mobile access gateway. In this case, the local mobility anchor includes the mobile node Home Network Prefix (MN-HNP) option <xref target="RFC5213"/> and the MN-ID option <xref target="RFC4283"/> to indicate to the mobility access gateway the identity of the PMIPv6 binding that needs to be terminated. When the mobile access gateway receives the Binding Revocation Indication message, the mobile access gateway responds to the local mobility anchor by sending a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message.
</t> 

<t>
On the other hand, the mobile access gateway usually sends a de-registration message by sending a Proxy Binding Update with a lifetime of zero to indicate to the local mobility anchor of the termination of the PMIPv6 mobile node binding registration. In this case, the mobile access gateway includes the MN-HNP option, the MN-ID option, and all other required mobility options as per <xref target="RFC5213"/> in order for the local mobility anchor to identify the mobile node PMIPv6 binding. Additionally, in the case when the mobile access gateway communicates a bulk termination of PMIPv6 mobility sessions, the mobile access gateway sends a Binding Revocation Indication message with the Global (G) bit set and includes the mobile access gateway identity in the MN-ID option, see <xref target="MAGsendBRI"/> and <xref target="LMAreceiveBRI"/>. When the local mobility anchor receives such a Binding Revocation Indication message, it ensures that the mobile access gateway is authorized to send such a bulk termination message, see <xref target="SecConsider"/>, and then processes the Binding Revocation Indication message accordingly. If the local mobility anchor processes the Binding Revocation Indication message successfully, the local mobility anchor responds to the mobile access gateway by sending Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message.
</t>

<t>
In any of the above cases, the initiator of the binding revocation procedure, e.g., home agent, local mobility anchor, or mobile access gateway, uses the Revocation Trigger field in the Binding Revocation Indication message to indicate to the receiving node the reason for initiating the revocation procedure.
</t>

<!-- ========-- CMIPv6 Use Cases - Start --======== -->
<section anchor="CMIP6Usecase" title="MIPv6 and DSMIP6 Use Case">
<t>
The binding revocation mechanism is applicable to Mobile IPv6 and DSMIPv6 session(s) when the home agent needs to inform the mobile node that its binding registration has been revoked, e.g., for an administrative reason. This mechanism enables the user or the mobile node to react to the revocation, e.g., reinstate its interrupted Mobile IPv6 services.
</t>

<t>
In this case, the home agent sends a Binding Revocation Indication message to indicate to the mobile node that its current mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) binding has been revoked and it is no longer able to receive IP mobility service. The home agent includes the HoA in a Type 2 routing header as used in <xref target="RFC3775"/> and sets the Revocation Trigger field to a proper value, e.g., Administrative Reason. In the case of a DSMIPv6 session, the home agent may additionally include the mobile-node-assigned IPv4 Home Address in the IPv4 Home Address option. When the mobile node receives the Binding Revocation Indication message, it sends a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message to the home agent. <xref target="fig1"/> illustrates the message sequencing when a home agent revokes a mobile node binding registration.

<section anchor="MCoA" title="Multiple Care-of Addresses (MCoA) Use Case">
<t>
In the case of multiple care-of address registrations <xref target="RFC5648"/>, the home agent maintains a different binding for each care-of address and home address pair. These bindings are also indexed and identified during the mobile node registration using a BID mobility option. The HA may revoke one or multiple bindings for the same mobile node home address.
</t>

<t>
If the home agent revokes a single binding for a mobile node with multiple care-of address registrations, the home agent sends a Binding Revocation Indication message to the mobile node with the corresponding BID option included. If more than one of the mobile node registered care-of addresses needs to be revoked, the home agent includes all the corresponding BID options in the same Binding Revocation Indication message. <xref target="fig2"/> illustrates the message flow when the home agent revokes two registered care-of addresses for the same mobile node in a single Binding Revocation Indication message.

<t>
Additionally, the home agent may revoke all of the mobile node registered bindings by sending a BRI message without including any BID options while the HoA is included in the Type 2 routing header. <xref target="fig1"/> illustrates the message flow when the home agent revokes all registered care-of address bindings for a mobile node in a single Binding Revocation Indication message.

<!-- ========-- Monami6 Use Cases - Ends --======== -->
<!----->
<!-- ========-- PMIPv6 Use Cases - Start --======== -->
<section anchor="PMIP6" title="Proxy MIPv6 Use Case">
<t>
Since the mobile node does not participate in the mobility mechanism in the case of PMIPv6, there are many scenarios where the Binding Revocation mechanism is needed to clean resources and make sure that the mobility entities, i.e., mobile access gateway and local mobility anchor, are always synchronized with respect to the status of the existing PMIPv6 bindings. The binding revocation mechanism is generic enough that it can be used for all Proxy Mobile IPv6 scenarios that follow the <xref target="RFC5213"/> and <xref target="RFC5844"/> specifications.
</t>

<t>
When the mobile access gateway receives a Binding Revocation Indication message as in <xref target="MAGreceiveBRI"/>, the mobile access gateway sends a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message to the local mobility anchor following the rules described in <xref target="SendBRA"/>. Similarly, if the local mobility anchor receives a Binding Revocation Indication message, the local mobility anchor responds to the mobile access gateway by sending a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message.
</t>

<!-- ========-- PMIPv6 LMA Revokes a Binding - Start --======== -->
<section anchor="LMARevoke" title="Local Mobility Anchor Initiates PMIPv6 Revocation">
<t>
The local mobility anchor may send a Binding Revocation Indication message with the appropriate revocation trigger value to the mobile access gateway that hosts a specific PMIPv6 binding to indicate that the mobile node binding has been terminated and the mobile access gateway can clean up the applicable resources. When the mobile access gateway receives a Binding Revocation Indication message, the mobile access gateway identifies the respective binding and it sends a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message to the local mobility anchor. In this case, the mobile access gateway could terminate the IPv6 or IPv4 mobility session on the access link and notify the mobile node as in
<xref target="MAGreceiveBRI"/>.
</t>

<t>
As an example, <xref target="fig3"/>, illustrates the message sequence for revoking a mobile node binding at the source mobile access gateway during the mobile node inter-MAG handover. During the inter-MAG handover, the mobile node moves from the source MAG to the target MAG. The target MAG sends a Proxy Binding Update with the new care-of address to the local mobility anchor to update the mobile node's point of attachment. Since the mobile node binding at the local mobility anchor points to the source MAG and upon receiving the Proxy Binding Update from the target MAG, the local mobility anchor updates the MN Binding Cache entry (BCE) and sends a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement to the target MAG. The local mobility anchor can send a Binding Revocation Indication message with the appropriate revocation trigger value, e.g., inter-MAG handover - different Access Types, to the source MAG in order to clean up the applicable resources reserved for the specified mobile node binding. The source mobile access gateway acknowledges the Binding Revocation Indication message by sending a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message to indicate the success or failure of the termination of the mobile node's binding.
</t>

<t>
The process identified above can also be used by the local mobility anchor in scenarios other than the inter-MAG handover with the proper revocation trigger value to indicate to the peer mobile access gateway that a specific PMIPv6 binding or bindings have been revoked.

<t>
In some deployments, the network between the mobile access gateway and the local mobility anchor may only support IPv4 transport. Another case is when a mobile node that supports client mobile IPv6 roams to an access network where only IPv4 addressing and transport is supported. In this case, the mobile node is required to register an IPv4 home address with its home agent using a mobile IPv6 Binding Update message.
</t>

<t>
If the Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement messages or the Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement messages are sent using UDP encapsulation <xref target="RFC5844"/> <xref target="RFC5555"/>, then the Binding Revocation Messages are sent using the same UDP encapsulation. The same UDP source and destination port numbers and IPv4 addresses used for exchanging the Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement or the Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement messages MUST be used when transporting Binding Revocation Messages over IPv4 using UDP encapsulation.  For example, the source UDP port number, the destination UDP port number, the source IPv4 address, and the destination IPv4 address of the Binding Revocation Indication message are set to the destination UDP port number, the source UDP port number, destination IPv4 address, and source IPv4 address of the latest received and successfully processed Proxy Binding Update or Binding Update message, respectively.

If the Binding Revocation Type field is set to 1, the Binding Revocation Message is a Binding Revocation Indication as in <xref target="BRI"/>. However, if the value is 2, it is a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message as in <xref target="BRA"/>.

The Binding Revocation Message MUST be protected using the same underlying security association, e.g., IPsec, that is being used between the two peers to protect the mobile node's Mobile IPv6 and its extensions binding registration signaling. If IPsec is not used as the underlying security mechanism to protect the binding registration signaling, the used underlying security mechanism MUST provide protection against all identified security threats as described under "Security Considerations" in <xref target="RFC3775"/> and <xref target="RFC5213"/>.

<t>
To terminate a mobile node registration and its current binding with the home agent, the home agent sends a packet to the mobile node containing a Binding Revocation Indication, with the packet constructed as follows:
</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>
The Revocation Trigger field MUST be set to indicate to the mobile node the reason for revoking its IP mobility binding with the home agent. The Revocation Trigger may be used by the mobile node to take further steps if necessary.
</t>

<t>
The Binding Revocation Indication MUST be sent using a Type 2 routing header that contains the mobile node's registered IPv6 home address for the binding being revoked.
</t>

<t>
The care-of address for the binding MUST be used as the destination address in the packet's IPv6 header.
</t>

<t>
If the home agent needs to only revoke the mobile node's IPv4 home address binding, the home agent MUST set the IPv4 HoA Binding Only (V) bit and MUST include the mobile node's registered IPv4 home address that is being revoked in the IPv4 Home Address option.
</t>
</list>

<t>
When the home agent sends a Binding Revocation Indication to the mobile node, the home agent sets a flag in the mobile node BCE to indicate that revocation is in progress and starts the InitMINDelayBRIs timer. The home agent maintains the mobile node BCE in this state until it receives a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement or retransmits the Binding Revocation Indication message as described in <xref target="Retransmit"/>.
</t>

<t>
In a race condition case, the home agent may receive a Binding Update from the mobile node while the mobile node's BCE has the revocation in progress flag set, the home agent SHOULD handle this case based on the reason for sending the Binding Revocation Indication message and its local policy. In this case, if the home agent accepts the Binding Update, it needs to update the mobile node BCE accordingly, e.g., removing the revocation in progress flag.
</t>

<t>
When the home agent needs to revoke one or more of a mobile node bindings that were created using multiple care-of address registrations as in <xref target="RFC5648"/>, the home agent MUST include all the related BID mobility options that identify these bindings in the Binding Revocation Indication message. In the case when the home agent needs to revoke all of the mobile node bindings, the home agent SHOULD NOT include any of the BID mobility options.
</t>

<t>
When the home agent receives a packet carrying a valid Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message, the home agent follows <xref target="ReceiveProcess"/> in processing this message.

<t>
To terminate a mobile node PMIPv6 registration and its current binding with the local mobility anchor, the local mobility anchor sends a packet to the mobile access gateway containing a Binding Revocation Indication message following the procedure in <xref target="SendProcess"/> and the following rules:
</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>
The Proxy Binding (P) bit MUST be set to indicate that the binding being revoked is a PMIPv6 binding.
</t>

<t>
The Revocation Trigger field MUST be set to indicate to the mobile access gateway the reason for removing the specified mobile node PMIPv6 binding at the local mobility anchor. The Revocation Trigger may be used by the mobile access gateway to learn the mobile node's latest movement.
</t>

<t>
The packet MUST contain the Mobile Node Identifier (MN-ID) option, which contains the mobile node's Network Access Identifier (NAI) that was used in the Proxy Binding Update during the mobile node registration.
</t>

<t>
If the Mobile Node Identifier (MN-ID) is registered in more than one of the mobile node's BCEs and the local mobility anchor does NOT need to revoke all of the mobile node's bindings, the Binding Revocation Indication message MUST contain another identifier to uniquely identify the mobile node binding(s) that is being revoked, e.g., at least one Home Network Prefix option that contains the mobile node's registered Home Network Prefix (HNP) for the binding being revoked.
</t>

<t>
In the case of revoking all Per-Peer bindings, the local mobility anchor MUST set the Global (G) bit and the Revocation Trigger MUST contain the value "Per-Peer Policy" to request the mobile access gateway to remove all Per-Peer bindings that are registered with the local mobility anchor and this mobile access gateway.
</t>

<t>
The proxy care-of address for the binding MUST be used as the destination address in the packet's IPv6 header. However, in the case when IPsec is used to protect the Proxy MIPv6 signaling as specified in <xref target="RFC5213"/>, the destination address MUST be set to the mag_address that is being used for keying the IPsec SA. If the mag_address is different than the mobile node proxy care-of address, the Alternate Care-of Address option MUST be included and MUST contain the mobile node proxy care-of address.
</t>

</list>

<t>
The local mobility anchor MAY delete the mobile node(s) IP tunnel immediately after sending the initial Binding Revocation Indication and before receiving the Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message.
</t>

<t>
When the local mobility anchor sends a Binding Revocation Indication to the mobile access gateway to remove a specific binding, the local mobility anchor sets a flag in the mobile node proxy BCE to indicate that revocation is in progress and starts the InitMINDelayBRIs timer. The local mobility anchor SHOULD maintain the mobile node proxy BCE in this state until it receives a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement or the BRIMaxRetransmitNumber is reached. In the case when the local mobility anchor sets the Revocation Trigger field to a value that indicates inter-MAG handover, the local mobility anchor MAY switch the mobile node IP tunnel to the target mobile access gateway before sending the Binding Revocation Indication to the source mobile access gateway.
</t>

<t>
In a race condition case, the local mobility anchor may receive a Proxy Binding Update from the mobile access gateway while the mobile node's proxy BCE has the revocation in progress flag set. The local mobility anchor should handle this case based on the reason for sending the Binding Revocation Indication message and its local policy. In this case, if the local mobility anchor accepts the Proxy Binding Update, it needs to update the mobile node proxy BCE accordingly, e.g., removing the revocation in progress flag.
</t>

<t>
When the local mobility anchor needs to revoke all the mobile node proxy BCEs that are registered with the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway peer, it MUST set the Global (G) bit and set the value of the Revocation Trigger field to "Per-Peer Policy". In this case, the local mobility anchor MUST NOT include any mobility options in this Binding Revocation Indication message.
</t>

<t>
When the local mobility anchor needs to revoke all mobile nodes proxy BCEs that belong to a specific realm and are registered with the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway peer, the local mobility anchor MUST set the Global (G) bit and set the value of the Revocation Trigger field to "Revoking Mobility Node Local Policy". In this case, the local mobility anchor MUST include a mobility option in the Binding Revocation Indication that is shared among all the impacted mobile nodes BCEs, e.g., the mobile node identifier option, MN-ID option, with a subtype value of 1. In this case, the NAI value in the MN-ID MUST follow the format where the content after the "@" character defines the realm that is shared amongst all of the impacted mobile nodes proxy BCEs. As an example: @example.com identifies all mobile nodes whose MN-ID value contains "example.com" as the realm, e.g., "1234abdelta@example.com", "axxxyzd@example.com", and "abcdefg.xyz123@example.com", but not "1234abdelta@foo.example.com".
</t>

<t>
When the local mobility anchor needs to revoke a subgroup of the mobile nodes proxy BCEs that belong to a specific realm and are registered with the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway, the local mobility anchor MUST set the Global (G) bit and set the value of the Revocation Trigger field to "Revoking Mobility Node Local Policy". In this case, the local mobility anchor MUST include an additional mobility option to the mobile node identifier option (MN-ID) option, with a subtype value of 1. In other words, the impacted mobile node BCEs are those that have an MN-ID with a realm as specified above and, e.g., are assigned the same proxy care-of address as the one included in the Alternate Care-of Address mobility option.
</t>

<t>
When the mobile node is registered with multiple Home Network Prefixes for the same proxy care-of address, the local mobility anchor SHOULD include an HNP option for each registered HNP in the Binding Revocation Indication. Alternatively, it MAY include only the mobile node identifier (MN-ID) option with the mobile node NAI included to indicate to the mobile access gateway to remove all bindings of the specified mobile node NAI in the MN-ID option.
</t>

<t>
According to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification <xref target="RFC5213"/>, if the local mobility anchor receives a Proxy Binding Update message from a new mobile access gateway for extending the binding lifetime of the only BCE of this mobile node with the Handoff Indicator value set to "Handoff state unknown (4)", the local mobility anchor waits a period of MaxDelayBeforeNewBCEAssign to receive a de-registration message from the previous mobile access gateway before updating the mobile node's BCE with the new point of attachment. If a de-registration message is not received, the local mobility anchor considers the received Proxy Binding Update message as a request for a new BCE and if processed successfully, the local mobility anchor assigns a different HNP for the new BCE.
</t>

<t>
This document updates the local mobility anchor's behavior in this case. If the local mobility anchor supports the binding revocation mechanism as described in this document, it SHOULD proactively send a Binding Revocation Indication message to the previous mobile access gateway instead of waiting for a de-registration from the previous mobile access gateway. In the Binding Revocation Indication message, the Revocation Trigger MUST be set to "Inter-MAG Handover - Unknown".
</t>

<t>
  If the local mobility anchor sent a Binding Revocation Indication
  message with the Revocation Trigger field set to "Inter-MAG Handover
  - Unknown" and while waiting for a response, Binding Revocation
  Acknowledgement, the following are possible conditions that the local
  mobility anchor MUST handle as specified below:

</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>
If the local mobility anchor receives a successful Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message or a de-registration message from the previous mobile access gateway, the local mobility anchor MUST update the mobile node BCE as if it received a de-registration message as described in <xref target="RFC5213"/>.
</t>

<t>
If the local mobility anchor receives a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message with the Status field set to "Revocation Failed - MN is Attached", the local mobility anchor SHOULD update the mobile node BCE as if it did NOT receive a de-registration before the MaxDelayBeforeNewBCEAssign timer expired by creating a new BCE as described in <xref target="RFC5213"/>.
</t>

<t>
If the local mobility anchor did not receive a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message or a de-registration Proxy Binding Update from the previous mobile access gateway after it exhausted all of the Binding Revocation Indication message retransmissions as described in <xref target="Retransmit"/>, the local mobility anchor SHOULD update the mobile node's BCE as if it did NOT receive a de-registration before the MaxDelayBeforeNewBCEAssign timer expired by creating a new BCE as described in <xref target="RFC5213"/>. Note that the local mobility anchor SHOULD use the recommended number of retransmissions for the Binding Revocation Indication message as described in <xref target="Config"/> to avoid delaying the creation of a new Binding Cache entry for too long, if the mobile node is actually attaching to the new MAG with a different interface.
</t>

</list>

<t>
When the mobile node is registered with an IPv4 proxy home address in addition to the Home Network Prefix where both of the IPv4 proxy HoA (pHoA) and HNP are bound to the same proxy CoA (pCoA), the local mobility anchor MAY revoke the mobile node IPv4 proxy HoA binding to the current mobile node proxy CoA while maintaining the mobile node binding of the HNP to its current pCoA as part of the mobile node BCE. In this case, if the local mobility anchor decides to revoke the mobile node IPv4 proxy HoA only, it MUST send a Binding Revocation Indication message following the procedure in <xref target="SendProcess"/> and the following rules:
</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>
The IPv4 HoA Binding Only (V) bit MUST be set in the BRI to indicate that only the IPv4 home address binding is being revoked.

<t>
The IPv4 Home Address Request option MUST be included with the mobile node's registered proxy home IPv4 address that is being released in addition to the MN-ID option.
</t>

<t>
The mobile node Home Network Prefix option MUST NOT be included.

If the Global (G) bit is set and the Revocation Trigger value is "Per-Peer Policy", and only the mobile node identifier (MN-ID) option is included, the local mobility anchor MUST revoke all mobile node bindings for which the proxy CoA is the one used as the source of the IPv6 packet that carried the Binding Revocation Indication. However, if the Alternate Care-of Address option is included in addition to the mobile node identifier option, the local mobility anchor MUST revoke all mobile node bindings whose proxy care-of address matches the care-of address in the Alternate Care-of Address option.

In this case, the mobile access gateway MUST reject the Binding Revocation Indication message using status code "Revoked Mobile Nodes Identity Required".
</t>

<t>
If the Revocation Trigger field value in the received Binding Revocation Indication message indicates inter-MAG handover, e.g., Inter-MAG Handover - Unknown, the mobile access gateway uses the mobility option(s) included in the Binding Revocation Indication message to identify the mobile node binding. The mobile access gateway SHOULD ensure that the mobile node is no longer attached to the mobile access gateway before accepting the BRI message using status code "success". However, if the mobile access gateway verified that the mobile node is still directly attached, the mobile access gateway MUST reject the BRI using status code "Revocation failed - MN is Attached".

If the IPv4 HoA Binding Only (V) bit is set, the mobile access gateway uses the MN-ID option to identify the mobile node binding entry in the Binding Update List (BUL). The mobile access gateway MUST verify that the IPv4 address included in the IPv4 Home Address Request option in the received Binding Revocation Indication is the same as the IPv4 proxy HoA that is assigned to the mobile node. After the mobile access gateway successfully validates the received IPv4 home address as the mobile node IPv4 HoA, it MUST consider this as an indication to ONLY release the mobile node IPv4 proxy HoA binding to the mobile node current proxy CoA. Consequently, it MUST continue to maintain the mobile node IPv6 proxy HoA or HNP binding to the current mobile node proxy CoA as part of the mobile node binding in the BUL entry and release all resources associated with the MN IPv4 proxy HoA binding to the MN pCoA. If the mobile access gateway processed the BRI successfully, the mobile access gateway MUST accept the BRI using status code "success".

If the mobile node has registered multiple care-of addresses with its home agent, the mobile node MUST verify which binding is being revoked by examining the content of the Binding Revocation Indication message. If the mobile node received a Binding Revocation Indication with one or more BID options and its home address is included in the Type 2 routing header, the mobile node MUST consider all of the care-of addresses bindings, identified in the BID options, with this home address as being revoked.

<!-- [rfced] Acknowledgement vs. Acknowledgment
We note that the IANA registry lists it without "e",
but this document uses it consistently with "e".
Would you like to update the document to match the registry, 
or vice versa (i.e., request that IANA update the registry)?

We note that Acknowledgement (with "e") was generally used 
in the I-Ds that became this cluster (RFCs-to-be 5844-5847).

<section anchor="SecConsider" title="Security Considerations">
<t>
This specification allows the mobility node that initiates the binding revocation procedure to revoke a mobility session(s) that is currently registered with it. It is NOT allowed for any mobility node to revoke a mobile node mobility session that is not registered with this mobility node.
</t>

<t>
The binding revocation protocol described in this specification uses the same security association between the mobile node and the home agent or the mobile access gateway and the local mobility anchor that is being used to exchange the MIPv6 or PMIPv6 Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement signaling. If IPsec is used, the traffic selectors associated with the Security Policy Database (SPD) entry protecting the Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement MUST be extended to include Binding Revocation Message MH type 16. Extending the traffic selectors of the SPD entry in order to reuse the SA protecting the Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement (instead of creating new ones) ensures that those SAs will be up and running when the revoking entity needs to send a binding revocation signaling message.
</t>

<t>
On the other hand, if IPsec is not used as the underlying security mechanism to protect the Mobile IPv6 and its extensions binding registration signaling, the used underlying security mechanism MUST provide protection against all identified security threats as described under "Security Considerations" in <xref target="RFC3775"/> and <xref target="RFC5213"/>.
</t>

<t>
Since some mobility entities, e.g., local mobility anchor and mobile access gateway, are allowed to send and receive Binding Revocation Indications and Binding Revocation Acknowledgements for different cases, when IPsec is used to secure signaling between the local mobility anchor and mobile access gateway, it prevents any of them from processing a Binding Revocation Message that was not constructed by an authorized party.
</t>

<t>
The Proxy Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC5213"/> requires the local mobility anchor to restrict the creation and manipulation of proxy bindings to specifically authorized mobile access gateways. Therefore, the mobile access gateway that is authorized to create or manipulate the mobile node proxy BCE is also authorized to revoke such mobile node registration by sending a de-registration with lifetime of zero. However, since bulk termination using Binding Revocation Indication with the Global (G) bit set and the Revocation Trigger field set to "Per-Peer Policy" impacts all mobility sessions that are registered with the mobile access gateway and its local mobility anchor peer, the local mobility anchor MUST be locally configurable to authorize such specific functionality. Additional mechanisms, such as a policy store or Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) may be employed, but these are outside the scope of this specification.
