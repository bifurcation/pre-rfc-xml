    <abstract>
      <t>The Port Control Protocol (PCP) anycast addresses enable PCP clients to
      transmit signaling messages to their closest PCP-aware on-path NAT, firewall, or other
      middlebox without having to learn the IP address of that middlebox via
      some external channel.  This document establishes one well-known
      IPv4 address and one well-known IPv6 address to be used as
      PCP anycast addresses.</t>

    <section anchor="sec.intro" title="Introduction">

      <t>The Port Control Protocol (PCP) <xref target="RFC6887"/> 
      provides a mechanism to control how
      incoming packets are forwarded by upstream devices such as Network
      Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers
      (NAT64), Network Address Translation from
      IPv4 to IPv4 (NAT44), and IPv6 and IPv4 firewall devices. Furthermore, it
      provides a mechanism to
      reduce application keepalive traffic
      <xref target="PCP-OPTIMIZE"/>.
      The PCP base protocol document <xref target="RFC6887"/> 
      specifies the message formats used, but the address to which a client
      sends its request is either assumed to be the default router (which is
      appropriate in a typical single-link residential network) or has to be
      configured otherwise via some external mechanism, such as a configuration
      file or a DHCP option <xref target="RFC7291"/>.
      </t>

      <t>This document follows a different approach: it establishes two
      well-known anycast addresses for the PCP server, one IPv4 address
      and one IPv6 address.  PCP clients usually send PCP requests to these
      well-known addresses if no other PCP server addresses are known or after
      communication attempts to such other addresses have failed.
      The anycast addresses are allocated from pools of special-purpose
      IP addresses (see <xref target="sec.ianacons"/>), in accordance 
      with Section 3.4 of <xref target="RFC4085"/>. Yet, a means to
      disable or
      override these well-known addresses (e.g., a configuration file option)
      should be available in implementations.
      </t>

      <t>Using an anycast address is particularly useful in larger network
      topologies. For example, if the PCP-enabled NAT/firewall function is
      not located on the client's default gateway but further upstream in a
      Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN), sending PCP requests to the default gateway's
      IP address will not have the desired effect.
      When using a configuration file or the DHCP option to learn the PCP
      server's IP address, this file or the DHCP server configuration must
      reflect the network topology and the router and CGN configuration.
      This may be cumbersome to achieve and maintain.
      If there is more than one upstream CGN and traffic is routed using a
      dynamic routing protocol such as OSPF, this approach may not be
      feasible at all, as it cannot provide timely information regarding which CGN to
      interact with.
      In contrast, when using the PCP anycast address, the PCP request will
      travel through the network like any other packet (i.e., without any special
      support from DNS, DHCP, other routers, or anything else) until it
      reaches the PCP-capable device that receives it, handles it, and
      sends back a reply.

      A further advantage of using an anycast address instead of a DHCP
      option is that the anycast address can be hard-coded into the
      application. There is no need for an application
      programming interface that passes the PCP server's address from the
      operating system's DHCP client to the application.  For further discussion of deployment
      considerations, see <xref target="sec.depl.cons"/>.

    <section anchor="sec.spec"
             title="PCP Server Discovery Based on Well-Known IP Address">
      <section title="PCP Discovery Client Behavior">


        <t>PCP clients can add the PCP anycast addresses, 
        which are defined in Sections 
        <xref target="sec.ianareg4" format="counter"/>
        and <xref target="sec.ianareg6" format="counter"/>, after
        the default router list (for IPv4 and IPv6)
        to the list of PCP server(s)  
        (see step 2 in Section 8.1 of <xref target="RFC6887"/>).
        This list is processed as specified in
        <xref target="RFC7488"/>.</t>

        <t>Note:
        If, in some specific
		scenario, it was desirable to use only the anycast address
		(and not the default router), this could be achieved by putting
		the anycast address into the configuration file or DHCP option.
		</t>
        
      </section>

      <section title="PCP Discovery Server Behavior">
        <t>PCP servers can be configured to listen on the anycast addresses for
        incoming PCP requests. When a PCP server receives a PCP request
        destined for an anycast address it supports, it sends the corresponding PCP
        replies using that same anycast address as the source address (see
        the "How UDP and TCP Use Anycasting" section of <xref target="RFC1546"/>
	for further discussion).</t> 
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec.depl.cons" title="Deployment Considerations">

        <t>For general recommendations regarding operation of
        anycast services, see <xref target="RFC4786"/>. 
        Architectural considerations of IP anycast are discussed in 
        <xref target="RFC7094"/>.</t>

        <t>In some deployment scenarios, using PCP anycasting may have certain
        limitations that can be overcome by using additional
        mechanisms or by using other PCP server discovery 
        methods instead, such as 
        DHCP <xref target="RFC7291"/> or a configuration file.</t>

        <t>One important example is a network topology in which a network
        is connected to one or more upstream network(s) via several parallel
        firewalls, each individually controlled by its own PCP server.
        Even if all of these PCP servers are configured for anycasting,
        only one will receive the messages sent by a given client,
        depending on the state of the routing tables.</t>
        
        <t>As long as routing is always symmetric, i.e., all upstream
        and downstream packets from/to that client are routed through
        this very same firewall, communication will be possible as
        expected.  If there is a routing change, a PCP client using PCP
        anycasting might start interacting with a different PCP server.
        From the PCP client's point of view, this would be the same as a
        PCP server reboot and the client could detect it by examining
        the Epoch field during the next PCP response or ANNOUNCE
        message.  The client would re-establish the firewall rules and
        packet flows could resume.</t>

        <t>If, however, routing is asymmetric, upstream packets
        from a client traverse a different firewall than the
        downstream packets to that client.  Establishing policy
        rules in only one of these two firewalls by means of PCP anycasting
        will not have the desired result of allowing bidirectional
        connectivity. One solution approach to overcome this problem is
        an implementation-specific mechanism to synchronize state
        between all firewalls at the border of a network, i.e., a PEER
        message sent to any of these PCP servers would establish rules
        in all firewalls.


  Another approach would be to use a different
        discovery mechanism (e.g., DHCP or a configuration file) that
        allows a PCP client to acquire a list of all PCP servers controlling
        the parallel firewalls and configure each of them individually.
        </t>

	<t>PCP anycast as such allows a PCP client to communicate only with its
	closest upstream PCP server.  However, it may be used in conjunction
	with the PCP proxy function <xref target="RFC7648"/>, in order to support scenarios
	with cascaded PCP-enabled NATs or firewalls.</t>

    <section anchor="sec.security" title="Security Considerations">

	  <t>In addition to the security considerations in 
	  <xref target="RFC6887"/>,
	  <xref target="RFC4786"/>, and
	  <xref target="RFC7094"/>,
      two further security issues are considered here.</t>

	  <section title="Information Leakage through Anycast" anchor="sec.leakage">

      <t>In a network without any border gateway, NAT, or firewall that is
      aware of the PCP anycast address, outgoing PCP requests could leak out
      onto the external Internet, possibly revealing information about
      internal devices.</t>

      <t>Using an IANA-assigned, well-known PCP anycast address enables border
      gateways to block such outgoing packets. In the default-free zone,
      routers should be configured to drop such packets. Such configuration
      can occur naturally via BGP messages advertising that no route exists to
      said address.</t>

      <t>Sensitive clients that do not wish to leak information about their
      presence can set an IP TTL on their PCP requests that limits how far
      they can travel towards the public Internet. However, methods for
      choosing an appropriate TTL value, e.g., based on the assumed radius
      of the trusted network domain, is beyond the
      scope of this document.</t>

      <t>Before sending PCP requests with possibly privacy-sensitive
      parameters (e.g., IP addresses and port numbers) to the PCP anycast
      addresses, PCP clients can send an ANNOUNCE request (without
      parameters; see Section 14.1 of <xref target="RFC6887"/>) in order to
      probe whether a PCP server consumes and processes PCP requests sent to
      that anycast address.</t>

	  </section>

	  <section title="Hijacking of PCP Messages Sent to Anycast Addresses">

	  <t>The anycast addresses are treated by normal host operating systems
	  as normal unicast addresses, i.e., packets destined for an
	  anycast address are sent to the default router for processing and
      forwarding.  Hijacking such packets in the first network segment would
      effectively require the attacker to impersonate the default router,
      e.g., by means of ARP spoofing in an Ethernet network. 
      Once an anycast message is forwarded closer to the core network,
	  routing will likely become subject to dynamic routing protocols such
	  as OSPF or BGP.  Anycast messages could be hijacked by announcing
	  counterfeited messages in these routing protocols.
      When analyzing the risk and possible consequences of such attacks in a given
      network scenario, the probable impacts on PCP signaling need to be put
      into proportion with probable impacts on other protocols such as the
      actual application protocols.</t>

	  <t>In addition to following best current practices in first-hop
	  security and routing-protocol security, PCP authentication 
      <xref target="RFC7652"/> may be useful 
      in some scenarios.  
      However, the effort needed for a proper setup of this authentication
      mechanism (e.g., installing the right shared secrets or cryptographic
      keys on all
      involved systems) may thwart the goal of fully automatic configuration
      by using PCP anycast. 

Therefore, this approach may be less suitable for scenarios
with high trust between the operator of the PCP-controlled middlebox
and all users (e.g., a residential gateway used only by family
members) or in scenarios in which there is rather limited trust that the 
middlebox will behave correctly (e.g., the Wi-Fi in an airport 
lounge). In contrast, this scheme may be highly useful in
      scenarios with many users and a trusted network operator, such as a
      large corporate network or a university campus network, which uses
      several parallel NATs or firewalls to connect to the Internet.
      Therefore, a thorough analysis of the benefits and costs of using PCP
      authentication in a given network scenario is recommended.</t>
