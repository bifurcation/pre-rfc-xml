    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

      <section title="Emergency Services Architecture">

        <t>The emergency services architecture developed in the IETF Emergency Context Resolution
          with Internet Technology (ECRIT) working group, see <xref
            target="RFC6443"/>, describes an architecture where location
          information is provided by access networks to endpoints or VoIP service providers in
          order to determine the correct dial string and information to route the call to a Public
          Safety Answering Point (PSAP). The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol <xref
            target="RFC5222"/> allows callers and other call-routing entities to determine the PSAP
          Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a specific geographical location together with a
          service URN <xref target="RFC5031"/>.


 The basic architecture is shown in Figure 1 of <xref
            target="RFC6443"/> and further detailed in the message flow in Figure 2
          of <xref target="RFC6443"/>. </t>

        <t>For emergency services, location information is needed for three purposes: <list
            style="numbers">
            <t>Emergency call routing to the PSAP that is responsible for a specific geographical
              region.</t>
            <t>Dispatch of the emergency personnel to the scene of an accident, crime, or other type
              of incident.</t>
            <t>Additionally, a Voice Service Provider (VSP) may need to verify that a call is
              indeed an emergency call and may therefore require location information to ensure that
              calls routed to a specific URI point to a PSAP.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>This document focuses on items (1) and (3). Providing location information by the ISP
          to emergency authorities, including PSAPs, regional emergency management association, and emergency personnel is typically a legal obligation covered by
          regulatory frameworks.</t>
      </section>


      <section title="Location Hiding">

        <t>Internet Access Providers (IAPs) and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) typically have
          little incentive to provide location information to end hosts or independent VSPs
          (without monetary compensation) for any purpose, including for emergency call routing. The
          decision to deny disclosure of location information can be driven by a number of technical
          and business concerns. Some providers may perceive a risk that allowing users to access
          location information for non-emergency purposes or prior to an emergency call will incur
          additional server load and thus costs. Other providers may not want to make location
          information available without the ability to charge for it. Yet, others fear problems with
          regard to privacy when disclosing location information to potentially unknown third
          parties.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Location by Reference">

        <t>The work on the Location Configuration Protocol (LCP) indicated the need to provide the
          capability to obtain Location-by-References (LbyRs) in addition to Location-by-Value
          (LbyV) from a Location Information Server (LIS).</t>

        <t> The LCP problem statement and requirements document is <xref
            target="RFC5687"/>. The requirements for obtaining an LbyR via the
          LCP and the corresponding dereferencing step can be found in <xref
            target="RFC5808"/>. </t>

        <t>HTTP Enabled Location Delivery (HELD), see <xref
            target="RFC5985"/>, is an instantiation of the LCP
          concept and allows LbyVs and LbyRs to be requested. </t>

        <t>A location reference may already satisfy the requirement for location hiding if the PSAP
          has the appropriate credentials to resolve the reference. These credentials allow the
          ISP/IAP to authenticate and to authorize the party that would like to request location
          information. The policy to obtain these credentials allows ISPs/IAPs to put constraints
          under which these credentials are handed out. ISPs/IAPs ideally might want to engage in a
          business relationship with the VSP to receive a financial compensation for the service
          they provide. On the Internet, the number of VSPs is potentially large and the VSPs would
          not want to enter a business contract with potentially every ISP/IAP worldwide. The number
          of potential contracts between ISPs/IAPs and PSAPs is, however, relatively small as they
          typically need to have a local relationship as PSAPs provide their emergency services
          support in a certain geographical region for which certain ISPs/IAPs have networks
          deployed. </t>

        <t>Note that the requirement being met here is for delivery of location information to the
          PSAP, not for LoST routing or for validation at the VSP.  Since LoST <xref target="RFC5222" /> requires location by value, location by reference cannot be used for location-based routing. Also, LoST servers may be
          operated by independent parties, including VSPs, which again may not be able to resolve
          the reference to location by value. (Note that LoST is a protocol used for determining the
          location-appropriate PSAP based on location information and a Service URN <xref
            target="RFC5031"/>.)</t>

              user agents cannot require additional configuration to discover in which particular
              environment (hiding or no hiding) they find themselves. </t>
            <t hangText="Req-9:">The solution SHOULD work without the ISP/IAP having to support SIP
              and without the need to utilize SIP between the endpoint and the VSP. </t>
            <t hangText="Req-10:">The solution MUST work if PSAP boundaries have holes. (For a
              discussion about holes in PSAP boundaries and their encoding, the reader is referred to
                <xref target="RFC5964"/>.)</t>
            <t hangText="Req-11:">The solution MUST NOT assume the existence of Emergency Service
              Routing Proxies (ESRPs) per country, state, and city. </t>
            <t hangText="Req-12:">The solution MUST consider that service boundaries for different
              emergency services may differ, but they overlap at the location of the caller.</t>
            <t hangText="Req-13:"> Though the solution MAY add steps to the emergency call routing
              process described in <xref target="RFC6443"/>, these steps MUST NOT
              significantly increase call setup latency. For example, the revised process MUST NOT
              include "trial-and-error" operations on its critical path, such as attempts at LbyR
              resolutions that may take time to time out. </t>
            <t hangText="Req-14:">The solution MUST allow the end host to determine PSAP/ESRP URLs
              prior to the call, for all emergency services. </t>
            <t hangText="Req-15:">The solution MUST allow user agents (UAs) to discover at least their dial string
              ahead of the emergency call. </t>
            <t hangText="Req-16:">The solution MUST have minimal impact on UAs, i.e., a solution is
              preferred if it does not require a substantially different emergency service
              procedure compared to the procedure of dealing with emergency services where no
              location hiding is applied. </t>

              non-emergency services. </t>
            <t hangText="Req-18:">The solution MUST allow emergency calls to reach an IP-to-PSTN
              gateway rather than the IP-based PSAP directly. </t>
            <t hangText="Req-19:">The solution MUST NOT shift effort (externality), i.e., the
              convenience of the location-hiding ISP MUST NOT impose a burden on user agents or
              non-hiding ISPs/IAPs and SHOULD NOT impose a burden on VSPs.</t>
            <t hangText="Req-20:">The solution SHOULD minimize the impact on LoST, SIP conveyance

<t>This document provides a problem statement, lists requirements, and captures design aspects for a GEOPRIV Layer 7 (L7) Location Configuration Protocol (LCP).  This protocol aims to allow an end host to obtain location information, by value or by reference, from a Location Information Server (LIS) that is located in the access network.  The obtained location information can then be used for a variety of different protocols and purposes.  For example, it can be used as input to the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Protocol or to convey location within the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to other entities.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract></front>

The protocol is an extensible application-layer protocol that is independent of the session layer. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>
