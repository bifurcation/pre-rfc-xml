    <abstract>
      <t>
      The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is used in conjunction with the Real-
      time Transport Protocol (RTP) in order to provide a variety of short-term and
      long-term reception statistics. The available reporting may include
      aggregate information across longer periods of time as well as
      individual packet reporting. This document specifies a per-packet report
      metric capturing individual packets discarded from the de-jitter buffer
      after successful reception.
      </t>
    </abstract>

  <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
    <t>
      <xref target="RFC3550">RTP</xref> provides a transport for real-time
      media flows such as audio and video together with the RTP Control
      Protocol (RTCP), which provides periodic feedback about the media streams
      received in a specific duration. In addition, RTCP can be used for
      timely feedback about individual events to report (e.g., packet loss)
      <xref target="RFC4585"/>. Both long-term and short-term feedback enable
      a media sender to adapt its media transmission and/or encoding 
      dynamically to the observed path characteristics.
    </t>

    <t>
      <xref target="RFC3611">RFC 3611</xref> defines RTCP Extended Reports as a
      detailed reporting framework to provide more than just the coarse
      Receiver Report (RR) statistics. The detailed reporting may enable a
      media sender to react more appropriately to the observed networking
      conditions as these can be characterized better, although at the expense
      of extra overhead.
    </t>
    <t>
      Among many other report blocks, RFC 3611 specifies the Loss Run Length
      Encoding (RLE) block, which reports runs of packets received and lost
      with the granularity of individual packets. This can help both error
      recovery and path loss characterization. In addition to lost packets,
      RFC 3611 defines the notion of "discarded" packets: packets that were
      received but dropped from the de-jitter buffer because they were either
      too early (for buffering) or too late (for playout). The "discard rate"
      metric is part of the Voice over IP (VoIP) metrics report block even though it is not
      just applicable to audio: it is specified as the fraction of discarded
      packets since the beginning of the session (see Section 4.7.1 of <xref
      target="RFC3611">RFC 3611</xref>). The discard metric is believed to be
      applicable to a large class of RTP applications that use a de-jitter
      buffer <xref target="RFC5481"></xref>.
    </t>
    <t>
      Recently proposed extensions to the Extended Reports (XRs) reporting
      suggest enhancing this discard metric:
      <list style="symbols">
    <t>
      Reporting the number of discarded packets in a measurement interval,
      i.e., either during the last reporting interval or since the beginning
      of the session, as indicated by a flag in the suggested XR <xref
      target="RFC7002"/>. If an endpoint needs to
      report packet discard due to reasons other than early and late arrival
      (for example, discard due to duplication, redundancy, etc.), then it
      should consider using the Discarded Packets report block <xref
      target="RFC7002"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
      Reporting gaps and bursts of discarded packets during a measurement
      interval, i.e., the last reporting interval or the duration of the
      session <xref target="RFC7003"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
      Reporting the sum of payload bytes discarded during a measurement
      interval, i.e., the last reporting interval or the duration of the
      session 
      <xref target="DISCARD-METRIC"/>.
    </t>
      </list>
    </t>
    <t>
      However, none of these metrics allow a receiver to report precisely
      which packets were discarded. While this information could in theory be
      derived from high-frequency reporting on the number of discarded packets
      <xref target="RFC7002"/> or from the gap/burst
      report <xref target="RFC7003"/>,
      these two mechanisms do not appear feasible: the former would require an
      unduly high amount of reporting, which still might not be sufficient due
      to the non-deterministic scheduling of RTCP packets. The latter incurs
      significant complexity and reporting overhead and might still not
      deliver the desired accuracy.
    </t>
    <t>
      This document defines a discard report block following the idea of the
      run-length encoding applied for lost and received packets in 
      <xref target="RFC3611" />.

    same semantics and representation as defined in <xref target="RFC3611" />,
    with the addition of the "E" flag to indicate the reason for discard. The
    "chunks" encoding the run length have the same representation as in

  Block Type (BT, 8 bits): A Discard RLE report block is 
      identified by the constant 25.
  </t>
 
  <t>
    rsvd (3 bits): This field is reserved for future definition. In the
    absence of such definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
    MUST be ignored by the receiver.
    <!-- These reserved bits MUST be set to zero by media receivers and MUST
    be ignored by media senders. -->
  </t>
  <t>
    The 'E' bit is introduced to distinguish between packets discarded due
    to early arrival and those discarded due to late arrival.  The 'E' bit
    is set to '1' if the chunks represent packets discarded due to
    arriving too early and is set to '0' otherwise.
  </t>
  <t>
    In case both early and late discarded packets shall be reported, two
    Discard RLE report blocks MUST be included; their sequence number range
    MAY overlap, but individual packets MUST only be reported as either early
    or late and not appear marked in both. If packets appear in both report 
    blocks, the conflicting packets will be ignored. Packets not reported in either block
    are considered to be properly received and not discarded.
  </t>
  <t>
    Discard RLE report blocks SHOULD be sent in conjunction with an RTCP RR
    as a compound RTCP packet.

  <t>
    This section describes the behavior of the reporting node (= media 
    receiver) and the media sender.
  </t>
  <section title="Reporting Node (Receiver)">
    <t>
      Transmission of RTCP XR Discard RLE report blocks is up to the discretion of
      the media receiver, as is the reporting granularity. However, it is
      RECOMMENDED that the media receiver signal all discarded packets using
      the method defined in this document. If all packets over a reporting
      period are discarded, the media receiver MAY use the Discard Report
      Block <xref target="RFC7002"/> instead. In case
      of limited available reporting bandwidth, it is up to the receiver
      whether or not to include RTCP XR Discard RLE report blocks.
    </t>
    <t>
      The media receiver MAY send the Discard RLE report blocks as part of the
      regularly scheduled RTCP packets, as per RFC 3550. It MAY also include
      Discard RLE report blocks in immediate or early feedback packets, as per
      RFC 4585.
    </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Media Sender">
    <t>
      The media sender MUST be prepared to operate without receiving any
      Discard RLE report blocks.  If Discard RLE report blocks are generated by the
      media receiver, the media sender cannot rely on all these reports being
      received, nor can the media sender rely on a regular generation 
      pattern from the media receiver.
    </t>
    <t>
      However, if the media sender receives RTCP XR reports but the 
     reports contain no Discard RLE report blocks and is aware that the media receiver supports 
      Discard RLE report blocks, it MAY assume that no packets were discarded 
      at the media receiver.
    </t>

</section>

<section title="SDP Signaling" anchor="sdp">
<!--  <t>
    The report blocks specified in this document define extensions to RTCP XR
    reporting. Whether or not this specific extended report is sent is left to
    the discretion of the receiver. Its presence may enable better operation
    of the sender since more detailed information is available. Not providing
    this information will make the sender rely on other RTCP reports.
  </t> -->
  <t>
    A participant of a media session MAY use SDP to signal its support for the
    report block specified in this document or use them without any prior
    signaling (see Section 5 of <xref target="RFC3611">RFC 3611</xref>).
  </t>
  <t>
    For signaling in SDP, the RTCP XR attribute as defined in RFC 3611 <xref
    target="RFC3611" /> MUST be used. The SDP <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>
    attribute 'xr-format' defined in RFC 3611 is augmented as described in the
    following to indicate the discard RLE metric.

   xr-format       =/ xr-discard-rle

   xr-discard-rle   = "discard-rle"
   ]]></artwork>
    </figure>
  </t>
  <t>
    The parameter 'discard-rle' is used to indicate support for the
    Discard RLE report block defined in <xref target="spec"/>.
  </t>
<!--  <t>
    For signaling support of the RLE discard metric and bytes discarded
    metric, the rules defined in RFC3611 apply. Generally, senders and
    receivers SHOULD indicate this capability if they support these metrics
    and would like to use it in the specific media session being signaled. The
    receiver MAY decide not to send discard information unless it knows about
    the sender's support to save on RTCP reporting bandwidth.
  </t> -->
  <t>
    When SDP is used in Offer/Answer context, the mechanism defined in <xref
    target="RFC3611">RFC 3611</xref> for unilateral "rtcp-xr" attribute parameters applies
    (see Section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC3611">RFC 3611</xref>).
  </t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
  <t>
    The Discard RLE report block provides per-packet statistics so the risk to
    confidentiality documented in Section 7, Paragraph 3, of <xref
    target="RFC3611">RFC 3611</xref> applies. In some situations, returning very detailed
    error information (e.g., over-range measurement or measurement
    unavailable) using this report block can provide an attacker with insight
    into the security processing. Implementers should consider the guidance in
    <xref target="NO-SRTP" /> for using appropriate
    security mechanisms, i.e., where security is a concern, the implementation
    should apply encryption and authentication to the report block. For
    example, this can be achieved by using the AVPF profile together with the
    Secure RTP profile as defined in <xref target="RFC3711">RFC 3711</xref>; an appropriate
    combination of the two profiles (an "SAVPF") is specified in <xref
    target="RFC5124">RFC 5124</xref>. However, other mechanisms also exist <xref target="SRTP-OPTIONS" /> and might be more
    suitable.
