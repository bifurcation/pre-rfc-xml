    <abstract>
    <t>
   This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) for Uniform
   Resource Namespace (URN) resources published by the 3rd Generation
   Partnership Project (3GPP). 3GPP defines and manages resources
   that utilize this URN name model. Management activities for these
   and other resource types are provided by the 3GPP Support Team.

<section title="Introduction">
<t>
3GPP is a cooperation of international telecommunication standards bodies
developing technologies for cellular networks. This activity is supported
by a membership composed of network operators, equipment vendors, content
providers, and other suppliers to the mobile market.
</t>

<t>
Some of the technologies being developed by 3GPP need URN namespaces
that are managed so that they are unique and persistent. To assure
that the uniqueness is absolute, the registration of a specific NID
for use by 3GPP was deemed appropriate. Therefore, a full and
complete registration will follow the namespace specification process
as defined in <xref target="RFC3406">RFC 3406</xref>.

Identifier uniqueness considerations:
</t>

<t><list style="empty">
<t>
3GPP will manage resources using the "3gpp" NID and will be the
authority for managing the "3gpp-urn" strings.
In the associated procedures, 3GPP will ensure the
uniqueness of the strings themselves or shall permit secondary
responsibility for management of well-defined sub-trees.
</t>
</list></t>

<t><list style="empty">
<t>
3GPP may permit use of experimental type values that will not be
registered. As a consequence, multiple users may end up using the
same value for separate uses. Unregistered type values will only
be allowed in sub-namespaces clearly marked as experimental,
to help implementors avoid "leaking" experimental values into
real use.
</t>
</list></t>


<t>

</t>
<t>
Identifier persistence considerations:
</t>

<t><list style="empty">
<t>
3GPP will provide clear documentation of the registered uses of
the "3gpp" NID. This will be structured such that each "3gpp-urn",
if needed, will have a separate description and registration table.
</t>
</list></t>

<t><list style="empty">
<t>
The registration tables and information will be published and
maintained by 3GPP on its web site.

</t>
<t>
Process of identifier assignment:
</t>

<t><list style="empty">
<t>
3GPP will provide procedures for registration of each type of
resource that it maintains. Each such resource may have three
types of registration activities:
</t>
<t><list style="numbers">
<t>
Registered values associated with 3GPP specifications or services
</t>
<t>
Registration of values or sub-trees to other entities

<section title="Examples" anchor="sec-ex">
<t>
The following examples are representative URNs that could be assigned
by 3GPP. They are not actual strings that are assigned.
</t>
<t>
urn:3gpp:featurephones
</t>
<t><list style="empty">
<t>
Defines the "3gpp-urn" to be used for "featurephones".
</t>
</list></t>

<t>
urn:3gpp:acme.foo-serv
</t>
<t><list style="empty">
<t>
Defines the URN associated with the operator identified by the "3gpp-urn" value "acme", which has decided
to register and provide information about its service identified by value "foo-serv".
</t>
</list></t>

<section title="Namespace Considerations" anchor="sec-Name">
<t>
The 3rd Generation Partnership Project is developing a variety of 
enablers and applications.  Some of these require information to be
fully specified.
</t>
<t>
For proper operation, descriptions of the needed information must exist
for the URNs and be available in a unique, reliable, and persistent
manner. 
</t>
<t>
As 3GPP is ongoing and covers many technical areas, the possibility of
binding to various other namespace repositories has been deemed
impractical.  Each object or description, as defined in 3GPP, could
possibly be related to multiple different other namespaces, so further
conflicts of association could occur.  Thus, the intent is to utilize
the 3GPP specifications manager as the naming authority for 3GPP-defined
URNs and its descriptions.
</t>
</section>


<section title="Community Considerations" anchor="sec-Community">
<t>
The objects and descriptions required for enablers produced by 3GPP
are generally available for use by other organizations.  The 3rd 
Generation Partnership Project Support Office will provide access and
support for name requests by these organizations.  This support can be
enabled in a timely and responsive fashion as new objects and 
descriptions are produced.
</t>
</section>


<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sec-security">
<t>
There are no security considerations other than those
normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.
</t>
</section>


<section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="sec-IANA">
<t>
This section registers a new URN NID with the registration provided in Section 2.
</t>
<t>
"3gpp-urn" strings are identified by label managed by 3GPP.
Thus, creating a new label does not require any IANA action.
