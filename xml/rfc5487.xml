           <abstract>
<t>RFC 4279 and RFC 4785 describe pre-shared key cipher suites for
  Transport Layer Security (TLS).  However, all those cipher suites
  use SHA-1 in their Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm.
  This document describes a set of pre-shared key cipher suites for
  TLS that uses stronger digest algorithms (i.e., SHA-256 or SHA-384)
  and another set that uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 
  in Galois Counter Mode (GCM).</t>

<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
<t>The benefits of pre-shared symmetric-key vs. public-/private-key 
   pair based authentication for the key exchange in TLS have been 
   explained in the Introduction of <xref target="RFC4279"/>. This 
   document leverages the already defined algorithms for the application 
   of newer, generally regarded stronger, cryptographic primitives and
   building blocks. </t>

<t>TLS 1.2 <xref target="RFC5246"/> adds support for authenticated
  encryption with additional data (AEAD) cipher modes
  <xref target="RFC5116"/>. This document describes the use of
  Advanced Encryption Standard <xref target="AES"/> in Galois
  Counter Mode <xref target="GCM"/> (AES-GCM) with various pre-shared
  key (PSK) authenticated key exchange mechanisms (<xref target="RFC4279"/> 
  and <xref target="RFC4785"/>) in cipher suites for TLS. </t>

<t>This document also specifies PSK cipher suites for TLS that replace 
   SHA-1 by SHA-256 or SHA-384 <xref target="SHS"/>.  
   RFC 4279 <xref target="RFC4279"/> and RFC 4785 <xref target="RFC4785"/> 
   describe PSK cipher suites for TLS.  However, all of the RFC 4279 and 
   the RFC 4785 cipher suites use HMAC-SHA1 as their MAC algorithm.  Due 
   to recent analytic work on SHA-1 <xref target="Wang05"/>, the IETF is 
   gradually moving away from SHA-1 and towards stronger hash algorithms. </t>

<t>Related TLS cipher suites with key exchange algorithms that are 
   authenticated using public/private key pairs have recently been specified: </t>


<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>RSA-, DSS-, and Diffie-Hellman-based cipher suites in <xref target="RFC5288"/>, and</t>
<t>ECC-based cipher suites with SHA-256/384 and AES-GCM in <xref target="RFC5289"/>.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>The reader is expected to become familiar with these two memos prior to 
   studying this document. </t>
		
<section title="Applicability Statement ">
<t>The cipher suites defined in <xref target="with_SHA"/> can be negotiated,

<t>The cipher suites defined in <xref target="with_AES-GCM"/> can be 
   negotiated in TLS version 1.2 or higher. </t>

<t>The applicability statement in <xref target="RFC4279" /> applies to
  this document as well.

  <xref target="GCM"/>.  The cipher suites with the DHE_PSK key exchange algorithm 
  (TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA348) 
   provide Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).

<t>These cipher suites use authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD)

   <xref target="RFC5246"/> with SHA-384 as the hash function.</t>
