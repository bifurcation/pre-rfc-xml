       <abstract>

     <t> 
       This document proposes a framework for the management of the
       Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) Endpoint Identifier (EID) address block.
       The framework described relies on hierarchical distribution of
       the address space, granting temporary usage of prefixes of
       such space to requesting organizations.

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">

      <t> The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP <xref target="RFC6830" />) and related mechanisms 
      (<xref target="RFC6831" />,
       <xref target="RFC6832" />,
       <xref target="RFC6833" />,
       <xref target="RFC6834" />,
       <xref target="RFC6835" />,
       <xref target="RFC6836" />, <xref target="RFC6837" />) separate the IP addressing space into two logical spaces, the Endpoint
       Identifier (EID) space and the Routing Locator (RLOC)
       space. The first space is used to identify communication
       endpoints, while the second is used to locate EIDs in the
       Internet routing infrastructure topology. 
      </t>

      <t><xref target="RFC7954"/>
      requests an IPv6 address block reservation exclusively for use 
      as EID prefixes in the LISP experiment. The rationale,
      intent, size, and usage of the EID address block are described
      in <xref target="RFC7954"/>. 
      </t>

      <t> This document proposes a management framework for the
      registration of EID prefixes from that block,  allowing the
      requesting organization exclusive use of those EID prefixes
      limited to the duration of the LISP experiment. 
      </t>

    <section title="Requirements Notation">

      <t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
      "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
      and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
      described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
      </t>
 
    </section> 


    <section title="Definition of Terms" anchor="definitions">
      
      <t> This document does not introduce any new terms related to
      the set of LISP Specifications  
      (<xref target="RFC6830" />,
        <xref target="RFC6831" />, 
	<xref target="RFC6832" />,
	<xref target="RFC6833" />,
	<xref target="RFC6834" />,
	<xref target="RFC6835" />,
	<xref target="RFC6836" />, <xref target="RFC6837" />), but assumes that the reader is 
	familiar with the LISP terminology. 
<xref target="INTRO"/> provides an
	introduction to the LISP technology, including its 
	terminology. 
</t>
      
      </section>

      <section title="EID Prefix Registration Policy" anchor="policy">

	<t> The request for registration of EID prefixes MUST be done under the
	following policies:

	<list hangIndent="2" style="numbers">

	  <t>EID prefixes are made available in the reserved space on
	  a temporary basis and for experimental uses. 
	  The requester of an experimental prefix MUST
	  provide a short description of the intended use or
	  experiment that will be carried out (see 
	  <xref target="template"/>). If the prefix will be used for
	  activities not documented in the original description, 
	  renewal of the registration may be denied. 
	  <!-- or withdrawn (see <xref target="req"/>). -->  
	  </t> 

	<t>  EID prefix registrations MUST be renewed on a regular
	basis to ensure their use by active participants in the
        experiment. The registration period is 12 months. 
	A renewal SHOULD NOT cause a change in the EID prefix 
	registered in the previous request. 
	The conditions of registration renewal are to be the same as the 
	conditions of the first EID prefix registration request.
 	</t>


	  <t>It is preferable that EID prefixes whose 
      registrations have expired not be reused.
      When an EID prefix registration is removed from the
	  registry, then the reuse of the EID prefix in a subsequent
	  registration on behalf of a different end user should be
	  avoided where possible. If the considerations of overall
	  usage of the EID block prefix requires reuse of a previously
	  registered EID prefix, then a minimum delay of at least one
	  week between removal and subsequent registration SHOULD be
	  applied by the registry operator.
	  </t>

	   <t> When the reserved experimental LISP EID block expires, all EID
	   prefix registrations expire as well. The further disposition of these prefixes and the
	  associated registry entries are to be specified in the
	  announcement of the cessation of this experiment.
	  </t>


	</list>

      </section>

      <section title="EID Prefixes Registration Requirements" anchor="req">

	<t>All EID prefix registrations MUST satsify the
	following requirements:  

 	<list hangIndent="2" style="numbers">

	  <t> All EID prefix registrations MUST use a globally unique
	  EID prefix.
	  </t>
	  

	  <t>The EID prefix registration information, as specified in
	  <xref target="template"/>, MUST be collected upon initial
	  registration and renewal, and made publicly available through
	  interfaces allowing both the retrieval of specific registration
	  details (search) and the enumeration of the entire registry
	  contents (e.g., RDAP (<xref target="RFC7481"/>),
	  WHOIS, HTTP, or similar access methods).
	  </t>

	  <t>The registry operator MUST permit the delegation of EID
	  prefixes in the reverse DNS space to holders of registered
	  EID prefixes. 
	  </t>
 
	  <t>Anyone can obtain an entry in the EID prefix registry, on
	  the understanding that the prefix so registered is for the
	  exclusive use in the LISP experimental network, and  that
	  their registration details (as specified in 
	  <xref target="template"/>) are openly published in the EID
	  prefix registry.

      <section title="Policy Validity Period" anchor="next">

	<t> The policy outlined in the present document is tied to the
	existence of the experimental LISP EID block requested in 
	<xref target="RFC7954"/> and is valid until 
	August 2019. 
	</t>

	<t> If the IETF decides to transform the block into a permanent
	allocation, the usage period reserved for the LISP EID block will be
	extended for three years (until August 2022) to allow
	time for the IETF to define, following the policies outlined in 
	<xref target="RFC5226"/>, the final size of the EID block and 
	create a transition plan, while the policy in the present
	document will still apply. 
	</t>

	<t> Note that, as stated in 
	<xref target="RFC7954"/>, the transition of
	the EID block into a permanent allocation has the potential
	to pose policy issues (as recognized in 
	<xref target="RFC2860"/>, Section 4.3); hence, discussion
	with the IANA, the Regional Internet Registry (RIR) communities, and the IETF community
	will be necessary to determine the appropriate policy for
	permanent EID prefix management, which will be
	effective after August 2022.  
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Security Considerations" toc="default">

	<t>
	  This document does not introduce new security threats in
	  the LISP architecture nor in the Legacy Internet architecture. 
	</t>

	<t> 
	  For accountability reasons and in line with the security
	  considerations in <xref target="RFC7020"/>, each registration
	  request MUST contain accurate information about the requesting
	  entity (company, institution, individual, etc.) and valid
	  and accurate contact information of a referral person (see
	  <xref target="template"/>).  
	</t> 

      </section>

      <section title="IANA Considerations" toc="default">

	<t>IANA allocated the following IPv6 address block for 
	experimental use as the LISP EID prefix 
	<xref target="RFC7954"/>:
	</t>
	
	<t> 
	<list hangIndent="2" style="symbols">
	
		<t>Address Block: 2001:5::/32

		<t>Further details are at: www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry

		</t>

	</t>

	<t>To grant requesting organizations and individuals
	exclusive use of EID prefixes out of this reserved block 
	(limited to the duration of the LISP experiment as outlined in 
	<xref target="next"/>), there is an operational requirement for an 
	EID registration service.  
	</t>
	
	<t>Provided that the policies and requirements outlined in Sections 
	<xref target="policy" format="counter" />, <xref target="req"
	format="counter" />, 
	and <xref target="template" format="counter" /> are satsified, EID prefix 
	registration is accorded based on a 
	"First Come First Served" basis. 
	</t>

	<t>There is no hard limit to the number of registrations an 
	organization or individual can submit, as long as the information 
	described in <xref target="template"/> is provided, in 
	particular point 4: "Experiment Description".
	</t>
	
	<t>For the duration defined in <xref target="RFC7954"/>,
	RIPE NCC will manage the LISP EID prefix as described herein.
	Therefore, this document has no IANA actions.

      </section>

      <section title="Procedures to be Followed by RIPE NCC"
	       anchor="ripe" toc="default">

	<t>RIPE NCC will provide the registration service following
	the EID Prefix Registration Policy (<xref target="policy"/>)

	The request form provided by RIPE NCC will include at least
	the information from the template in
