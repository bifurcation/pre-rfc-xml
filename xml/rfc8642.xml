  <abstract>
    <t>Well-known BGP communities are manipulated differently across
    various current implementations, resulting in difficulties for
    operators.  Network operators should deploy consistent community
    handling across their networks while taking the inconsistent
    behaviors from the various BGP implementations into consideration.
    This document recommends specific actions to limit future
    inconsistency: namely, BGP implementors must not create further
    inconsistencies from this point forward.  These behavioral changes, though
    subtle, actually update RFC 1997.</t>
  </abstract>

  <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

    <t>The BGP Communities attribute was specified in <xref
    target="RFC1997"/>, which introduced the concept of well-known
    communities.  In hindsight, <xref target="RFC1997"/> did not
    prescribe as fully as it should have how well-known communities may
    be manipulated by policies applied by operators.  Currently,
    implementations differ in this regard, and these differences can
    result in inconsistent behaviors that operators find difficult to
    identify and resolve.</t>

    <t>This document describes the current behavioral differences in
    order to assist operators in generating consistent
    community-manipulation policies in a multi-vendor environment and
    to prevent the introduction of additional divergence in
    implementations.</t>

    <t>This document recommends specific actions to limit future
    inconsistency: namely, BGP implementors MUST NOT create further
    inconsistencies from this point forward.</t>

        <t>
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
    described in BCP&nbsp;14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> 
    when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
        </t>

    </section>

  <section anchor="manip" title="Manipulation of Communities by Policy">
    
    <t><xref target="RFC1997"/> says:
 <list>
    <t>A BGP speaker receiving a route with the COMMUNITIES path
    attribute may modify this attribute according to the local
    policy.</t>
 </list>
    </t>

    <t>One basic operational need is to add or remove one or more
    communities to or from the set.  The focus of this document is
    another common operational need: to replace all communities with a
    new set.  To simplify this second case, most BGP policy
    implementations provide a syntax to "set" a community that operators use
    to mean "remove any/all communities present on the route and apply
    this set of communities instead".</t>

    <t>Some operators prefer to write explicit policy to delete unwanted
    communities rather than use "set", i.e., using "delete community
    *:*" and then "add community x:y ..." configuration statements in an
    attempt to replace all communities.  The same community-manipulation policy differences described in the following section
    exist in the syntax for both "set" and "delete community *:*".  For
    simplicity, the remainder of this document refers only to the "set"
    behaviors, which we refer to collectively as each implementation's
    '"set" directive'.</t>

    </section>

  <section anchor="diffs" title="Community Manipulation Policy Differences">
    
    <t>Vendor implementations differ in the treatment of certain
    well-known communities when modified using the syntax to "set" the
    community.  Some replace all communities, including the well-known
    ones, with the new set; others replace all non-well-known
    communities but do not modify any well-known communities that are
    present.</t>

    <t>These differences result in what would appear to be identical
    policy configurations having very different results on different
    platforms.</t>

    </section>

  <section anchor="impls" title="Documentation of Vendor Implementations">

    <t>In this section, we document the syntax and observed behavior of
    the "set" directive in several popular BGP implementations to
    illustrate the severity of the problem operators face.</t>

    <t>In Juniper Networks' Junos OS, "community set" removes all
    communities, well-known or otherwise.</t>

    <t>In Cisco IOS XR, "set community" removes all communities except
    for the following:</t>

    <texttable anchor="cisco" title="Communities Not Removed by Cisco's IOS XR">
      <preamble></preamble>
        <ttcol align="left">Numeric</ttcol>
        <ttcol align="left">Common Name</ttcol>
          <c>0:0</c>          <c>internet</c>
          <c>65535:0</c>      <c>graceful-shutdown</c>
          <c>65535:1</c>      <c>accept-own rfc7611</c>
          <c>65535:65281</c>  <c>NO_EXPORT</c>
          <c>65535:65282</c>  <c>NO_ADVERTISE</c>
          <c>65535:65283</c>  <c>NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED (or local-AS)</c>
        <postamble/>
      </texttable>

    <t>Cisco IOS XR allows well-known communities to be removed only
    by explicitly enumerating one at a time and not in the aggregate -- for
    example, "delete community accept-own".  Operators are advised to
    consult Cisco IOS XR documentation and/or Cisco support for full
    details.</t>

    <t>On Extreme networks' Brocade NetIron, "set community X" removes
    all communities and sets X.</t>

    <t>In Huawei's VRP product, "community set" removes all communities,
    well-known or otherwise.</t>

    <t>In OpenBGPD, "set community" does not remove any communities,
    well-known or otherwise.</t>

    <t>Nokia's SR OS has several directives that operate on communities.
    Its "set" directive is called using the "replace" keyword, replacing
    all communities, well-known or otherwise, with the specified
    communities.</t>

    <section anchor="ianalist" title="Note on an Inconsistency">

      <t>IANA publishes a list of well-known communities <xref
      target="IANA-WKC"/>.</t>

      <t>Cisco IOS XR's set of well-known communities that "set
      community" will not overwrite diverges from the IANA's list of
      well-known communities. Quite a few well-known communities from
      IANA's list do not receive special treatment in Cisco IOS XR, and at
      least one community on Cisco IOS XR's special treatment list,
      internet == 0:0, is not formally a well-known community as it is
      not in <xref target="IANA-WKC"/> (it is taken from the Reserved
      range [0x00000000-0x0000FFFF]).</t>

      <t>This merely notes an inconsistency.  It is not a plea to
      protect the entire IANA list from "set community".</t>

      </section>

    </section>
    
  <section anchor="note" title="Note for Those Writing RFCs for New Community-Like Attributes"> 

    <t>When establishing new attributes similar to those in <xref target="RFC1997"/> (large
    communities, wide communities, etc.), RFC authors should state
    explicitly how the new attribute is to be handled.</t>

    </section>

  <section anchor="actions" title="Action Items">

    <t>Network operators are encouraged to limit their use of the "set"
    directive (within reason) to improve consistency across
    platforms.</t>

    <t>Unfortunately, it would be operationally disruptive for vendors
    to change their current implementations.</t>

    <t>Vendors MUST clearly document the behavior of the "set" directive
    in their implementations.</t>

    <t>Vendors MUST ensure that their implementations' "set" directive
    treatment of any specific community does not change if/when that
    community becomes a new well-known community through future
    standardization.  For most implementations, this means that the
    "set" directive MUST continue to remove the community; for those
    implementations where the "set" directive removes no communities,
    that behavior MUST continue.</t>

    <t>Given the implementation inconsistencies described in this
    document, network operators are urged never to rely on any implicit
    understanding of a neighbor ASN's BGP community
    handling.  That is,
    before announcing prefixes with NO_EXPORT or any other community to
    a neighbor ASN, the operator should confirm with that neighbor how
    the community will be treated.</t>
