    <abstract>
      <t>
      Users have various human (i.e., natural) language needs, abilities, and
      preferences regarding spoken, written, and signed languages.  This
      document defines new Session Description Protocol (SDP) media-level
      attributes so that when establishing interactive communication sessions
      ("calls"), it is possible to negotiate (i.e., communicate and match) the
      caller's language and media needs with the capabilities of the called
      party. This is especially important for emergency calls, because it
      allows for a call to be handled by a call taker capable of communicating with the user or for a
   translator or relay operator to be bridged into the call during
   setup. However, this also applies to non-emergency calls (for
   example, calls to a company call center).
      </t>

      <t>
      This document describes the need as well as a solution that uses new SDP media attributes.

    <section title="Introduction">

    <t>
    A mutually comprehensible language is helpful for human communication.
    This document addresses the negotiation of human language and
    media modality (spoken, signed, or written) in real-time communications.  A companion document <xref target="RFC8255"/> addresses language selection in email.
    </t>
    <t>
    Unless the caller and callee know each other or there is contextual or
    out-of-band information from which the language(s) and media modalities
    can be determined, there is a need for spoken, signed, or written
    languages to be negotiated based on the caller's needs and the callee's
    capabilities. This need applies to both emergency and non-emergency
    calls. 

   An example of a non-emergency call is when a caller
   contacts a company call center; an emergency call typically involves a caller contacting a Public Safety Answering Point
   (PSAP). In such scenarios, it is helpful for the caller to be able to indicate preferred
   signed, written, and/or spoken languages and for the callee to be
   able to indicate its capabilities; this allows the call
   to proceed using the language(s) and media forms supported by both.

</t>
    <t>
    For various reasons, including the ability to establish multiple streams
    using different media (i.e., voice, text, and/or video), it makes sense to use a per-stream negotiation mechanism known as the Session Description Protocol (SDP). Utilizing SDP <xref target="RFC4566"/> enables the solution described in this document to be applied to all interactive communications negotiated using SDP, in emergency as well as non-emergency scenarios.    
    </t>
    <t>
    By treating language as another SDP attribute that is negotiated along
    with other aspects of a media stream, it becomes possible to accommodate a
    range of users' needs and called-party facilities. 

For example, some users may be able to speak several languages but have a
preference. Some called parties may support some of those languages internally
but require the use of a translation service for others, or they may have a
limited number of call takers able to use certain languages. Another example
would be a user who is able to speak but is deaf or hard of hearing and desires a voice stream to send spoken language plus a text stream to receive written language. Making language a media attribute allows standard session negotiation to handle this by providing the information and mechanism for the endpoints to make appropriate decisions.    
    </t>
    <t>
    The term "negotiation" is used here rather than "indication" because human
    language (spoken/written/signed) can be negotiated in the same manner as
    media (audio/text/video) and codecs. For example, if we think of a user
    calling an airline reservation center, the user may be able to use a set of
    languages, perhaps with preferences for one or a few, while the airline reservation center may support a fixed set of languages. Negotiation should select the user's most preferred language that is supported by the call center. Both sides should be aware of which language was negotiated.
    </t>
    <t>
    In the offer/answer model used here, the offer contains a set of languages
    per media (and direction) that the offerer is capable of using, and the
    answer contains one language per media (and direction) that the answerer
    will support.  
   Supporting languages and/or
   modalities can require taking extra steps, such as bridging external translation
   or relay resources into the call or having a call
   handled by an agent who speaks a requested language and/or has the
   ability to use a requested modality.
The answer indicates the media and languages that the answerer is committing to support (possibly after additional steps have been taken).  This model also provides knowledge so both ends know what has been negotiated.  Note that additional steps required to support the indicated languages or modalities may or may not be in place in time for any early media.
    </t>

<t>Since this is a protocol mechanism, the user equipment (UE) client
   needs to know the user's preferred languages; while this document
   does not address how clients determine this, reasonable techniques
   could include a configuration mechanism with a default of the
   language of the user interface. In some cases, a UE client could tie
   language and media preferences, such as a preference for a video
   stream using a signed language and/or a text or audio stream using a
   written/spoken language.
    </t>
    <t>
    This document does not address user interface (UI) issues, such as if or how a UE client informs a user about the result of language and media negotiation.
    </t>

    <section title="Applicability">

    <t>
    Within this document, it is assumed that the negotiating endpoints have already been determined so that a per-stream negotiation based on SDP can proceed.
    </t>
    <t>When setting up interactive communication sessions, it is necessary to route signaling messages to the appropriate endpoint(s). This document does not address the problem of language-based routing.

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL

    when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
        </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Desired Semantics">
    <t>
   The desired solution is a media attribute (preferably per direction)
   that may be used within an offer to indicate the preferred
   language(s) of each (direction of a) media stream and within an
   answer to indicate the accepted language. When
   multiple languages are included for a media stream within an offer, the
   languages are listed in order of preference (most preferred first).
    </t>
    
    <t>
    Note that negotiating multiple simultaneous languages within a media
    stream is out of scope of this document.
    </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="existing" title="The Existing 'lang' Attribute">
    
    <t>
    RFC 4566 <xref target="RFC4566"/> specifies an attribute 'lang' that
    is similar to what is needed here but is not sufficiently specific or
    flexible for the needs of this document.  In addition, 'lang' is not
    mentioned in <xref target="RFC3264"/>, and there are no known
    implementations in SIP.  Further, it is useful to be able to specify
    language per direction (sending and receiving).  This document therefore
    defines two new attributes.
    </t>

    </section>


    <section title="Solution">

    <t>
    An SDP attribute (per direction) seems the natural choice to negotiate
    human language of an interactive media stream, using the
    language tags of <xref target="BCP47"/>.
    </t>
    
    <section anchor="new" title="The 'hlang-send' and 'hlang-recv' Attributes">
    
    <t>
    This document defines two media-level attributes: 'hlang-send' and
    'hlang-recv' (registered in <xref target="IANA"/>). Both start with 'hlang',
    short for "human language".  These attributes are used to negotiate which human language is
    selected for use in (each direction of) each interactive media stream.  (Note that not all
    streams will necessarily be used.)
    Each can appear for media streams in offers and answers.
    </t>
        <t>
        In an offer, the 'hlang-send' value is a list of one or more
        language(s) the offerer is willing to use when sending using the
        media, and the 'hlang-recv' value is a list of one or more language(s)
        the offerer is willing to use when receiving using the media.  The
        list of languages is in preference order (first is most preferred).
       When a media is intended for interactive communication in only one direction
(e.g., a user in France with difficulty speaking but able to hear who
indicates a desire to receive French using audio and send French using text),
either 'hlang-send' or 'hlang-recv' MAY be omitted. Note
        that the media can still be useful in both directions.  When a media
        is not primarily intended for language (for example, a video or audio
        stream intended for background only), both SHOULD be omitted.
        Otherwise, both SHOULD have the same value.  Note that specifying
        different languages for each direction (as opposed to the same, or
        essentially the same, language in different modalities) can make it
        difficult to complete the call (e.g., specifying a desire to send
        audio in Hungarian and receive audio in Portuguese).
        </t>
        <t>
        In an answer, 'hlang-send' is the language the answerer will send if using the media for language (which in most cases is one of the languages in the offer's 'hlang-recv'), and 'hlang-recv' is the language the answerer expects to receive if using the media for language (which in most cases is one of the languages in the offer's 'hlang-send').
        </t>
        <t>
        In an offer, each value MUST be a list of one or more language tags
per <xref target="BCP47"/>, separated
by white space.  In an
answer, each value MUST be one language tag per <xref target="BCP47"/>.  <xref
target="BCP47"/>
describes mechanisms for matching language tags.  Note that Section
4.1 of RFC 5646 <xref target="BCP47"/> advises to "tag content wisely" and not include unnecessary subtags.
        </t>

        <t>
When placing an emergency call, and in any other case where the
language cannot be inferred from context, each OFFERed media stream
primarily intended for human language communication SHOULD specify
the 'hlang-send' and/or 'hlang-recv' attributes for the
direction(s) intended for interactive communication.
        </t>

        <t>
           Clients acting on behalf of end users are expected to set one or
   both of the 'hlang-send' and 'hlang-recv' attributes on each
   OFFERed media stream primarily intended for human communication
   when placing an outgoing session, and either ignore or take into
   consideration the attributes when receiving incoming calls, based
   on local configuration and capabilities.
        Systems acting on behalf of call centers and PSAPs
are expected to take the attributes into account when processing inbound calls.
        </t>
        
        <t>Note that media and language negotiation might result in more media streams being accepted than are needed by the users (e.g., if more preferred and less preferred combinations of media and language are all accepted).  This is not a problem.</t>
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="advisory" title="No Language in Common">
    <t>
    A consideration regarding the ability to negotiate language is whether the call
    proceeds or fails if the callee does not support any of the languages
    requested by the caller.  This document does not mandate either behavior.
    </t>
    <t>
    When a call is rejected due to lack of any language in common, the SIP
    response has SIP response code 488 (Not Acceptable Here) or 606 (Not
    Acceptable) <xref target="RFC3261"/> and a Warning header field <xref
    target="RFC3261"/> with a warning code of 308 and
    warning text indicating that there are no mutually supported languages;
    the warning text SHOULD also contain the supported languages and media.

    <section title="Usage Notes">

   <t>A sign-language tag with a video media stream is interpreted as an
   indication for sign language in the video stream.  A non-sign-language tag
   with a text media stream is interpreted as an indication for written
   language in the text stream.  A non-sign-language tag with an audio media
   stream is interpreted as an indication for spoken language in the audio
   stream.</t>

   <t>This document does not define any other use for language tags in
   video media (such as how to indicate visible captions in the video
   stream).</t>

   <t>This document does not define the use of sign-language tags in text
   or audio media.</t>

   <t>In the IANA registry for language subtags per <xref target="BCP47"/>, a
   language subtag with a Type field "extlang" combined with a Prefix
   field value "sgn" indicates a sign-language tag.  The absence of
   such "sgn" prefix indicates a non-sign-language tag.</t>

   <t>This document does not define the use of language tags in media
   other than interactive streams of audio, video, and text (such as
   "message" or "application").  Such use could be supported by future
   work or by application agreement.</t>

        <t>
        IANA has added the value 308 to the "Warning Codes
    (warn-codes)" sub-registry of the "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    Parameters" registry.  (The value lies within the 
    range allocated for indicating problems with keywords in the
    session description.)  The reference is to this document.  
    The warn text is "Incompatible language specification: Requested
    languages not supported.  Supported languages are [list of supported
    languages]; supported media are: [list of supported media]."</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
      The Security Considerations of <xref target="BCP47"/> apply
      here.     An attacker with the ability to modify signaling could prevent
      a call from succeeding by altering any of several crucial elements,
      including the 'hlang-send' or 'hlang-recv' values.  RFC 5069 <xref
      target="RFC5069"/> discusses such threats.  Use of 
      TLS or IPsec can protect against such threats.  Emergency
      calls are of particular concern; RFC 6881 <xref target="RFC6881"/>,
      which is specific to emergency calls, mandates use of TLS or IPsec (in
      ED-57/SP-30).
