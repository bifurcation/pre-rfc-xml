    <abstract>
      <t>The IETF has developed a one-way packet loss metric that measures the
      loss rate on a Poisson and Periodic probe streams between two hosts. However, the
      impact of packet loss on applications is, in general, sensitive not just
      to the average loss rate but also to the way in which packet losses are
      distributed in loss episodes (i.e., maximal sets of consecutively lost
      probe packets). This document defines one-way packet loss episode
      metrics, specifically, the frequency and average duration of loss
      episodes and a probing methodology under which the loss episode metrics
      are to be measured.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="Intro">
      <section title="Background and Motivation">
        <t></t>

        <t>Packet loss in the Internet is a complex phenomenon due to the
        bursty nature of traffic and congestion processes, influenced by both
        end-users and applications and the operation of transport protocols
        such as TCP. For these reasons, the simplest model of packet loss -- the
        single parameter Bernoulli (independent) loss model -- does not
        represent the complexity of packet loss over periods of time.
        Correspondingly, a single loss metric -- the average packet loss ratio
        over some period of time -- arising, e.g., from a stream of Poisson
        probes as in <xref target="RFC2680"></xref> is not sufficient to
        determine the effect of packet loss on traffic in general.</t>

        <t>Moving beyond single parameter loss models, Markovian and
        Markov-modulated loss models involving transitions between a good and
        bad state, each with an associated loss rate, have been proposed by
        Gilbert <xref target="Gilbert"></xref> and more generally by Elliot
        <xref target="Elliot"></xref>. In principle, Markovian models can be
        formulated over state spaces involving patterns of loss of any desired
        number of packets. However, further increase in the size of the state
        space makes such models cumbersome both for parameter estimation
        (accuracy decreases) and prediction in practice (due to computational
        complexity and sensitivity to parameter inaccuracy). In general, the
        relevance and importance of particular models can change in time, e.g.,
        in response to the advent of new applications and services. For this
        reason, we are drawn to empirical metrics that do not depend on a
        particular model for their interpretation.</t>

        <t>An empirical measure of packet loss complexity, the index of
        dispersion of counts (IDC), comprise, for each t &gt;0, the ratio v(t)
        / a(t) of the variance v(t) and average a(t) of the number of losses
        over successive measurement windows of a duration t. However, a full
        characterization of packet loss over time requires specification of
        the IDC for each window size t&gt;0.</t>

        <t>In the standards arena, loss pattern sample metrics are defined in
        <xref target="RFC3357"></xref>. Following the Gilbert-Elliot model,
        burst metrics specific for Voice over IP (VoIP) that characterize complete episodes of
        lost, transmitted, and discarded packets are defined in <xref
        target="RFC3611"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The above considerations motivate the formulation of empirical metrics of one-way packet loss that provide the simplest generalization of <xref target="RFC2680" /> (which is widely adopted but only defines a single loss-to-total ratio metric).  The metrics defined here capture deviations from independent packet loss in a robust model-independent manner.  The document also defines efficient measurement methodologies for these metrics.</t>

      <section title="Loss Episode Metrics and Bi-Packet Probes">
        <t></t>

        <t>The losses experienced by the packet stream can be viewed as
        occurring in loss episodes, i.e., a maximal set of consecutively lost
        packets. This memo describes one-way loss episode metrics: their
        frequency and average duration. Although the average loss ratio can be
        expressed in terms of these quantities, they go further in
        characterizing the statistics of the patterns of packet loss within
        the stream of probes. This is useful information in understanding the
        effect of packet losses on application performance, since different
        applications can have different sensitivities to patterns of loss,
        being sensitive not only to the long-term average loss rate, but how
        losses are distributed in time. As an example, MPEG video traffic may
        be sensitive to loss involving the I-frame in a group of pictures, but
        further losses within an episode of sufficiently short duration have
        no further impact; the damage is already done.</t>

        <t>The loss episode metrics presented here have the following useful
        properties:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>the metrics are empirical and do not depend on an underlying
            model; e.g., the loss process is not assumed to be Markovian. On
            the other hand, it turns out that the metrics of this memo can be
            related to the special case of the Gilbert Model parameters; see
            <xref target="app" />.</t>

            <t>the metric units can be directly compared with applications or
            user requirements or tolerance for network loss performance, in
            the frequency and duration of loss episodes, as well as the usual
            packet loss ratio, which can be recovered from the loss episode
            metrics upon dividing the average loss episode duration by the
            loss episode frequency.</t>

            <t>the metrics provide the smallest possible increment in
            complexity beyond, but in the spirit of, the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) average packet
            loss ratio metrics <xref target="RFC2680"></xref>, i.e., moving
            from a single metric (average packet loss ratio) to a pair of
            metrics (loss episode frequency and average loss episode
            duration).</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The document also describes a probing methodology under which loss
        episode metrics are to be measured. The methodology comprises sending
        probe packets in pairs, where packets within each probe pair have a
        fixed separation, and the time between pairs takes the form of a
        geometric distributed number multiplied by the same separation. This
        can be regarded a generalization of Poisson probing where the probes
        are pairs rather than single packets as in <xref
        target="RFC2680"></xref>, and also of geometric probing described in
        <xref target="RFC2330"></xref>. However, it should be distinguished
        from back-to-back packet pairs whose change in separation on
        traversing a link is used to probe bandwidth. In this document, the
        separation between the packets in a pair is the temporal resolution at
        which different loss episodes are to be distinguished. The methodology
        does not measure episodes of loss of consecutive background packets on
        the measured path. One key feature of this methodology is its
        efficiency: it estimates the average length of loss episodes without
        directly measuring the complete episodes themselves. Instead, this
        information is encoded in the observed relative frequencies of the four
        possible outcomes arising from the loss or successful transmission of
        each of the two packets of the probe pairs. This is distinct from the
        approach of <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>, which reports on directly
        measured episodes.</t>

        <t>The metrics defined in this memo are "derived metrics", according
        to Section 6.1 of <xref target="RFC2330"></xref> (the IPPM framework).
        They are based on the singleton loss metric defined in Section 2 of
        <xref target="RFC2680"></xref> .</t>

        wish to select a substream from it for the purposes of loss episode
        measurement. Packet pairs selected as bi-packet loss probes need not
        be consecutive within such a stream. In the next section, we specialize

      spaced times T1 &lt; T2 &lt; ... &lt; Tn. Each time Ti is potentially
      the first packet time for a packet pair measurement. We make an
      independent random decision at each time, whether to initiate such a
      measurement. Hence, the interval count between successive times at which
      a pair is initiated follows a geometric distribution. We also specify
      that the spacing between successive times Ti is the same as the spacing
      between packets in a given pair. Thus, if pairs happen to be launched at
      the successive times Ti and T(i+1), the second packet of the first pair is
      actually used as the first packet of the second pair.</t>

    <section title="Loss Episode Proto-Metrics">
      <t></t>

      <t>This section describes four generic proto-metric quantities
      associated with an arbitrary set of Loss Pairs. These are the
      Loss-Pair-Counts, Bi-Packet-Loss-Ratio,
      Bi-Packet-Loss-Episode-Duration-Number,
      Bi-Packet-Loss-Episode-Frequency-Number. Specific loss episode metrics
      can then be constructed when these proto-metrics take, as their input,
      sets of Loss Pairs samples generated by the
      Type-P-One-way-Bi-Packet-Loss-Stream and
      Type-P-One-way-Bi-Packet-Loss-Geometric-Stream. The second of these is
      described in <xref target="TPOWBPLGS"></xref>. It is not expected that
      these proto-metrics would be reported themselves. Rather, they are
      intermediate quantities in the production of the final metrics of
      <xref target="Loss" /> below, and could be rolled up into metrics in implementations.
      The metrics report loss episode durations and frequencies in terms of
      packet counts, since they do not depend on the actual time between probe
      packets. The final metrics of <xref target="Loss" /> incorporate timescales and yield
      durations in seconds and frequencies as per second.</t>

    <section title="Loss Episode Metrics Derived from Bi-Packet Loss Probing" anchor="Loss">
      <t>Metrics for the time frequency and time duration of loss episodes are
      now defined as functions of the set of n Loss Pairs L1,....,Ln. Although a
      loss episode is defined as a maximal set of successive lost packets, the
      loss episode metrics are not defined directly in terms of the sequential
      patterns of packet loss exhibited by Loss Pairs. This is because
      samples, including Type-P-One-way-Bi-Packet-Loss-Geometric-Stream,
      generally do not report all lost packets in each episode. Instead, the
      metrics are defined as functions of the Loss-Pair-Counts of the sample,
      for reasons that are now described.</t>

      <t>Consider an idealized Type-P-One-way-Bi-Packet-Loss-Geometric-Stream
      sample in which the launch probability q =1. It is shown in <xref
      target="SBDR08"></xref> that the average number of packets in a loss
      episode of this ideal sample is exactly the
      Bi-Packet-Loss-Episode-Duration derived from its set of Loss Pairs. Note
      this computation makes no reference to the position of lost packet in
      the sequence of probes.</t>

      <t>A general Type-P-One-way-Bi-Packet-Loss-Geometric-Stream sample with
      launch probability q &lt; 1, independently samples, with probability q,
      each Loss Pair of an idealized sample. On average, the Loss-Pair-Counts
      (if normalized by the total number of pairs) will be the same as in the
      idealized sample. The loss episode metrics in the general case are thus
      estimators of those for the idealized case; the statistical properties
      of this estimation, including a derivation of the estimation variance,
      is provided in <xref target="SBDR08"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="Relation to Gilbert Model">
        <t>The general Gilbert-Elliot model is a discrete time Markov chain
        over two states, Good (g) and Bad (b), each with its own independent
        packet loss ratio. In the simplest case, the Good loss ratio is 0, while
        the Bad loss ratio is 1. Correspondingly, there are two independent
        parameters, the Markov transition probabilities P(g|b) = 1- P(b|b) and
        P(b|g) = 1- P(g|g), where P(i|j) is the probability to transition from
        state j and step n to state i at step n+1. With these parameters, the
        fraction of steps spent in the bad state is P(b|g)/(P(b|g) + P(g|b)),
        while the average duration of a sojourn in the bad state is 1/P(g|b)
        steps.</t>

        <t>Now identify the steps of the Markov chain with the possible
        sending times of packets for a
        Type-P-One-way-Bi-Packet-Loss-Geometric-Stream with launch spacing d.
        Suppose the loss episode metrics
        Type-P-One-way-Bi-Packet-Loss-Geometric-Stream-Ratio and
        Type-P-One-way-Bi-Packet-Loss-Geometric-Stream-Episode-Duration take
        the values r and m, respectively. Then, from the discussion in <xref target="Discussion" />, the following can be equated:</t>

        <t>r = P(b|g)/(P(b|g) + P(g|b)) and m/d = 1/P(g|b).</t>

        <t>These relationships can be inverted in order to recover the Gilbert
        model parameters:</t>

        <t>P(g|b) = d/m and P(b|g)=d/m/(1/r - 1)</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Conducting Internet measurements raises both security and privacy
      concerns. This memo does not specify an implementation of the metrics,
      so it does not directly affect the security of the Internet or of
      applications that run on the Internet. However,implementations of these
      metrics must be mindful of security and privacy concerns.</t>

      <t>There are two types of security concerns: potential harm caused by
      the measurements and potential harm to the measurements. The
      measurements could cause harm because they are active and inject
      packets into the network. The measurement parameters MUST be carefully
      selected so that the measurements inject trivial amounts of additional
      traffic into the networks they measure. If they inject "too much"
      traffic, they can skew the results of the measurement and, in extreme
      cases, cause congestion and denial of service. The measurements
      themselves could be harmed by routers giving measurement traffic a
      different priority than "normal" traffic, or by an attacker injecting
      artificial measurement traffic. If routers can recognize measurement
      traffic and treat it separately, the measurements may not reflect actual
      user traffic. If an attacker injects artificial traffic that is accepted
      as legitimate, the loss rate will be artificially lowered. Therefore,
      the measurement methodologies SHOULD include appropriate techniques to
      reduce the probability that measurement traffic can be distinguished
      from "normal" traffic. Authentication techniques, such as digital
      signatures, may be used where appropriate to guard against injected
      traffic attacks. The privacy concerns of network measurement are limited
      by the active measurements described in this memo: they involve no
      release of user data.</t>
