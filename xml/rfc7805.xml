		<abstract>
			<t>This document reclassifies several TCP extensions and
			TCP-related documents that either have been superseded, have never seen
			widespread use, or are no longer recommended for use to "Historic" status.
			The affected documents are RFCs 675, 721, 761, 813,
			816, 879, 896, 1078, and 6013. Additionally, this document
			reclassifies RFCs 700, 794, 814, 817, 872, 889,
			964, and 1071 to "Informational" status.</t>
		</abstract>
	</front>

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>TCP has a long history. Over time, many RFCs have accumulated
			that describe aspects of the TCP protocol, implementation, and
			extensions. Some of these have been superseded, are no longer
			recommended for use, or have simply never seen widespread use.</t>

			<t>Sections 6 and 7.1  of the TCP roadmap document <xref
			target="RFC7414"/> already reclassified a number of TCP extensions as
			"Historic" and describes the reasons for doing so, but it did not
			instruct the RFC Editor to change the status of these RFCs in the
			RFC database. The purpose of this document is to do just that.</t>

			<t>In addition,
			this document reclassifies all other documents mentioned in the TCP roadmap
			that currently have an "Unknown" status to either "Historic" or
			"Informational".</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Status Changes">
			<t>The following two sections give a short justification why a
			specific TCP extension or a TCP-related document is being reclassified as
			"Historic" or "Informational". In addition, the letter code after an RFC
			number indicates from which original status a particular
			RFC is changed to "Historic" or "Informational" (see BCP 9 <xref
				target="RFC2026"/> for an explanation of these categories):
				<list style="empty">
					<t>S - Standards Track (Proposed Standard, Draft Standard,
					or Internet Standard)</t>
					<t>E - Experimental</t>
					<t>I - Informational</t>
					<t>H - Historic</t>
					<t>B - Best Current Practice</t>
					<t>U - Unknown (not formally defined)</t>
				</list>
			For the content of the documents itself, the reader is referred
			either to the corresponding RFC or, for a brief description, to the
			TCP roadmap document <xref target="RFC7414"/>.</t>

			<section title="Moving to &quot;Historic&quot; Status">
				<t>This document changes the status of the
				following RFCs to "Historic" <xref target="RFC2026"/>:

					<list style="symbols">
						<t><xref
						target="RFC0675"/> U, "Specification of Internet
						Transmission Control Program" was replaced by the final
						TCP specification <xref target="RFC0793"/></t>

						<t><xref target="RFC0721"/> U, "Out-of-Band Control Signals in a
						Host-to-Host Protocol" was a proposal that was not
						incorporated into the final TCP
						specification <xref target="RFC0793"/></t>

						<t><xref target="RFC0761"/> U, "DoD Standard Transmission Control
						Protocol" was
						replaced by the final TCP specification <xref
							target="RFC0793"/></t>

						<t><xref target="RFC0813"/> U, "Window and Acknowledgement Strategy
						in TCP" was
						incorporated into <xref
							target="RFC1122"/></t>

						<t><xref target="RFC0816"/> U, "Fault Isolation and Recovery"
						was incorporated
						into <xref target="RFC1122"/> and <xref target="RFC5461"/></t>

						<t><xref target="RFC0879"/> U, "The TCP Maximum Segment Size and
						Related Topics" was
						incorporated into <xref
							target="RFC1122"/> and <xref
							target="RFC6691"/></t>

						<t><xref target="RFC0896"/> U, "Congestion Control in IP/TCP
						Internetworks" was
						incorporated into <xref
							target="RFC1122"/> and <xref
							target="RFC6633"/></t>

						<t><xref target="RFC1078"/> U, "TCP Port Service Multiplexer
						(TCPMUX)" should be deprecated, because:
							<list style="symbols">
							<?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
								<t>It modifies the TCP connection establishment semantics by also completing the three-way handshake when a service is not available.</t>
								<t>It requires all new connections to be received on a single port, which limits the number of connections between two machines.</t>
								<t>It complicates firewall implementation and management because all services share the
									same port number.</t>
<!--Note: the following change (per the authors) requires AD approval:

OLD:
 * There are no known client-side deployments.

NEW:
*  There are very limited deployments, and 
   these are not used in an Internet context.  
   (The only reported use is for SGI's Data 
   Migration Facility in private networks.)

								<t>There are very limited deployments, and these are not used in an Internet context. (The only reported use is for SGI's Data Migration Facility in private networks.)</t>
							<?rfc subcompact="no"?>
							</list>
						</t>

						<t><xref target="RFC6013"/> E, "TCP Cookie Transactions
						(TCPCT)" should be deprecated (although only published in 2011) because:
							<list style="symbols">
							<?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
								<t>It uses the experimental TCP option
								codepoints, which prohibit a large-scale
								deployment.</t>
								<t><xref target="RFC7413"/> and <xref

						experiments with the TCP
						retransmission timeout calculation</t>

						<t><xref target="RFC0964"/> U, "Some Problems with the Specification
						of the Military Standard Transmission Control
						Protocol", which
						points out several specification bugs in the US
						Military's MIL-STD-1778 document, which was intended as
						a successor to <xref target="RFC0793"/></t>

						<t><xref target="RFC1071"/> U, "Computing the Internet
