      <t>
        When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of
	object identifiers was donated by DigiCert, Inc. for the purpose of
	registering the Edwards Elliptic Curve key agreement and signature
	algorithms. This donated set of OIDs allowed for shorter values than
	would be possible using the existing S/MIME or PKIX arcs. This
	document describes the donated range and the identifiers that were
	assigned from that range, transfers control of that range to IANA, and
	establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments within
	that range.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of
	object identifiers was donated to the working group by DigiCert, Inc.
        The use of these object identifiers  allowed for the Edwards Elliptic
	Curve key agreement <xref target="RFC7748"/> and signature <xref
	target="RFC8032"/> algorithms to be defined with encodings that are
	smaller than similar ones would be if assigned from the  existing
	S/MIME or PKIX arcs. 
        The initial registrations from this arc were made while developing
	<xref target="RFC8410"/>. 
        After those registrations were made, there were still some unused
	values that could be used by other security groups. 
      </t>
      
      <t>
        Object identifiers are primarily used with Abstract Syntax Notation (ASN.1) <xref target="ASN.1"/>.
        The ASN.1 specifications continue to evolve, but object identifiers can be used with any and all versions of ASN.1.
      </t>

      <t>
        This document describes the object identifiers that were assigned in that donated range, transfers control of the range to IANA, and establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        The donated range from DigiCert, Inc. is as follows:
        <figure>
          <artwork>
first: { iso (1) identified-organization (3) thawte (101) 100 }
last: { iso (1) identified-organization (3) thawte (101) 127 }
          </artwork>
        </figure>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
        IANA has created the "SMI Security for Cryptographic Algorithms" registry
	within the SMI-numbers registry.  The new registry has three columns,
	as shown below. </t>

	 </texttable>

<t>The registration policy is "Specification Required" as defined in <xref target="RFC8126"/>. </t>

	 <t>
	   The column 'Decimal' is required to be a number between 100 and 127 inclusive.
	 </t>

	 <t>
	   The value of 100 has been reserved so that a new arc below that
	   point can be established in the future (i.e., starting at
	   1.3.101.100.1). If the new child registry is established, a name for this value is to be assigned at that point.
	   The experts can, at their discretion, assign an algorithm OID instead.
	 </t>

     </section>
     <section title="Security Considerations">
       <t>
	 This document populates an IANA registry, and it raises no new security considerations.
	 The protocols that specify these values include the security considerations associated with their usage.

      <t>
        Our thanks go out to DigiCert for donating the range of OIDs covered
	in this document. At the time of the donation, the root of the range
	was assigned to Symantec but has since been transferred to DigiCert.
