        <abstract><t>Several MIME type/subtype combinations exist that can contain different media formats.  A receiving agent thus needs to examine the details of such media content to determine if the specific elements can be rendered given an available set of codecs.  Especially when the end system has limited resources, or the connection to the end system has limited bandwidth, it is helpful to know from the Content-Type alone if the content can be rendered.
        </t><t>This document specifies two parameters, 'codecs' and 'profiles', that are used with various MIME types or type/subtype combinations to allow for unambiguous specification of the codecs employed by the media formats contained within, or the profile(s) of the overall container format. This document obsoletes RFC 4281; RFC 4281 defines the 'codecs' parameter, which this document retains in a backwards compatible manner with minor clarifications; the 'profiles' parameter is added by this document.
        </t><t>By labeling content with the specific codecs indicated to render the contained media, receiving systems can determine if the codecs are supported by the end system, and if not, can take appropriate action (such as rejecting the content, sending notification of the situation, transcoding the content to a supported type, fetching and installing the required codecs, further inspection to determine if it will be sufficient to support a subset of the indicated codecs, etc.).</t>
        <t>Similarly, the profiles can provide an overall indication, to the receiver, of the specifications with which the content complies. This is an indication of the compatibility of the container format and its contents to some specification. The receiver may be able to work out the extent to which it can handle and render the content by examining to see which of the declared profiles it supports, and what they mean.</t>
        </abstract>

<section anchor="sec-1" title="Introduction">
<t>
   One of the original motivations for MIME is the ability to identify
   the specific media type of a message part.  However, due to various
   factors, it is not always possible from looking at the MIME type and
   subtype to know which specific media formats are contained in the
   body part or which codecs are indicated in order to render the
   content.
</t><t>
   There are several media type/subtypes (either currently registered or
   deployed with registration pending) that contain codecs chosen from a
   set.  In the absence of the parameters described here, it is necessary to examine each media element in
   order to determine the codecs or other features required to render the content.  For
   example, video/3gpp may contain any of the video formats H.263
   Profile 0, H.263 Profile 3, H.264, MPEG-4 Simple Profile, and/or any
   of the audio formats Adaptive Multi Rate (AMR), Adaptive Multi Rate -
   WideBand (AMR-WB), Extended AMR-WB, Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), or
   Enhanced aacPlus, as specified in <xref target="3GPP-Formats" />.
</t><t>
   In some cases, the specific codecs can be determined by examining the
   header information of the media content.  While this isn't as bad as
   examining the entire content, it still requires specialized knowledge
   of each format and is resource consumptive.
</t><t>
   This ambiguity can be a problem for various clients and servers.  For example, it presents a significant burden to Multimedia Messaging (MMS) servers,
   which must examine the media sent in each message in order to
   determine which codecs are required to render the content.  Only then
   can such a server determine if the content requires transcoding or
   specialized handling prior to being transmitted to the handset.
</t><t>
   Additionally, it presents a challenge to smart clients on devices
   with constrained memory, processing power, or transmission bandwidth
   (such as cellular telephones and PDAs).  Such clients often need to
   determine in advance if they are currently capable of rendering the
   content contained in an MMS or email message.
</t><t>
   Ambiguity:
</t><t>

<list style="symbols">
       <t>audio/3gpp can contain AMR, AAC, AMR-WB, Extended AMR-WB, or Enhanced aacPlus contents as specified in <xref target="3GPP-Formats" />.</t>
       <t>audio/3gpp2 can contain AMR, AAC, 13K (as per <xref target="RFC3625" />), Enhanced Variable Rate Codec (EVRC), Selectable Mode Vocoder (SMV),
       or Variable Multi Rate WideBand (VMR-WB), as specified in <xref target="3GPP2-Formats" />.</t>
       <t>video/3gpp can contain H.263 Profile 0, H.263 Profile 3, H.264, MPEG-4 Simple Profile, and/or AMR, AMR-WB, Extended AMR-WB, AAC,
       or Enhanced aacPlus, as specified in <xref target="3GPP-Formats" />.</t>
       <t>video/3gpp2 can contain H.263 Profile 0, H.263 Profile 3, H.264, MPEG-4 Simple Profile, and/or AMR, AAC, 13K (as per <xref target="RFC3625" />), EVRC, SMV, or VMR-WB, as specified in <xref target="3GPP2-Formats" />.</t>
       <t>audio/mp4 can include any codec defined in MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 or registered at the <xref target="MP4RA">MP4
       registration authority</xref>.</t>
       <t>video/mp4 has the same issues as audio/mp4, and in addition many video codecs, and especially the MPEG codecs, have a variety of profiles and levels, not all of which are supported by every implementation.</t>
       </list>
</t><t>
   Note that there are additional media types that are ambiguous, but
   are outside the scope of this document, including:
</t><t><list style="symbols">
       <t>video/mpeg4-generic, which can contain anything allowed by the MPEG-4 specification, or any codec registered with the <xref target="MP4RA">MP4
       registration authority</xref>;</t>
       </list>
</t><t>
   With each &quot;bucket&quot; type, a receiving agent only knows that it has a
   container format.  It doesn't even know whether content that is labeled
   video/3gpp or video/3gpp2 contains video; it might be audio only,
   audio and video, or video only.
</t><t>
   A solution that permits a receiving agent to determine the specific
   codecs or profiles required to render media content would help provide efficient
   and scalable servers, especially for Multimedia Messaging (MMS), and
   aid the growth of multimedia services in wireless networks.

<section anchor="sec-3" title="The &apos;Codecs&apos; Parameter">
<section anchor="sec-3.1" title="Introduction">
<t>
   This section adds a parameter to allow unambiguous specification of
   all codecs indicated to render the content in the MIME part.  This
   parameter is optional in all current types to which it is added.
   Future types that contain ambiguity are strongly encouraged to
   include this parameter.</t>
  <t>This parameter applies to:
  <list style='numbers'>
  	<t>Files in the family based on the ISO Base Media File Format <xref target="ISO14496-12" /> called "ISO family files" in this specification.</t>
  	<t>The QuickTime file format, owned by Apple, Inc.</t>
  </list></t>
<t>This includes the media types:
   <list style='numbers'>
   	<t>audio/3gpp, video/3gpp <xref target="RFC3839" /></t>
   	<t>audio/3gpp2, video/3gpp2 <xref target="RFC4393" /></t>
   	<t>audio/mp4, video/mp4, application/mp4 <xref target="RFC4337" /></t>
   	<t>video/quicktime</t>
   	<t>application/mp21 (see note below)</t>
   </list></t>
   <t>Note that MPEG-21 files under the type application/mp21 may, but are not required to, contain a top-level 'moov' atom providing a timed, coded, resource. The 'codecs' parameter SHOULD only be used for MPEG-21 files when this timed material is also present in the file.</t>
<t>
   Parameter name:
       codecs
</t><t>
   Parameter value: A single value, or a comma-separated list of values
        identifying the codec(s) indicated to render the content in the
        body part.
</t><t>
        Each value consists of one or more dot-separated elements.  The
        name space for the first element is determined by the MIME type.
        The name space for each subsequent element is determined by the
        preceding element. The precise syntax is given below in the <xref target="sec-3.2">Generic Syntax</xref>.
</t><t>
        Note that, per <xref target="RFC2045" />, some characters (including the
        comma used to separate multiple values) require that the entire
        parameter value be enclosed in quotes.
</t><t>

        An element MAY include an octet that <xref target="RFC2045" /> requires encoding.  In this case, <xref target="RFC2231" /> is used:
        an asterisk (&quot;*&quot;) is placed at the end of the parameter name
        (becoming &apos;codecs*&apos; instead of &apos;codecs&apos;), the parameter value
        usually starts with two single quote (&quot;'&quot;) characters
        (indicating that neither character set nor language is
        specified), and each octet that requires encoding is represented
        as a percent sign (&quot;%&quot;) followed by two hexadecimal digits.
        Note that, when the <xref target="RFC2231" /> form is used, the percent
        sign, asterisk, and single quote characters have special meaning
        and so MUST themselves be percent encoded.
</t><t><figure><artwork>
        Examples of Generic Syntax:
            codecs=a.bb.ccc.d
            codecs=&quot;a.bb.ccc.d, e.fff&quot;
            codecs*=''fo%2e
            codecs*=&quot;''%25%20xz, gork&quot;
</artwork></figure></t><t>
   When the 'codecs' parameter is used, it MUST contain all codecs
   indicated by the content present in the body part.  The 'codecs'
   parameter MUST NOT include any codecs that are not indicated by any
   media elements in the body part.
</t><t>
   In some cases, not all indicated codecs are absolutely required in
   order to render the content.  Therefore, when a receiver does not
   support all listed codecs, special handling might be required.  For
   example, the media element(s) could be examined in order to
   determine if an unsupported codec is actually required (e.g., there
   may be alternative tracks (such as English and Spanish audio), there
   may be timed text that can be dropped, etc.).
</t><t>
   Although the encoder MUST create parameter values that are complete and accurate in 'breadth' (that is, the encoder MUST report all four-character codes used in all tracks for ISO family files, for example) receivers MUST NOT rely on the parameter values being complete in 'depth'.  (If the hierarchical rules for a given code (e.g., 'qvxy') were written after a server was implemented, for example, that server would not know what elements to place after 'qvxy').
</t><t>
   Although a mismatch is not permitted by this specification, the body part is definitive of the actual codecs needed; the parameter supplied here is informative. If a receiver encounters a body part whose 'codecs' parameter contains codecs that are not indicated by any media elements, then the receiver SHOULD process the body part by discarding the information in the 'codecs' parameter.
</t><t>
   If a receiver encounters a body part whose 'codecs' parameter does not
   contain all codecs indicated by the media elements, then the receiver
   MAY process the body part by discarding the information in the 'codecs'
   parameter.
</t></section>
<section anchor="sec-3.2" title="Generic Syntax">
<t>
   The 'codecs' parameter takes either of two forms.  The first form is
   used when the value does not contain any octets that require
   encoding.  The second form uses <xref target="RFC2231" />
 to allow arbitrary
   octets to be encoded.  With either form, quotes allow for commas and
   other characters in &lt;tspecials&gt; (quotes MAY be used even when not
   required).
</t><t>
   This BNF uses the rules specified in <xref target="RFC2045" />
 and <xref target="RFC2231" />.
</t><t>
  While <xref target="RFC2231" /> allows specification of character set and language, this parameter does not contain items intended for human consumption, and hence makes no use of language.  The language element SHOULD be omitted; the character set SHOULD also be omitted.  A receiver MAY ignore language and MAY choose to support only <xref target="RFC1345">US-ASCII</xref> and <xref target="RFC3629">UTF-8</xref>.
</t><t>
   Implementations MUST NOT add comments and/or folding white space (CFWS) between the tokens except after
   &quot;,&quot;. TOKEN is defined in <xref target="RFC2045" />, and &lt;ext-octet&gt; and &lt;attribute-char&gt; are defined in <xref target="RFC2231" />.</t>
   <t>The BNF syntax is as follows:</t>

<t>
   Initial name space: This document only defines values for files in
   the ISO Base Media File Format and QuickTime families.  Other file formats may also
   define codec naming.
</t>
</section>
<section anchor="sec-3.3" title="ISO Base Media File Format Name Space">
<t>
   For the ISO Base Media File Format, and the QuickTime movie file format, the first element of a 'codecs'
   parameter value is a sample description entry four-character code as
   registered by the MP4 Registration Authority <xref target="MP4RA" />.  Values are
   case sensitive.
</t><t>
   Note that there are potentially multiple tracks in a file, each
   potentially carrying multiple sample entries (some but not all uses
   of the ISO Base Media File Format restrict the number of sample entries in a
   track to one).
</t><t>
   When the first element of a value is 'mp4a' (indicating some kind of
   MPEG-4 audio), or 'mp4v' (indicating some kind of MPEG-4 part-2
   video), or 'mp4s' (indicating some kind of MPEG-4 Systems streams such as MPEG-4 BInary Format for Scenes (BIFS)), the second element is the hexadecimal representation of the
   MP4 Registration Authority ObjectTypeIndication (OTI), as specified
   in <xref target="MP4RA" /> and <xref target="MP41" /> (including amendments).  Note that <xref target="MP4RA" />
   uses a leading &quot;0x&quot; with these values, which is omitted here and
   hence implied.
</t><t>
   One of the OTI values for 'mp4a' is 40 (identifying MPEG-4 audio).
   For this value, the third element identifies the audio
   ObjectTypeIndication (OTI) as defined in <xref target="MP4A" /> (including
   amendments), expressed as a decimal number.
</t><t>
   For example, AAC low complexity (AAC-LC) has the value 2, so a complete
   string for AAC-LC would be &quot;mp4a.40.2&quot;.
</t><t>
   One of the OTI values for 'mp4v' is 20 (identifying MPEG-4 part-2
   video).  For this value, the third element identifies the video
   ProfileLevelIndication as defined in <xref target="MP4V" /> (including amendments),
   expressed as a decimal number.
</t><t>
   For example, MPEG-4 Visual Simple Profile Level 0 has the value 9,
   so a complete string for MPEG-4 Visual Simple Profile Level 0 would
   be &quot;mp4v.20.9&quot;.
</t><t>
	When the first element of a value is a code indicating a codec from the Advanced Video Coding specification <xref target="AVC" />, specifically one of the sample entries defined in <xref target="AVC-Formats" /> (such as 'avc1', 'avc2', 'svc1', 'mvc1' and 'mvc2') -- indicating AVC (H.264), Scalable Video Coding (SVC), or Multiview Video Coding (MVC), the second element (referred to as 'avcoti' in the formal syntax) is the hexadecimal representation of the following three bytes in the (subset) sequence parameter set Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) unit specified in <xref target="AVC" />:</t> 
	<t><list style="format (%d)">
	<t>profile_idc, </t>
	<t>the byte containing the constraint_set flags (currently constraint_set0_flag through constraint_set5_flag, and the reserved_zero_2bits), and</t>
	<t>level_idc. </t>
	</list></t>
	<t>Note that the sample entries 'avc1' and 'avc2' do not necessarily indicate that the media only contains AVC NAL units. In fact, the media may be encoded as an SVC or MVC profile and thus contain SVC or MVC NAL units. In order to be able to determine which codec is used, further information is necessary (profile_idc). Note also that reserved_zero_2bits is required to be equal to 0 in <xref target="AVC" />, but other values for it may be specified in the future by ITU-T or ISO/IEC.</t><t>
   This is as previously defined in the 3GPP File Format specification <xref target="3GPP-Formats">3GPP TS 26.244</xref>, Section A.2.2. </t>
   <t>When SVC or MVC content is coded in an AVC-compatible fashion, the sample description may include both an AVC configuration record and an SVC or MVC configuration record. Under those circumstances, it is recommended that the two configuration records both be reported as they may contain different AVC profile, level, and compatibility indicator values. Thus, the codecs reported would include the sample description code (e.g., 'avc1') twice, with the values from one of the configuration records forming the 'avcoti' information in each.</t>

   sufficient, all that needs to be done is to update the media type
   registration to specify the 'codecs' parameter with a reference to this
   document.  For existing media types, it is generally advisable for
   the parameter to be optional; for new media types, the parameter MAY
   be optional or required, as appropriate.
</t><t>
   For ISO family file formats where the name space as defined here needs to be
   expanded, a new document MAY update this one by specifying the
   additional detail.
</t><t>
   For non-ISO family file formats, a new document MAY update this one by specifying
   the name space for the media type(s).

<section anchor="sec-6" title="Additional Media Feature Details">
<t>
   It is sometimes helpful to provide additional details for a media
   element (e.g., the number of X and Y pixels, the color depth, etc.).
   These details are sometimes called &quot;media features&quot; or &quot;media
   characteristics&quot;.
</t><t>
   When such additional features are included, the content-features <xref target="RFC2912" /> header provides a handy way to do so.

<section anchor="sec-7" title="The &apos;Profiles&apos; Parameter">
  <section title="Introduction">
  <t>Just as some codecs have a variety of profiles (subsets of their functionality within which a bitstream can be coded), some media files can also be profiled and be associated with one or more profile identifiers of the profiles to which they conform. These profiles can indicate features of the file format itself, which codecs may be present, the profiles of those codecs, and so on. It can be advantageous to a receiving system to know the overall file profile(s) of a file; indeed, under these circumstances it may not be necessary to know the codecs themselves if they are implied by the profile.</t>
  <t>The 'profiles' parameter reports on the profile(s) of the overall container format. A profile of the container format may have restrictions on not only the features of the container format itself but also on what codecs may be included, and it may indeed have restrictions on the profiles of those codecs. The 'profiles' parameter does not, however, report directly any profiles of the contained media: when such codec-specific profiles are reported, this report is part of the 'codecs' parameter. The 'profiles' parameter reports only the profile(s) applying to the complete container.</t>
  <t>When the use of the 'profiles' parameter is defined for a given format, that definition SHOULD indicate that it directly reflects information in the body part, i.e., that it does not convey information beyond, or different from, what can be learnt by inspecting the body part. Although a mismatch is not permitted by this specification, the body part is definitive of the actual profiles; the parameter supplied here is informative.</t>
  </section>
  <section title="Formal Declaration">
<t>
   This section adds a parameter to allow unambiguous specification of
   the profiles to which a file claims conformance.  This
   parameter is OPTIONAL in all current types to which it is added.</t>
  <t>This parameter applies to Box-structured (also known as atom-structured) files that have an initial box containing compatibility brands, as registered at the <xref target="MP4RA">MP4 Registration Authority</xref>, such as a filetype or segment-type box. Principally, this includes files in the family based on the <xref target="ISO14496-12">ISO Base Media File Format</xref> and the QuickTime file format, owned by Apple, Inc. (A brand can indicate conformance with restrictions regarding which codecs and file format features are used, adherence to quantitative limits such as the length/size of the file, and so on.)
</t>
<t>This includes the media types:
   <list style='numbers'>
	<t>audio/3gpp, video/3gpp <xref target="RFC3839" /></t>
   	<t>audio/3gpp2, video/3gpp2 <xref target="RFC4393" /></t>
   	<t>audio/mp4, video/mp4 <xref target="RFC4337" /></t>
   	<t>video/quicktime</t>
   	<t>application/mp21</t>
   </list></t>
<t>
   Parameter name:
       profiles
</t><t>
   Parameter value: A single value, or a comma-separated list of values
        identifying the profiles(s) to which the file claims conformance.
</t><t>
        The name space is determined by the MIME type.
</t><t>
        Note that, per <xref target="RFC2045" />, some characters (including the
        comma used to separate multiple values) require that the entire
        parameter value be enclosed in quotes.
</t><t>
        An element MAY include an octet that <xref target="RFC2045" /> requires encoding.  In this case, <xref target="RFC2231" /> is used:
        an asterisk (&quot;*&quot;) is placed at the end of the parameter name
        (becoming &apos;profiles*&apos; instead of &apos;profiles&apos;), the parameter value usually starts with two single quote (&quot;'&quot;) characters(indicating that neither character set nor language is
        specified), and each octet that requires encoding is represented
        as a percent sign (&quot;%&quot;) followed by two hexadecimal digits.
        Note that, when the <xref target="RFC2231" /> form is used, the percent
        sign, asterisk, and single quote characters have special meaning
        and so MUST themselves be percent encoded.
</t><t><figure><artwork>
        Examples of Generic Syntax:
            profiles=&quot;isom,mp41,qvXt&quot;
            profiles*=&quot;''%25%20xz, gork&quot;
</artwork></figure></t>
</section>
  <section title="&apos;Profiles&apos; Parameter Definition">
  <t>The 'profiles' parameter is an OPTIONAL parameter that indicates one or more profiles to which the file claims conformance. Like the 'codecs' parameter described above, it may occur as either 'profiles' or 'profiles*', with the same encoding rules. The value is, as for the 'codecs' parameter, a comma-separated list of profile identifiers. </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Profiles for Files Carrying MP4RA-Registered Brands">
  <t>For any file format carrying a brand registered at the <xref target="MP4RA">MP4 Registration Authority</xref>, notably files based on the ISO Base Media File Format <xref target="ISO14496-12">ISO/IEC 14496-12</xref> and QuickTime movie files, the 'profiles' parameter MUST list exactly the major-brand, followed by the compatible-brands, as listed in the filetype box ('ftyp') or segment-type box ('styp'). The major-brand MUST be first, and MAY be removed from the compatible-brands list. (The file format requires that it be repeated in the compatible-brands, but this requirement is relaxed here for compactness.)</t>
  <t>An example might be profiles="mp41,isom,qvXt", indicating that MPEG-4 version 1 is the major-brand and preferred use, that the file is compatible with the version of the base file format identified by 'isom', and that it is also compatible with the specification/profile 'qvXt' (whatever that may be).</t>

<section anchor="sec-8" title="IANA Considerations">
   <t>IANA has replaced references to <xref target="RFC4281"/> with references to this document in the  &quot;MIME Media Types&quot; registry, thereby indicating that the &apos;codecs&apos; and/or &apos;profiles&apos; parameters are optional for the following media types (as listed in Sections 3 and 4):
   <list style='numbers'>
   	<t>audio/3gpp, video/3gpp <xref target="RFC3839" /></t>
   	<t>audio/3gpp2, video/3gpp2 <xref target="RFC4393" /></t>
   	<t>audio/mp4, video/mp4, application/mp4 <xref target="RFC4337" /></t>
   	<t>video/quicktime</t>
   	<t>application/mp21</t>
   </list>
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="sec-9" title="Registration">
<t>
   The MPEG4 Registration Authority can be consulted for the most up-to-date registration of sub-parameters for the codecs type, for specific codecs.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="sec-10" title="Security Considerations">
<t>
   The 'codecs' parameter itself does not alter the security considerations of any of the media types with which it is used.  Each audio and video media type has its own set of security considerations that continue to apply, regardless of the use of the 'codecs' parameter.
</t><t>
   An incorrect 'codecs' parameter might cause media content to be received by a device that is not capable of rendering it or might cause media content not to be sent to a device that is capable of receiving it.  An incorrect 'codecs' parameter is therefore capable of some types of denial-of-service attacks.  However, this is most likely to arise by accident, as an attacker capable of altering media data in transit could cause more harm by altering the media format itself, or even the content type header, rather than just the 'codecs' parameter of the content type header.
</t><t>
  To the extent that a receiver reacts to a 'codecs' parameter that indicates an unsupported codec, by fetching and installing the required codecs, such reaction needs to be performed carefully and in accord with the system's normal validity and security checks and procedures.
