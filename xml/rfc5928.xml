                        <t>
                                The Traversal Using
Relays around NAT (TURN) specification <xref target="RFC5766"/> defines a process for a TURN client to find TURN servers by using DNS SRV resource records, but this process does not let the TURN server administrators provision the preferred TURN transport protocol between the client and the server and does not allow the TURN client to discover this preference.
This document defines an <xref target="RFC3958">S-NAPTR application</xref> for this purpose.
This application defines "RELAY" as an application service tag and "turn.udp", "turn.tcp", and "turn.tls" as application protocol tags.
</t>

<t>
Another usage of the resolution mechanism
described in this document would be Remote Hosting as described in
<xref target="RFC3958"/>, Section 4.4.
For example, a Voice over IP (VoIP) provider who does not want to deploy TURN servers could use the servers deployed by another company but could still want to provide configuration parameters to its customers without explicitly showing this relationship.
                                The mechanism permits one to implement this indirection, without preventing the company hosting the TURN servers from managing them as it sees fit.
                        </t>

                        <t>
                                <xref target="TURN-URI"/> can be used as a
convenient way of carrying the four components (see <xref target="resolution"/>) needed by the resolution mechanism described in this document.
                                A reference implementation is available <xref target="REF-IMPL"/>.

                <section anchor="resolution" title="Resolution Mechanism">
                        <t>
                                The resolution mechanism is used only to create an allocation.
                                All other transactions use the IP address, transport, and port used for a successful allocation creation.
                                The resolution mechanism only selects the transport used between the TURN client and the TURN server.
                                The transport used by the allocation itself is selected by the REQUESTED-TRANSPORT attribute as described in Section 6.1 of <xref target="RFC5766"/>.
                        </t>

                        <t>
                                The resolution algorithm uses a boolean flag, &lt;secure&gt;; an IP address or domain name, &lt;host&gt;; a port number that can be empty, &lt;port&gt;; and a transport name that can be "udp", "tcp", or empty, &lt;transport&gt; as input.
                                These four parameters are part of the user configuration of the TURN client.
                                The resolution mechanism also uses as input a
list, ordered by preference of supported TURN transports (UDP, TCP, Transport Layer
Security (TLS)), that is provided by the application using the TURN
 client.
                                This list reflects the capabilities and preferences of the application code that is using the S-NAPTR resolver and TURN client, as opposed to the configuration parameters that reflect the preferences of the user of the application.
                                The output of the algorithm is a list of {IP address, transport, port} tuples that a TURN client can try in order to create an allocation on a TURN server.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                                An Allocate error response as specified in Section 6.4 of <xref target="RFC5766"/> is processed as a failure, as specified by <xref target="RFC3958"/>, Section 2.2.4.
                                The resolution stops when a TURN client gets a successful Allocate response from a TURN server.
                                After an allocation succeeds or all the allocations fail, the resolution context MUST be discarded, and the resolution algorithm MUST be restarted from the beginning for any subsequent allocation.
                                Servers temporarily blacklisted as described in
Section 6.4 of <xref target="RFC5766"/>, specifically because of a 437, 486, or
508 error code, MUST NOT be used for the specified duration, even if returned by a subsequent resolution.
                        </t>
                        <t>First, the resolution algorithm checks that the parameters can be resolved with the list of TURN transports supported by the application:</t>
                        <t>

                                <list style="symbols">
                                        <t>If &lt;secure&gt; is false and &lt;transport&gt; is defined as "udp" but the list of TURN transports supported by the application does not contain UDP, then the resolution MUST stop with an error.</t>
                                        <t>If &lt;secure&gt; is false and &lt;transport&gt; is defined as "tcp" but the list of TURN transports supported by the application does not contain TCP, then the resolution MUST stop with an error.</t>
                                        <t>If &lt;secure&gt; is true and &lt;transport&gt; is defined as "udp", then the resolution MUST stop with an error.</t>
                                        <t>If &lt;secure&gt; is true and &lt;transport&gt; is defined as "tcp" but the list of TURN transports supported by the application does not contain TLS, then the resolution MUST stop with an error.</t>
                                        <t>If &lt;secure&gt; is true and &lt;transport&gt; is not defined but the list of TURN transports supported by the application does not contain TLS, then the resolution MUST stop with an error.</t>
                                        <t>If &lt;transport&gt; is defined but unknown, then the resolution MUST stop with an error.</t>
                                </list>
                        </t>

                        <t>
                                After verifying the validity of the parameters, the algorithm filters the list of TURN transports supported by the application by removing the UDP and TCP TURN transport if &lt;secure&gt; is true.
                                If the list of TURN transports is empty after this filtering, the resolution MUST stop with an error.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                                After filtering the list of TURN transports supported by the application, the algorithm applies the steps described below.
                                Note that in some steps, &lt;secure&gt; and &lt;transport&gt; have to be converted to a TURN transport.
                                If &lt;secure&gt; is false and &lt;transport&gt; is defined as "udp", then the TURN UDP transport is used.
                                If &lt;secure&gt; is false and &lt;transport&gt; is defined as "tcp", then the TURN TCP transport is used.
                                If &lt;secure&gt; is true and &lt;transport&gt; is defined as "tcp", then the TURN TLS transport is used.
                                This is summarized in <xref target="conversion"/>.

                                                If &lt;host&gt; is an IP address, then it indicates the specific IP address to be used.
                                                If &lt;port&gt; is not defined,
then either the default port declared in <xref target="RFC5766"/> for the "turn" SRV service name if &lt;secure&gt; is false, or the "turns" SRV service name if &lt;secure&gt; is true, MUST be used for contacting the TURN server.
                                                If &lt;transport&gt; is defined, then &lt;secure&gt; and &lt;transport&gt; are converted to a TURN transport as specified in <xref target="conversion"/>.
                                                If &lt;transport&gt; is not defined, the filtered TURN transports supported by the application are tried by preference order.
                                                If the TURN client cannot contact a TURN server with this IP address and port on any of the transports supported by the application, then the resolution MUST stop with an error.

                                                If &lt;host&gt; is a domain name and &lt;port&gt; is defined, then &lt;host&gt; is resolved to a list of IP addresses via DNS A and AAAA queries.
                                                If &lt;transport&gt; is defined, then &lt;secure&gt; and &lt;transport&gt; are converted to a TURN transport as specified in <xref target="conversion"/>.
                                                If &lt;transport&gt; is not defined, the filtered TURN transports supported by the application are tried in preference order.
                                                The TURN client can choose the order to contact the resolved IP addresses in any implementation-specific way.
                                                If the TURN client cannot contact a TURN server with this port, the transport or list of transports, and the resolved IP addresses, then the resolution MUST stop with an error.

                                                If &lt;host&gt; is a domain
name and &lt;port&gt; is not defined but &lt;transport&gt; is defined, then the
SRV algorithm defined in <xref target="RFC2782"/> is used to generate a list of
IP address and port tuples.  &lt;host&gt; is used as Name, a value of false
for &lt;secure&gt; as "turn" for Service, a value of true for &lt;secure&gt;
as "turns" for Service, and &lt;transport&gt; as Protocol (Proto) in the SRV
algorithm.  &lt;secure&gt; and &lt;transport&gt; are converted to a TURN
transport as specified in <xref target="conversion"/>, and this transport is
used with each tuple for contacting the TURN server.
                                                The SRV algorithm recommends doing an A query if the SRV query returns an error or no SRV RR;
                                                in this case, the default port declared in <xref target="RFC5766"/> for the "turn" SRV service name if &lt;secure&gt; is false, or the "turns" SRV service name if &lt;secure&gt; is true, MUST be used for contacting the TURN server.
                                                Also in this case, this specification modifies the SRV algorithm by recommending an A and AAAA query.
                                                If the TURN client cannot
contact a TURN server at any of the IP address and port tuples returned by the
SRV algorithm with the transport converted from &lt;secure&gt; and
&lt;transport&gt;, then the resolution MUST stop with an error.

                                        </t>

                                        <t>
                                                If &lt;host&gt; is a domain
name and &lt;port&gt; and &lt;transport&gt; are not defined, then &lt;host&gt;
is converted to an ordered list of IP address, port, and transport tuples via
the Straightforward Naming Authority Pointer (S-NAPTR) algorithm defined in <xref target="RFC3958"/> by using &lt;host&gt;
as the initial target domain name and "RELAY" as the application service
tag.  The filtered list of TURN transports supported by the application are
converted in application protocol tags by using "turn.udp" if the TURN
transport is UDP, "turn.tcp" if the TURN transport is TCP, and "turn.tls"
if the TURN transport is TLS.
                                                The order to try the application protocol tags is provided by the ranking of the first set of NAPTR records.
                                                If multiple application protocol tags have the same ranking, the preferred order set by the application is used.
                                                If the first NAPTR query fails, the processing continues in step 5.
                                                If the TURN client cannot contact a TURN server with any of the IP address, port, and transport tuples returned by the S-NAPTR algorithm, then the resolution MUST stop with an error.

                                        <t>
                                                If the first NAPTR query in the previous step does not return any result, then the SRV algorithm defined in <xref target="RFC2782"/> is used to generate a list of IP address and port tuples.
                                                The SRV algorithm is applied by
using each transport in the filtered list of TURN transports supported by the
application for the Protocol (Proto), &lt;host&gt; for the Name, "turn" for the Service if &lt;secure&gt; is false, or "turns" for the Service if &lt;secure&gt; is true.
                                                The same transport that was used to generate a list of tuples is used with each of these tuples for contacting the TURN server.
                                                The SRV algorithm recommends doing an A query if the SRV query returns an error or no SRV RR;
                                                in this case, the default port declared in <xref target="RFC5766"/> for the "turn" SRV service name if &lt;secure&gt; is false, or the "turns" SRV service name if &lt;secure&gt; is true, MUST be used for contacting the TURN server.
                                                Also in this case, this specification modifies the SRV algorithm by recommending an A and AAAA query.
                                                If the TURN client cannot contact a TURN server at any of the IP address and port tuples returned by the SRV algorithm with the transports from the filtered list, then the resolution MUST stop with an error.

                                        In the example in <xref
target="dns-rr2"/>, a VoIP provider (example.com) is using the TURN servers
managed by the administrators of the example.net domain (defined in <xref
target="dns-rr1"/>).
                                        The resolution algorithm using the
ordered TURN transport list of {TLS, TCP, UDP} would convert the same
parameters as in the previous example but with the &lt;host&gt; parameter
equal to "example.com" to the list of IP address, port, and protocol tuples in
<xref target="result1"/>.

                        <t>Security considerations for TURN are discussed in <xref target="RFC5766"/>.</t>

                        <t>
                                The application service tag and application protocol tags defined in this document do not introduce any specific security issues beyond the security considerations discussed in <xref target="RFC3958"/>.
                                <xref target="RFC3958"/> requests that an S-NAPTR application define some form of end-to-end authentication to ensure that the correct destination has been reached.
                                This is achieved by the Long-Term Credential Mechanism defined in [RFC5389], which is mandatory for <xref target="RFC5766"/>.
                        </t>

                        <t>
                                Additionally, the usage of <xref target="RFC5246">TLS</xref> has the capability to address the requirement.
                                In this case, the client MUST verify the identity of the server by following the identification procedure in Section 7.2.2 of <xref target="RFC5389"/> and by using the value of the &lt;host&gt; parameter as the identity of the server to be verified.
                        </t>

                        <t>
                                An implication of this is that the server's certificate could need to be changed when SRV or NAPTR records are added.
                                For example, a client using just A/AAAA records, and configured with "turnserver.example.net", expects to find the name "turnserver.example.net" in the certificate.
                                If a second client uses SRV records and is configured with &lt;host&gt; parameter "example.com", it expects to find "example.com" in the certificate, even if the SRV record at _turns._tcp.example.com points to turnserver.example.net.

<abstract>
<t>Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) is a protocol that serves as a tool for other protocols in dealing with Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal. It can be used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated to it by a NAT. It can also be used to check connectivity between two endpoints, and as a keep-alive protocol to maintain NAT bindings. STUN works with many existing NATs, and does not require any special behavior from them.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; STUN is not a NAT traversal solution by itself. Rather, it is a tool to be used in the context of a NAT traversal solution. This is an important change from the previous version of this specification (RFC 3489), which presented STUN as a complete solution.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; This document obsoletes RFC 3489.

<abstract>
<t>If a host is located behind a NAT, then in certain situations it can be
impossible for that host to communicate directly with other hosts (peers).  In
these situations, it is necessary for the host to use the services of an
intermediate node that acts as a communication relay.  This specification
defines a protocol, called TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT), that
allows the host to control the operation of the relay and to exchange packets
with its peers using the relay.  TURN differs from some other relay control
protocols in that it allows a client to communicate with multiple peers using
a single relay address. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t></abstract></front>
