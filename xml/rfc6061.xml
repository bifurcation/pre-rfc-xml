<abstract>
<t>This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) "nena" for Uniform
Resource Name (URN) resources published by the National Emergency Number
Association (NENA).  NENA defines and manages resources that utilize this URN
model.  Management activities for these and other resource types are provided
by the NENA Registry System (NRS).</t>

<section title="Introduction">	
<t>The National Emergency Number Association (NENA) is currently in the process
of setting standards, processes, and procedures for the use of an IP-based
Emergency Services IP Network (ESInet) for all public safety entities in North
America.  Some of the solutions being developed by NENA require XML namespaces
that are managed so that they are unique and persistent.  To assure that the
uniqueness is absolute, the registration of a specific Uniform Resource Name
(URN) <xref target="RFC2141"/> Namespace ID (NID) for use by NENA is
required.  This document defines and registers such a namespace in
accordance with <xref target="RFC3406"/>.</t>
</section>

<section title='URN Specification for "nena" NID'>

Namespace ID: nena

Registration information:

   registration version number: 1

   registration date: 2010-10-13

Declared registrant of the namespace:

   Registering organization
      Name:       National Emergency Number Association (NENA)
      Address:    4350 North Fairfax Drive, Suite 750
                  Arlington, VA  22203-1695

Designated contact:

   Role:    NENA Registry Services Administrator
   Email:   nrs-admin@nena.org

Declaration of syntactic structure:

   The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the
   "nena" NID will have the following structure:
      {NENAclass}:{ClassSpecificString}
</artwork></figure><t>

The "NENAclass" conforms to the URN syntax requirements <xref
target="RFC2141"/> and defines a specific class of resource type.  Each class
will have a specific labeling scheme that is covered by "ClassSpecificString",
which also conforms to the naming requirements of <xref target="RFC2141"/>.</t>

<t>
NENA maintains a naming authority, the National Emergency Number 
Association (NENA) Registry System (NRS), that will manage the
assignment of "NENAclass" and the specific registration values
assigned for each class.  Other NENA standards documents will
define the "ClassSpecificStrings" for a given "NENAclass".
</t>

<t>Relevant ancillary documentation:</t>
<list style="empty"><t>
The National Emergency Number Association Registry System (NRS)
provides information on the registered resources and the registrations
for each.  More information about the NRS and the registration activities
and procedures to be followed are defined in "NENA Registry System Standard", 
<xref target="NENA70-001">NENA 70-001</xref>, which is available at
http://www.nena.org/.</t></list>

<t>Identifier uniqueness considerations:</t>
<list style="empty"><t>
The NRS will manage resources using the "nena" NID and will be the
authority for managing the resources and subsequent strings
associated.  The NRS shall ensure the uniqueness of all nena URNs by
checking such names against the list of existing namespace names,
as documented in <xref target="NENA70-001">NENA 70-001</xref>.
</t></list>

<t>Identifier persistence considerations:</t>
<list style="empty"><t>
The NRS will provide clear documentation of the registered uses of the 
"nena" NID.  The NRS will establish a registry for "NENAclass", as defined
in <xref target="NENA08-003">NENA08-003</xref>.  Each "NENAclass" will have a
separate description in the registry and may have its own sub&nbhy;registry.  In
particular, new "NENAclass" registry entries will require a full NENA Technical
Standard document.</t></list>

<t>
The NRS will maintain a website at a stable address that provides XML and
text renderings of the urn:nena registry.
</t>

<t>Process of identifier assignment:</t>
<list style="empty"><t>
The NRS processes and procedures for identifier assignment are documented
in <xref target="NENA70-001">NENA 07-001</xref>.  The registry that will
control
the urn:nena namespace is defined in <xref target="NENA08-003">NENA
08-003</xref>.  In particular, assignments to the "NENAclass" registry will
require a NENA Technical Standard document.  Subregistries for particular
"NENAclasses" may be established by such technical standards.  Subregistries may
be defined to have more liberal management policies as defined
in <xref target="NENA70-001">NENA 70-001</xref>, but must be NRS managed
and will not be permitted to be delegated to any other organization or
registry.  Thus, the NRS will manage the entire urn:nena tree.</t></list>

<t>Process for identifier resolution:</t>
<list style="empty"><t>
The namespace is not currently listed with a Resolution Discovery System
(RDS), but nothing about the namespace prohibits the future definition of
appropriate resolution methods or listing with an RDS.</t></list>

<t>Rules for lexical equivalence:</t>
<list style="empty"><t>
No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence
of <xref target="RFC2141"/> apply.</t></list>

<t>Conformance with URN syntax:</t>
<list style="empty"><t>No special considerations.</t></list>

<t>Validation mechanism:</t>
<list style="empty"><t>None specified.  URN assignment will be handled
by procedures implemented in support of NENA activities.</t></list>

<t>Scope:</t>
<list style="empty"><t>Global</t></list>

<section title="Examples">
<t>The following examples are representative URNs that could be
assigned by the NRS.  They may not be the actual strings that would be
assigned.</t>

<figure><artwork>
NENAresource "psaproute"
Syntax: "urn:nena:emergencyresponders:&lt;responder name&gt;"
ResourceSpecificString: simple string with name of responder,
                        defined in a subregistry
Use: Defines the URN to be used for queries to an NG9-1-1 Emergency
Call Routing Function that provides URIs for responding agencies. 

Examples:

urn:nena:emergencyresponders:ambulance
urn:nena:emergencyresponders:fire
urn:nena:emergencyresponders:police
urn:nena:emergencyresponders:poison
urn:nena:emergencyresponders:coastguard
urn:nena:emergencyresponders:marine

<section title="Namespace Considerations">
<t>The National Emergency Number Association has developed standards for
emergency calling in North America for several decades.  NENA is developing a
variety of applications and services using Internet protocols built upon
IETF standards.  Some of these services require that supporting information
(e.g., data descriptions, attributes, etc.) be fully specified.  For proper
operation, descriptions of the needed supporting information must exist and be
available in a unique, reliable, and persistent manner.  These dependencies
provide the basis of the need for namespaces, in one form or another, and will
enable NENA to define URNs that are to assign cleaner, more general, more
permanent, more reliable, and more controllable namespace names related to
NENA standards, while keeping URNs defined by NENA properly separate from the
IETF-defined URNs.</t>
<t>
As the National Emergency Number Association work is ongoing and covers many
technical areas, the possibility of binding to various other namespace
repositories has been deemed impractical.  Each object or description, as
defined in NENA, could possibly be related to multiple different
namespaces, so further conflicts of association could occur.  Thus, the intent
is to utilize the National Emergency Number Association Registry System,
operated by NENA, as the naming authority for NENA-defined objects and
descriptions.</t>

</section>

<section title="Community Considerations">
<t>The North American public safety organizations will benefit from publication
of this namespace by having permanent and reliable URNs to be used with
protocols defined by NENA.  The objects and descriptions required for services
defined by NENA are generally available for use by other organizations.  The
National Emergency Number Association will provide access and support for name
requests by these organizations within the constraints of the defined NRS
processes and the specific urn:nena registry and subregistries.  This support
can be enabled in a timely and responsive fashion as new objects and
descriptions are produced.  These will be enabled in a fashion similar to
current IANA processes, as documented in <xref target="NENA70-001">NENA70&nbhy;001</xref>.</t>

<t>The NRS establishes registries when called for in a NENA Technical Standard.
Such standards must provide the NRS with clear and concise instructions on
creating and maintaining such registries.  Defined management policies include
"NENA Technical Standard Required", "NENA Document Required", "Expert Review",
and "First Come First Served", which correspond to similar IANA management
policies.  NENA is establishing a website that provides controlled entry of
new registries and entries in registries, and automatically produces HTML and
XML descriptions of registry contents that are used by vendors and other
consumers of the content.</t>

</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>There are no additional security considerations other than those normally
associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.</t>
</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">
<t>This document adds a new entry in the URN Namespaces registry.  The
namespace is "nena".  The defining document is this RFC.  The entry can
be found in the Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespaces registry available
from http://www.iana.org and any associated mirrors.</t>
