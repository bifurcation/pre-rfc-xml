      	<t>
This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) 'cablelabs' for Uniform Resource Names (URNs) used to identify resources published by Cable Television Laboratories, Inc. (CableLabs).  CableLabs specifies and manages resources that utilize this URN identification model.  Management activities for these and other resource types are handled by the manager of the CableLabs' Assigned Names and Numbers registry.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
	<t>
	CableLabs is a non-profit research and development consortium that is dedicated to pursuing new cable telecommunications technologies and to helping its cable operator members integrate those technical advancements into their business objectives.  Within CableLabs, specification activities are organized into projects such as DOCSIS(R), PacketCable(TM), and OpenCable(TM), and technical work is conducted within focus teams.  Product vendors, manufacturers, and cable operator members are invited to join the focus teams that create technical specifications.  
	</t>

	<t>

	Occasionally, CableLabs specification efforts require identifiers in a
managed namespace so that they are unique and persistent.  To ensure that the
uniqueness is absolute, the registration of a specific Uniform Resource Name
(URN) [RFC2141] Namespace Identifier (NID) for use by CableLabs is being specified in this document, in full conformance with the NID registration process specified in <xref target="RFC3406"></xref>.

		</t>


		<t>
			Declaration of syntactic structure:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the "cablelabs" NID will have the following structure:

		<vspace blankLines="1"/>

               {CLclass}:{CLClassSpecificString}

		<vspace blankLines="1"/>

The "CLclass" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the URN syntax requirements specified in  <xref target="RFC2141"></xref> and defines a specific class of resource type.  Each class will have a specific labeling scheme that is covered by "CLClassSpecificString", which also conforms to the naming requirements of <xref target="RFC2141"></xref>.

<vspace blankLines="1" />

CableLabs maintains the CableLabs' Assigned Names and Numbers <xref
target="CANN"></xref> specification that will contain the assignment of
CableLabs' resource classes and the specific registration values assigned for
each resource class.

				</t>
			</list>

		</t>

		<t>Relevant ancillary documentation:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>
					CableLabs publishes information regarding the registered resources in the CableLabs' Assigned Names and Numbers specification (<xref target="CANN"></xref>).
				</t>
			</list>
		</t>

		<t>Identifier uniqueness considerations:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>
					CableLabs will manage resource classes
using the "cablelabs" NID and will be the authority for managing resources and
associated subsequent strings. CableLabs is expected to guarantee the
uniqueness of the strings themselves, or it may permit secondary responsibility
for certain defined resources. 

<vspace blankLines="1" />

CableLabs could allow the use of experimental type values for testing purposes only.  Note that using experimental types may create collisions as multiple users may use the same values for resources and specific strings.
				</t>
			</list>
		</t>	

		<t>Identifier persistence considerations:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>
					CableLabs will update the CableLabs'
Assigned Names and Numbers specification (<xref target="CANN"></xref>) to
document the registered resources that use the "cablelabs" NID.

				</t>
			</list>
		</t>

		<t>Process of identifier assignment:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>
					CableLabs will provide procedures for registration of each type of resource that it maintains.  Each such resource may have three types of registration activities:
<vspace blankLines="1" />
				</t>


			  <list style="numbers">


				<t>Registered values associated with CableLabs documents or services</t>

				<t>Registration of values or sub-trees to other entities</t>

				<t>Name models for use in experimental purposes</t>
			  </list>
                        </list>
		</t>
		
		<t> Process for identifier resolution:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>
					The namespace is not listed with a resolution discovery system; this is not applicable for this URN registration.
				</t>
			</list>
		</t>
		
		<t> Rules for lexical equivalence:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of <xref target="RFC2141"></xref> apply.
				</t>
			</list>
		</t>
		
		<t> Conformance with URN syntax:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>No special considerations.</t>
			</list>
		</t>
		
		<t> Validation mechanism:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures implemented in support of CableLabs activities.

    <section title="Example">
      <t>The following example represents a hypothetical URN that could be assigned by CableLabs.</t>
	  <t>urn:cablelabs:packetcable-example:ue:rst-sample</t>
      <t>This example defines the URN to be used for User Equipment (UE) conforming to the sample Residential SIP Telephony (RST) application specified within CableLabs' PacketCable RST specification suite.</t>
    </section>

   <section title="Namespace Considerations">
      <t>CableLabs develops specifications that may require the use of data models.  URN Namespaces are key constructs to manage the definitions of those data models reliably with persistence and uniqueness.</t>
      <t/>
	  <t>The use of URNs should also help specification authors to maintain
different versions of URNs and dependencies between URNs across different
versions of CableLabs specifications if they so wish.</t>

    </section>

   <section title="Community Considerations">
	<t>

   Participants involved in the development and usage of CableLabs
specifications and cable industry deployments will benefit from the
publication of this namespace by providing consistent and reliable names for
the XML namespaces, schema locations, and similar identifiers of physical data
models published within CableLabs specifications.   

	<vspace blankLines="1"/>
   The CableLabs specifications are publicly available and are licensed to
manufacturers on a nondiscriminatory basis.  CableLabs will maintain the
allocation of resources for the "cablelabs" NID within the following
specification: "CableLabs' Assigned
 Names and Numbers" [CANN], which will be publicly available for viewing.  CableLabs will also maintain the corresponding specifications where the registered resources are referenced or used.  

	</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">

	<t>
This document adds a new entry ("cablelabs") in the urn-namespaces registry.
This is the defining document.  The entry can be found in the "Uniform Resource
Names (URN) Namespaces" registray available from the IANA site
(http://www.iana.org) and any associated mirrors.  
	</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">

      <t>There are no additional security considerations other than those
normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general,
which are described in <xref target="RFC1737"></xref>, <xref
target="RFC2141"></xref>, and <xref target="RFC3406"></xref>.</t>
