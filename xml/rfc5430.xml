               <t>The United States government has published
               guidelines for "NSA Suite B Cryptography",
	       which defines cryptographic algorithm policy
	       for national security applications.  This document
	       defines a profile of Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.2 that is fully
	       conformant with Suite B.  This document also defines
	       a transitional profile for use with TLS version 1.0
	       and TLS version 1.1 which employs Suite B algorithms to the
	       greatest extent possible.

<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
<t>
The United States government has posted the Fact Sheet on National Security
Agency (NSA) Suite B Cryptography [NSA], and at the time of writing, it states:
<artwork>
    To complement the existing policy for the use of the Advanced
    Encryption Standard (AES) to protect national security systems
    and information as specified in The National Policy on the use of
    the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to Protect National
    Security Systems and National Security Information (CNSSP-15),
    the National Security Agency (NSA) announced Suite B Cryptography
    at the 2005 RSA Conference.  In addition to the AES, Suite B
    includes cryptographic algorithms for hashing, digital
    signatures, and key exchange.

    Suite B only specifies the cryptographic algorithms to be
    used. Many other factors need to be addressed in determining
    whether a particular device implementing a particular set of
    cryptographic algorithms should be used to satisfy a particular
    requirement.  
</artwork>
</t>
<t>
Among those factors are "requirements for interoperability both
domestically and internationally".
</t>
<t>
This document does not define any new cipher suites; instead, it
defines two profiles:
</t>
<t>
 <list style="symbols">
  <t>
   A Suite B compliant profile for use with TLS version 1.2
   <xref target="RFC5246"/> and the cipher suites defined in
   <xref target="RFC5289"/>. This profile uses only Suite B
   algorithms.
  </t>
  <t>
   A transitional profile for use with TLS version 1.0 
   <xref target="RFC2246"/> or TLS version 1.1 <xref target="RFC4346"/>
   and the cipher suites defined in <xref target="RFC4492"/>. This
   profile uses the Suite B cryptographic algorithms to the greatest
   extent possible and provides backward compatibility.  While the
   transitional profile is not Suite B compliant, it provides a
   transition path towards the Suite B compliant profile.
  </t>
 </list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.
</t>
</section>
 
<section title="Suite B Requirements">
<t>
The Fact Sheet on Suite B Cryptography requires that key establishment and
authentication algorithms be based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and that the encryption
algorithm be AES <xref target="AES"/>. Suite B defines two security levels, of 128 and
192 bits.
</t>
<t>
In particular, Suite B includes:
<artwork>
     Encryption:         Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [AES] --
                         FIPS 197 (with key sizes of 128 and 256 bits)

     Digital Signature:  Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
                         (ECDSA) [DSS] - FIPS 186-2 (using the
                         curves with 256- and 384-bit prime moduli)

     Key Exchange:       Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) - NIST
                         Special Publication 800-56A [PWKE] (using the
                         curves with 256- and 384-bit prime moduli)
</artwork>
</t>
<t>
The 128-bit security level corresponds to an elliptic curve size of 256 bits
and AES-128; it also makes use of SHA-256 [SHS].  The 192-bit security level
corresponds to an elliptic curve size of 384 bits and AES-256; it also makes
use of SHA-384 [SHS].
</t>
<t>
Note: Some people refer to the two security levels based on the AES key size that
is employed instead of the overall security provided by the combination of
Suite B algorithms.  At the 128-bit security level, an AES key size of 128 bits
is used, which does not lead to any confusion.  However, at the 192-bit security
level, an AES key size of 256 bits is used, which sometimes leads to an
expectation of more security than is offered by the combination of Suite B
algorithms.
</t>
<t>
To accommodate backward compatibility, a Suite B compliant client or server
can be configured to accept a cipher suite that is not part of Suite B.  However, whenever a Suite B compliant client and a Suite B compliant
server establish a TLS version 1.2 session, only Suite B algorithms are
employed.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Suite B Compliance and Interoperability Requirements">
<t>
TLS version 1.1 <xref target="RFC4346"/> and earlier do not support Galois Counter Mode
(GCM) cipher suites <xref target="RFC5289"/>.  However, TLS version 1.2 <xref target="RFC5246"/>
and later do support GCM.  For Suite B TLS compliance, GCM cipher suites
are REQUIRED to be used whenever both the client and the server support the
necessary cipher suites.  Also, for Suite B TLS compliance, Cipher Block
Chaining (CBC) cipher suites are employed when GCM cipher suites
cannot be employed.
</t>
<t>
For a client to implement the Suite B compliant profile, it MUST implement
TLS version 1.2 or later, and the following cipher suite rules apply:
</t>
<t>
 <list style="symbols">
  <t>
   A Suite B compliant TLS version 1.2 or later client MUST offer at least
   two cipher suites for each supported security level.  For the 128-bit
   security level, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 MUST be offered in this
   order in the ClientHello message.  For the 192-bit security level,
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 and
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 MUST be offered in this
   order in the ClientHello message.  One of these cipher suites MUST
   be the first (most preferred) cipher suite in the ClientHello message.
  </t>
  <t>
   A Suite B compliant TLS version 1.2 or later client that offers backward
   compatibility with TLS version 1.1 or earlier servers MAY offer an
   additional cipher suite for each supported security level.  If these
   cipher suites are offered, they MUST appear after the ones discussed
   above.  For the 128-bit security level, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
   MAY be offered in the ClientHello message.  For the 192-bit security level,
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA MAY be offered in the ClientHello
   message.
  </t>
  <t>
   A Suite B compliant TLS version 1.2 or later client that offers
   interoperability with non-Suite B compliant servers MAY offer additional
   cipher suites.  If any additional cipher suites are offered, they MUST
   appear after the ones discussed above in the ClientHello message.
  </t>
 </list>
</t>
<t>
For a client to implement the Suite B transitional profile, it MUST implement
TLS version 1.1 or earlier and the following cipher suite rules apply:
</t>
<t>
 <list style="symbols">
  <t>
   A Suite B transitional TLS version 1.1 or earlier client MUST offer
   the cipher suite for the 128-bit security level, the cipher suite for
   the 192-bit security level, or both.   For the 128-bit security level,
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA MUST be offered in the
   ClientHello message.  For the 192-bit security level,
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA MUST be offered in the
   ClientHello message.  One of these cipher suites MUST be the first
   (most preferred) cipher suite in the ClientHello message.
  </t>
  <t>
   A Suite B transitional TLS version 1.1 or earlier client that offers
   interoperability with non-Suite B compliant servers MAY offer additional
   cipher suites.  If any additional cipher suites are offered, they MUST
   appear after the ones discussed above in the ClientHello message.
  </t>
 </list>
</t>
<t>
A Suite B compliant TLS server MUST be configured to support the 128-bit
security level, the 192-bit security level, or both security levels.  The
cipher suite rules for each of these security levels is described below.
If a Suite B compliant TLS server is configured to support both security
levels, then the configuration MUST prefer one security level over the
other.  In practice, this means that the cipher suite rules associated with
the cipher suites listed in <xref target="sec_levels"/> for the
preferred security level are processed before the cipher suite rules for
the less preferred security level.
</t>
<t>
For a server to implement the Suite B conformant profile at the 128-bit
security level, the following cipher suite rules apply:
</t>
<t>
 <list style="symbols">
  <t>
   A Suite B compliant TLS version 1.2 or later server MUST accept
   the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 cipher suite if it is offered.
  </t>
  <t>
   If the preceding cipher suite is not offered, then a Suite B compliant TLS version 1.2 or later server MUST accept the
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 cipher suite if it is offered.
  </t>
  <t>
   If neither of the preceding two cipher suites is offered, then a Suite B compliant TLS version 1.2 or later server that offers backward compatibility
   with TLS version 1.1 or earlier clients MAY accept the
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA cipher suite if it is offered.
  </t>
  <t>
   If the server is not offered any of the preceding three cipher suites and
   interoperability with clients that are not compliant or interoperable with
   Suite B is desired, then the server MAY accept another offered cipher suite
   that is considered acceptable by the server administrator.
  </t>
 </list>
</t>
<t>
For a server to implement the Suite B transitional profile at the 128-bit
security level, the following cipher suite rules apply:
</t>
<t>
 <list style="symbols">
  <t>
   A Suite B transitional TLS version 1.1 or earlier server MUST accept
   the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA cipher suite if it is offered.
  </t>
  <t>
   If the server is not offered the preceding cipher suite and interoperability
   with clients that are not Suite B transitional is desired, then the
   server MAY accept another offered cipher suite that is considered
   acceptable by the server administrator.
  </t>
 </list>
</t>
<t>
For a server to implement the Suite B conformant profile at the 192-bit
security level, the following cipher suite rules apply:
</t>
<t>
 <list style="symbols">
  <t>
   A Suite B compliant TLS version 1.2 or later server MUST accept
   the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 cipher suite if it is offered.
  </t>
  <t>
   If the preceding cipher suite is not offered, then a Suite B compliant TLS version 1.2 or later server MUST accept the
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 cipher suite if it is offered.
  </t>
  <t>
   If neither of the preceding two cipher suites is offered, then a Suite B compliant TLS version 1.2 or later server that offers backward compatibility
   with TLS version 1.1 or earlier clients MAY accept the
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA cipher suite if it is offered.
  </t>
  <t>
   If the server is not offered any of the preceding three cipher suites and
   interoperability with clients that are not compliant or interoperable with
   Suite B is desired, then the server MAY accept another offered cipher suite
   that is considered acceptable by the server administrator.
  </t>
 </list>
</t>
<t>
For a server to implement the Suite B transitional profile at the 192-bit
security level, the following cipher suite rules apply:
</t>
<t>
 <list style="symbols">
  <t>
   A Suite B transitional TLS version 1.1 or earlier server MUST accept
   the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA cipher suite if it is offered.
  </t>
  <t>
   If the server is not offered the preceding cipher suite and interoperability
   with clients that are not Suite B transitional is desired, then the
   server MAY accept another offered cipher suite that is considered
   acceptable by the server administrator.
  </t>
 </list>
</t>
<t>
Note that these rules explicitly permit the use of CBC cipher suites in
TLS version 1.2 connections in order to permit operation between Suite B
compliant and non-Suite B compliant implementations.  For instance, a
Suite B compliant TLS version 1.2 client might offer TLS version 1.2
with both GCM and CBC cipher suites when communicating with a non-Suite B
TLS version 1.2 server, which then selected the CBC cipher suites.  This
connection would nevertheless meet the requirements of this specification.
However, any two Suite B compliant implementations will negotiate a GCM
cipher suite when doing TLS version 1.2.
</t>

<section title="Security Levels" anchor="sec_levels">
<t>
As described in <xref target="intro"/>, Suite B specifies two 
security levels: 128-bit and 192-bit. The following table lists the
cipher suites for each security level. Within each security level, the
cipher suites are listed in their preferred order for selection by a
TLS version 1.2 implementation.
<texttable>
<ttcol>Cipher Suite</ttcol>
<ttcol>Security Level</ttcol>
<c>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</c><c>128</c>

<c>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA</c><c>192</c>
</texttable>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Acceptable Curves" anchor="acceptable.curves">
<t>
RFC 4492 defines a variety of elliptic curves.  For cipher suites
defined in this specification, only secp256r1(23) or
secp384r1(24) may be used. These are the same curves that
appear in FIPS 186-2 <xref target="DSS"/> as P-256 and P-384,
respectively.  For cipher suites at the 128-bit
security level, secp256r1 MUST be used.  For cipher suites at
the 192-bit security level, secp384r1 MUST be used.
RFC 4492 requires that the uncompressed(0) form be supported.
The ansiX962_compressed_prime(1) point formats MAY also be supported.
</t>
<t>
Clients desiring to negotiate only a Suite B compliant connection
MUST generate a "Supported Elliptic Curves Extension" containing only
the allowed curves. These curves MUST match the cipher suite security
levels being offered. Clients that are willing to do both Suite B compliant
and non-Suite B compliant connections MAY omit the extension or
send the extension but offer other curves as well as the appropriate
Suite B ones.
</t>
<t>
Servers desiring to negotiate a Suite B compliant connection
SHOULD check for the presence of the extension, but MUST NOT negotiate
inappropriate curves even if they are offered by the client. This allows
a client that is willing to do either Suite B compliant or
non-Suite B compliant modes to interoperate with a server that will
only do Suite B compliant modes. If the client does not advertise an
acceptable curve, the server MUST generate a fatal "handshake_failure"
alert and terminate the connection. Clients MUST check the chosen
curve to make sure it is acceptable.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Certificates">
<t>
Server and client certificates used to establish a Suite B compliant
connection MUST be signed with ECDSA.  Digital signatures MUST be
calculated using either the P-256 curve along with the SHA-256 hash
algorithm or calculated using the P-384 curve along with the SHA-384
hash algorithm.  For certificates used at the 128-bit security level,
the subject public key MUST use the P-256 curve and be signed with
either the P-384 curve or the P-256 curve.  For certificates used at
the 192-bit security level, the subject public key MUST use the P-384
curve and be signed with the P-384 curve.
</t>
<t>
In TLS version 1.0 and TLS version 1.1, the key exchange algorithm used in
the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA-collection of cipher suites requires the server's certificate
to be signed with a particular signature scheme. TLS version 1.2 offers
more flexibility. This specification does not impose any additional
restrictions on the server certificate signature or the signature schemes used
elsewhere in the certification path.  (Often such restrictions will be useful, and
it is expected that this will be taken into account in practices of certification
authorities. However, such restrictions are not strictly required, even if it
is beyond the capabilities of a client to completely validate a given
certification path, the client may be able to validate the server's certificate
by relying on a trusted certification authority whose certificate appears
as one of the intermediate certificates in the certification path.)
</t>
<t>
Likewise, this specification does not impose restrictions on signature
schemes used in the certification path for the client's certificate
when mutual authentication is employed.
</t>
</section>

<section title="signature_algorithms Extension">
<t>
The signature_algorithms extension is defined in Section 7.4.1.4.1
of TLS version 1.2 <xref target="RFC5246"/>.  A Suite B compliant TLS
version 1.2 or later client MUST include the signature_algorithms
extension.  For the 128-bit security level, SHA-256 with ECDSA MUST be
offered in the signature_algorithms extension.  For the 192-bit security
level, SHA-384 with ECDSA MUST be offered in the signature_algorithms
extension.  Other offerings MAY be included to indicate the signature
algorithms that are acceptable in cipher suites that are offered for
interoperability with servers that are not compliant with Suite B and
to indicate the signature algorithms that are acceptable for
certification path validation.
</t>
</section>

<section title="CertificateRequest Message">
<t>
A Suite B compliant TLS version 1.2 or later server MUST include
SHA-256 with ECDSA and/or SHA-384 with ECDSA in the
supported_signature_algorithms field of the CertificateRequest
message. For the 128-bit security level, SHA-256 with ECDSA MUST
appear in the supported_signature_algorithms field. For the 192-bit security level, SHA-384 with ECDSA MUST appear in the
supported_signature_algorithms field.
</t>
</section>

<section title="CertificateVerify Message">
<t>
A Suite B compliant TLS version 1.2 or later client MUST use
SHA-256 with ECDSA or SHA-384 with ECDSA for the signature in the
CertificateVerify message.  For the 128-bit security level, SHA-256
with ECDSA MUST be used. For the 192-bit security level, SHA-384
with ECDSA MUST be used.
</t>
</section>

<section title="ServerKeyExchange Message Signature">
<t>
In the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA-collection of cipher suites, the server sends its
ephemeral ECDH public key and a specification of the corresponding curve
in the ServerKeyExchange message.  These parameters MUST be signed with
ECDSA using the private key corresponding to the public key in the
server's certificate.
</t>
<t>
A TLS version 1.1 or earlier server MUST sign the ServerKeyExchange
message using SHA-1 with ECDSA.
</t>
<t>
A Suite B compliant TLS version 1.2 or later server MUST sign the
ServerKeyExchange message using either SHA-256 with ECDSA or SHA-384
with ECDSA.  For the 128-bit security level, SHA-256 with ECDSA MUST be
used.  For the 192-bit security level, SHA-384 with ECDSA MUST be used.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
Most of the security considerations for this document are described
in "The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2" <xref target="RFC5246"/>, "Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
Cipher Suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)" <xref target="RFC4492"/>, "AES Galois Counter Mode (GCM) Cipher Suites
for TLS" <xref target="RFC5288"/>, and "TLS Elliptic Curve Cipher Suites with
SHA-256/384 and AES Galois Counter Mode (GCM)" <xref target="RFC5289"/>.
Readers should consult those documents.
</t>
<t>
In order to meet the goal of a consistent security level for the
entire cipher suite, in Suite B mode TLS implementations MUST ONLY
use the curves defined in <xref target="acceptable.curves"/>.
Otherwise, it is possible to have a set of symmetric algorithms
with much weaker or stronger security properties than the
