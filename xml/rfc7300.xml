    <abstract>
	    <t>This document reserves two Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) at the end of the 16-bit and 32-bit ranges, described in this document as "Last ASNs", and provides guidance to implementers and operators on their use.  This document updates Section 10 of RFC 1930.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>
   Over a decade ago, IANA reserved the last Autonomous System Number 
   (ASN) of the 16-bit ASN range, 65535, with the intention that it 
   not be used by network operators running BGP [RFC4271].

  Since the introduction of "BGP Support
	    for Four-Octet Autonomous System (AS) Number Space" <xref
	    target="RFC6793" />, IANA has also reserved the last ASN of the
	    32-bit autonomous system number range, 4294967295.  This
	    reservation has been documented in the IANA "Autonomous System (AS) Numbers" registry <xref target="IANA.AS" />.  Although these "Last ASNs" border on Private Use ASN <xref target="RFC6996" /> ranges, they are not defined or reserved as Private Use ASNs by <xref target="IANA.AS" />.  This document describes the reasoning for reserving Last ASNs and provides guidance both to operators and to implementers on their use.</t>
    </section>
     <section title="Requirements Language">
       <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
     </section>
    <section anchor="reasons" title="Reasons for Reservation of the Last ASNs">
	    <t>A subset of the BGP communities of ASN 65535, the last ASN of
	    the 16-bit range, are reserved for use by Well-known Communities
	    as described in <xref target="RFC1997" /> and <xref
	    target="IANA.WK" />.  Although this is not currently true of ASN
	    4294967295, if there is a future need for another Special Use ASN
	    that is not designed to be globally routable, or for the associated BGP communities of such an ASN, ASN 4294967295 could be a valid candidate for such purpose.  This document does not prescribe any such Special Use to this ASN at the time of publication.</t> 
    </section>
    <section anchor="ops" title="Operational Considerations">
	    <t>Operators SHOULD NOT use these Last ASNs for any other purpose or as Private Use ASNs.  Operational use of these Last ASNs could have undesirable results.  For example; use of AS 65535 as if it were a Private Use ASN, may result in inadvertent use of BGP Well-known Community values <xref target="IANA.WK" />, causing undesirable routing behavior.</t>
	    <t>Last ASNs MUST NOT be advertised to the global Internet within AS_PATH or AS4_PATH attributes.  Operators SHOULD filter Last ASNs within the AS_PATH and AS4_PATH attributes.</t>
    </section>


    <section anchor="impl" title="Implementation Considerations">
	    <t>While Last ASNs are reserved, they remain valid ASNs from a BGP perspective.  Therefore, implementations of BGP <xref target="RFC4271" /> SHOULD NOT treat the use of Last ASNs as any type of protocol error.  However, if a Last ASN is configured as the local AS, implementations MAY generate a warning message indicating improper use of a reserved ASN.</t>
	    <t>Implementations that provide tools that filter Private Use ASNs within the AS_PATH and AS4_PATH attributes MAY also include Last ASNs.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
	   <t>IANA has reserved last Autonomous System number 65535 from the "16-bit Autonomous System Numbers" registry for the reasons described in this document.</t>
	   <t>IANA has also reserved last Autonomous System number 4294967295 from the "32-bit Autonomous System Numbers" registry for the reasons described in this document.</t>
	   <t>These reservations have been documented in the IANA "Autonomous
	   System (AS) Numbers" registry <xref target="IANA.AS"/> and the IANA
	   "Special-Purpose Autonomous System (AS) Numbers" registry <xref target="IANA.SpecialAS" />.</t>
   </section>
   <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
	   <t>This document does not introduce any additional security concerns in regards to usage of Last ASNs.  Although the BGP is designed to allow usage of Last ASNs, security issues related to BGP implementation errors could be triggered by Last ASN usage.</t>
