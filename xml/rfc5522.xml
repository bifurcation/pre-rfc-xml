      <t>This document describes the requirements and desired properties of
      Network Mobility (NEMO) Route Optimization techniques for use in
      global-networked communications systems for aeronautics and
      space exploration.</t>

      <t>Substantial input to these requirements was given by aeronautical
      communications experts outside the IETF, including members of the
      International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and other aeronautical
      communications standards bodies.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>As background, the Network Mobility (NEMO) terminology and
      NEMO goals and requirements
      documents are suggested reading (<xref target="RFC4885"/>,
      <xref target="RFC4886"/>).</t>
      
      <t>The base NEMO standard <xref target="RFC3963"></xref> extends Mobile
          IPv6 <xref target="RFC3775"></xref> for singular mobile hosts in
          order to be used by Mobile Routers (MRs) supporting entire mobile
          networks.  NEMO allows mobile networks to efficiently remain
          reachable via fixed IP address prefixes no matter where they relocate
          within the network topology. This is accomplished through the
          maintenance of a bidirectional tunnel between a NEMO MR and a
          NEMO-supporting Home Agent (HA) placed at some relatively stable
          point in the network.  NEMO does not provide Mobile IPv6's Route
          Optimization (RO) features to Mobile Network Nodes (MNNs)
          other than to the NEMO MR itself.  Corresponding Nodes (CNs) that communicate with
          MNNs behind an MR do so through the HA and the bidirectional Mobile
          Router - Home Agent (MRHA) tunnel. Since the use of this tunnel may
          have significant drawbacks <xref target="RFC4888"/>, RO techniques
          that allow a more direct path between the CN and MR to be used are
          highly desirable.</t>

      <t>For decades, mobile networks of some form have been used for
          communications with people and avionics equipment on board aircraft
          and spacecraft. 
          These have not typically used IP, although
          architectures are being devised and deployed based on IP in both the
          aeronautics and space exploration communities (see <xref
              target="aerocomm"></xref> and <xref target="spacecomm"></xref>
          for more information). An aircraft or spacecraft generally contains
          many computing nodes, sensors, and other devices that are possible to
          address individually with IPv6. This is desirable to support
          network-centric operations concepts. Given that a craft has only a
          small number of access links, it is very natural to use NEMO MRs to
          localize the functions needed to manage the large onboard network's
          reachability over the few dynamic access links. On an aircraft, the
          nodes are arranged in multiple, independent networks, based on their
          functions. These multiple networks are required for regulatory
          reasons to have different treatments of their air-ground
          traffic and must often use distinct air-ground links and service providers.</t>

    <t>For aeronautics, the main disadvantage of using NEMO bidirectional
        tunnels is that airlines operate flights that traverse multiple
        continents, and a single plane may fly around the entire world over a
        span of a couple days.  If a plane uses a static HA on a single
        continent, then for a large percentage of the time, when the plane is
        not on the same continent as the HA, a great amount of delay is imposed
        by using the MRHA tunnel.  Avoiding the delay from unnecessarily
        forcing packets across multiple continents is the primary goal of
        pursuing NEMO RO for aeronautics.</t>

      <t>Other properties of the aeronautics and space environments amplify the
      known issues with NEMO bidirectional MRHA tunnels <xref
          target="RFC4888"/> even further.
      
      <list>

          <t>Longer routes leading to increased delay and additional
              infrastructure load:
<list><?rfc subcompact="yes" ?>     
<t>In aeronautical networks (e.g., using "Plain
              Old" Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System
              (ACARS) or ACARS over VHF Data Link (VDL) mode 2) the queueing
              delays are often long due to Automatic Repeat Request
              (ARQ) mechanisms and underprovisioned radio links. 
              Furthermore, for space exploration and for aeronautical communications systems
              that pass through geosynchronous satellites, the
              propagation delays are also long. These delays,
              combined with the additional need to cross continents in order to
              transport packets between ground stations and CNs, mean that
              delays are already quite high in aeronautical and space networks
              without the addition of an MRHA tunnel. The increased delays
              caused by MRHA tunnels may be unacceptable in meeting Required
              Communication Performance <xref target="RCP"></xref>.</t></list></t>
<?rfc subcompact="no" ?>     
          <t>Increased packet overhead: 
<list><?rfc subcompact="yes" ?>
<t>Given the constrained link bandwidths
              available in even future communications systems for aeronautics
              and space exploration, planners are extremely adverse to header
              overhead. Since any amount of available link capacity can be
              utilized for extra situational awareness, science data, etc.,
              every byte of header/tunnel overhead displaces a byte of useful
              data.</t></list></t>
<?rfc subcompact="no" ?>
      <t>Increased chances of packet fragmentation: 
<list><?rfc subcompact="yes" ?>
<t>RFC 4888 <xref target="RFC4888" /> identifies
          fragmentation due to encapsulation as an artifact of tunneling.
          While links used in the aeronautics and space domains are error-prone
          and may cause loss of fragments on the initial/final hop(s),
          considerations for fragmentation along the entire tunneled path are
          the same as for the terrestrial domain.</t></list></t>
<?rfc subcompact="no" ?>
          <t>Increased susceptibility to failure: 
<list><?rfc subcompact="yes" ?>
<t>The additional likelihood of
              either a single link failure disrupting all communications or an
              HA failure disrupting all communications is problematic when
              using MRHA tunnels for command and control applications that
              require high availability for safety-of-life or
              safety-of-mission.</t> </list></t></list></t>
<?rfc subcompact="no" ?>
      <t>For these reasons, an RO extension to NEMO is highly desirable for use
          in aeronautical and space networking. In fact, a standard RO
          mechanism may even be necessary before some planners will seriously
          consider advancing use of the NEMO technology from experimental
          demonstrations to operational use within their communications
          architectures. Without an RO solution, NEMO is difficult to justify
          for realistic operational consideration.</t>

      <t>In <xref target="scenarios"></xref> we describe the relevant
          high-level features of the access and onboard networks envisioned for
          use in aeronautics and space exploration, as they influence the
          properties of usable NEMO RO solutions. <xref
              target="required"></xref> then lists the technical and functional
          characteristics that are absolutely required of a NEMO RO solution
          for these environments, while <xref target="desirable"></xref> lists
          some additional characteristics that are desired but not necessarily
          required. In <xref target="aerocomm"></xref> and <xref
              target="spacecomm"></xref> we provide brief primers on the
          specific operational concepts used in aeronautics and space
          exploration, respectively, for IP-based network architectures.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
          "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
          document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
          <xref target="RFC2119" />. Although
          this document does not specify an actual protocol, but
          rather specifies just the requirements for a protocol, it
          still uses the RFC 2119 language to make the requirements
          clear.</t>
  
    </section>

    <section anchor="scenarios" title="NEMO RO Scenarios">
      <t>To motivate and drive the development of the requirements and
      desirable features for NEMO RO solutions, this section describes some
      operational characteristics to explain how access
      networks, HAs, and CNs are configured and distributed geographically and
      topologically in aeronautical and space network architectures.
      This may be useful in determining which classes of RO techniques
      within the known solution space <xref target="RFC4889"/> are
      feasible.</t>

      <section title="Aeronautical Communications Scenarios">
        <t>Since aircraft may be simultaneously connected to multiple ground
        access networks using diverse technologies with different coverage
        properties, it is difficult to say much in general about the rate of
        changes in active access links and care-of addresses (CoAs). As one
        data point, for using VDL mode 2 data links, the length of time spent
        on a single access channel varies depending on the stage of flight. On
        the airport surface, VDL mode 2 access is stable while a plane is
        unloaded, loaded, refueled, etc., but other wired and wireless LAN
        links (e.g. local networks available while on a gate) may come
        and go. Immediately after
        takeoff and before landing, planes are in the terminal maneuvering
        area for approximately 10 minutes and stably use another VDL mode 2
        channel. During en route flight, handovers between VDL mode 2 channels
        may occur every 30 to 60 minutes, depending on the exact flight plan
        and layout of towers, cells, and sectors used by a service
	provider.  These handovers may result in having a different access
	router and a change in CoA, though the use of local mobility
	management (e.g., <xref target="RFC4831"/>) may limit the changes in CoA
	to only handovers between different providers or types of data
	links.</t>


	<t>The characteristics of a data flow between a CN and MNN varies both
	depending on the data flow's domain and on the particular
	application within the domain. Even within the three
	aeronautical domains described below, there are varying classes
	of service that are regulated differently (e.g., for emergencies
	versus nominal operations), but this level of detail has been
	abstracted out for the purposes of this document. It is assumed
	that any viable NEMO RO solution will be able to support a
	granularity of configuration with many sub-classes of traffic
	within each of the specific domains listed here.</t>

<section title="Air Traffic Services Domain">
    
    <t>The MNNs involved in Air Traffic Services (ATS) consist of pieces of
        avionics hardware on board an aircraft that are used to provide navigation,
        control, and situational awareness. The applications run by these MNNs
        are mostly critical to the safety of the lives of the passengers and
        crew. The MNN equipment may consist of a range of devices from typical
        laptop computers to very specialized avionics devices. These MNNs will
        mostly be Local Fixed Nodes (LFNs), with a few Local Mobile Nodes
        (LMNs) to support Electronic Flight Bags, for instance. It can be
        assumed that Visiting Mobile Nodes (VMNs) are never used within the ATS
        domain.</t>

          <t>An MR used for ATS will be capable of using multiple data links
              (at least VHF-based, satellite, HF-based, and wired), and will
              likely be supported by a backup unit in the case of failure,
              leading to a case of a multihomed MR that is at least
              multi-interfaced and possibly multi-prefixed as well, in NEMO
              terminology.</t>

  
      <t>The existing ATS link technologies may be too anemic for a complete
          IP-based ATS communications architecture (link technologies and
          acronyms are briefly defined in <xref target="aerocomm"/>).  At the
          time of this writing, the ICAO is pursuing future data link standards
          that support higher data rates.  
          Part of the problem is limited
          spectrum, pursued under ICAO ACP-WG-F, "Spectrum Management", and
          part of the problem is the data link protocols themselves, pursued
          under ICAO ACP-WG-T, "Future Communications Technology".  ACP-WG-T
          has received inputs from studies on a number of potential
          data link protocols, including B-AMC, AMACS, P34, LDL, WCDMA, and others.
          Different link technologies may be used in different stages of
          flight, for instance 802.16 in the surface and terminal area, P34 or
          LDL en route, and satcom in oceanic flight.  Both current and planned
          data links used for Passenger Information and Entertainment
          Services (PIES) and/or Airline Operational Services (AOS),
          such as the satcom links employed
          by passenger Internet-access systems, support much higher data rates
          than current ATS links.</t>

      <t>Since, for ATS, the MRs and MNNs are under regulatory control and are
          actively tested and maintained, it is not completely unreasonable to
          assume that special patches or software be run on these devices
          to enable NEMO RO. In fact, since these devices are accessed by
          skilled technicians and professionals, it may be that some
          special configuration is required for NEMO RO. Of course, simplicity
          in set up and configuration is highly preferable, however, and the
          desirable feature labeled &quot;Des1&quot; later in this document
          prefers solutions with lower configuration state and overhead.  To
          minimize costs of ownership and operations, it is also highly
          desirable for only widely available, off-the-shelf operating systems
          or network stacks to be required, but this is not a full requirement.</t>

          <t>Data flows from the ATS domain may be assumed to consist mainly
          of short transactional exchanges, such as clearance requests and
          grants. Future ATS communications are likely to include longer
          messages and higher message frequencies for positional awareness and
          trajectory intent of all vehicles in motion at the airport and all
          aircraft within a thirty-mile range during flight. Many of these may
          be aircraft-to-aircraft, but the majority of current exchanges are
          between the MNNs and a very small set of CNs within a control
          facility and take place at any time due to the full transfer of control as a plane
          moves across sectors of airspace.
          The set of CNs may be assumed to
          be topologically close to one another. These CNs are also involved in
          other data flows over the same access network that the MR is
          attached to, managing other flights within the sector. These CNs are
          often geographically and topologically much closer to the MR in
	  comparison to a single fixed HA.</t>
  
	  <t>
	  The MNNs and CNs used for ATS will support IP services, as IP is the basis
      of the new Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN) architecture
      being defined by ICAO.  Some current ATS ground systems run typical
      operating systems, like Solaris, Linux, and Windows, on typical workstation
      computer hardware.  There is some possibility for an RO solution to
      require minor changes to these CNs, though it is much more desirable if
      completely off-the-shelf CN machines and operating systems can be used.
      Later in this document, the security requirements suggest that RO might
      be performed with mobility anchors that are topologically close to the
      CNs, rather than directly to CNs themselves.  This could possibly mean
      that CN modifications are not required.  </t>

	<t>
	During the course of a flight, there are several events for which an RO
	solution should consider the performance implications:
	<list style="symbols">
		<t>Initial session creation with an ATS CN (called "Data Link Logon" in the aeronautical jargon).</t>
		<t>Transfer of control between ATS CNs, resulting in regional differences in where the controlling CN is located.</t>
		<t>Aircraft-initiated contact with a non-controlling ATS CN, which may be located anywhere, without relation to the controlling CN.</t>
		<t>Non-controlling, ATS, CN-initiated contact with the aircraft.</t>
		<t>Aircraft transition between one access link to another, resulting in change of CoA.</t>
		<t>Concurrent use of multiple access links with different care-of addresses.</t>
	</list>
	</t>

        </section>

        <section title="Airline Operational Services Domain">
          <t>Data flows for Airline Operational Services (AOS) are not
          critical to the safety of the passengers or aircraft, but are needed
          for the business operations of airlines operating flights, and may
          affect the profitability of an airline's flights. Most of these data
          flows are sourced by MNNs that are part of the flight management
          system or sensor nodes on an aircraft, and are terminated at CNs
          located near an airline's headquarters or operations center. AOS
          traffic may include detailed electronic passenger manifests,
          passenger ticketing and rebooking traffic, and complete electronic
          baggage manifests. When suitable bandwidth is available
          (currently on the surface when connected to a wired link at
          a gate), "airplane health information" data transfers of
          between 10 and several hundred megabytes of data are likely,
          and in the future, it is expected that the In-Flight
          Entertainment (IFE) systems may receive movie refreshes of
          data (e.g., television programming or recent news updates)
          running into the multi-gigabyte range.</t>

          <t>Currently, these flows are often short messages that record the
          timing of events of a flight, engine performance data, etc., but may
          be longer flows that upload weather or other supplementary data to
          an aircraft. In addition, email-like interactive messaging may be
          used at any time during a flight. For instance, messages can be
          exchanged before landing to arrange for arrival-gate services to be
          available for handicapped passengers, refueling, food and beverage
          stocking, and other needs. This messaging is not limited to landing
          preparation, though, and may occur at any stage of flight.</t>

          <t>The equipment comprising these MNNs and CNs has similar
          considerations to the equipment used for the ATS domain. A key
          difference between ATS and AOS is that AOS data flows are routed to
          CNs that may be much more geographically remote to the aircraft than
          CNs used by ATS flows, as AOS CNs will probably be located at an
          airline's corporate data center or headquarters. The AOS CNs will
          also probably be static for the lifetime of the flight, rather than
          dynamic like the ATS CNs. An HA used for AOS may be fairly close
          topologically to the CNs, and RO may not be as big of a benefit for
          AOS since simple event logging is more typical than time-critical
          interactive messaging. For the small number of messaging flows,
          however, the CNs are geographically (but not necessarily
          topologically) very close to the aircraft, though this
          depends on how applications are written -- whether they use
          centralized servers or exchange messages directly. Additionally, since AOS
          communication is more advisory in nature than ATS, rather than
          safety-critical, AOS flows are less sensitive to tunnel
          inefficiencies than ATS flows. For these reasons, in this document,
          we consider AOS data flow concerns with RO mechanisms to not be full
          requirements, but instead consider them desirable
	  properties, which are discussed in <xref target="desirable"></xref>.</t>

	  <t>Future AOS MNNs and CNs can be expected to implement IPv6 and
	  conform to the new IPv6-based ATN Standards and Recommended
	  Practices (SARPS) that ICAO is
	  defining.  AOS CNs have similar hardware and software
	  properties as described for ATS above.</t>

        <section title="Passenger Services Domain">
          <t>The MNNs involved in the Passenger Information and Entertainment
          Services (PIES) domain are mostly beyond the direct control of any
          single authority. The majority of these MNNs are VMNs and personal
          property brought on board by passengers for the duration of a flight,
          and thus it is unreasonable to assume that they be preloaded with
          special software or operating systems. These MNNs run stock Internet
          applications like web browsing, email, and file transfer, often
          through VPN tunnels. The MNNs themselves are portable electronics,
          such as laptop computers and mobile smartphones capable of
          connecting to an onboard wireless access network (e.g., using
          802.11). To these MNN devices and users, connecting to the onboard
          network is identical to connecting to any other terrestrial
          "hotspot" or typical wireless LAN. The MNNs are completely oblivious
          to the fact that this access network is on an airplane and possibly
          moving around the globe. The users are not always
          technically proficient and may not be capable of performing any
          special configuration of their MNNs or applications.</t>

	  <t>The largest class of PIES CNs consists of typical web servers and
	  other nodes on the public Internet.  It is not reasonable to
	  assume that these can be modified specifically to support a
	  NEMO RO scheme.  Presently, these CNs would be mostly IPv4-based,
	  though an increasing number of IPv6 PIES CNs are expected in the
	  future.  This document does not consider the problem of IPv4-IPv6
  	  transition, beyond the assumption that either MNNs and CNs are
	  running IPv6 or a transition mechanism exists somewhere
          within the network.</t>
	  
          <t>A small number of PIES MNNs may be LFNs that store and distribute
          cached media content (e.g., movies and music) or that may provide gaming
          services to passengers. Due to the great size of the data stored on
          these LFNs compared to the anemic bandwidth available air-to-ground,
          these LFNs will probably not attempt to communicate off-board at all
          during the course of a flight, but will wait to update their content
          via either high-speed links available on the ground or
          removable media inserted by the flight crew. However, if a higher bandwidth link were affordably available, it might be used in-flight for these purposes, but supporting this is not a requirement.  Data flows needed
	  for billing passengers for access to content are relatively
	  low bandwidth and are currently done in-flight.  The requirements
	  of these data flows are less stringent than those of ATS, however, so they are not specifically considered here.</t>

          <t>The PIES domain is not critical to safety-of-life, but is merely
          an added comfort or business service to passengers. Since PIES
          applications may consume much more bandwidth than the available
          links used in other domains, the PIES MNNs may have their packets
          routed through a separate high-bandwidth link that is not used by
          the ATS data flows. For instance, several service providers are
          planning to offer passenger Internet access during flight at
          DSL-like rates, just as the former Connexion by Boeing system did. Several
          airlines also plan to offer onboard cellular service to their
          passengers, possibly utilizing Voice-over-IP for transport. Due to
          the lack of criticality and the likelihood of being treated
          independently, in this document, PIES MNN concerns are not
          considered as input to requirements in <xref
          target="required"></xref>. The RO solution should be optimized for
          ATS and AOS needs and consider PIES as a secondary concern.</t>

          <t>With this in consideration, the PIES domain is also the most
          likely to utilize NEMO for communications in the near-term, since
          relatively little regulations and bureaucracy are involved in
          deploying new technology in this domain and since IP-based PIES systems
          have previously been developed and deployed (although not using
          NEMO) <xref target="Dul05"></xref>. For these reasons, PIES concerns
          factor heavily into the desirable properties in <xref
          target="desirable"></xref>, outside of the mandatory
          requirements.</t>

          <t>Some PIES nodes are currently using 2.5G/3G links for mobile data
          services, and these may be able to migrate to an IP-based onboard
          mobile network, when available.</t>

      <section title="Space Exploration Scenarios">
        <t>This section describes some features of the network environments
        found in space exploration that are relevant to selecting an
        appropriate NEMO RO mechanism. It should be noted that IPv4-based
        mobile routing has been demonstrated on board the UK-DMC satellite and
        that the documentation on this serves as a useful reference for
        understanding some of the goals and configuration issues for certain
        types of space use of NEMO <xref target="IPS+05"></xref>. This section
        assumes space use of NEMO within the "near-Earth" range of space (i.e.,
        not for communications between the Earth and Mars or other
        "deep space" locations). Note that NEMO is currently being considered 
	for use out to lunar distances.  No strong distinction is made here between
        civilian versus military use, or exploration mission versus
        Earth-observing or other mission types; our focus is on civilian
        exploration missions, but we believe that many of the same basic
        concerns are relevant to these other mission types.</t>

        <t>In space communications, a high degree of bandwidth asymmetry is
        often present, with the uplink from the ground to a craft typically
        being multiple orders of magnitude slower than the downlink from the
        craft to the ground. This means that the RO overhead may be negligible
        on the downlink but significant for the uplink. An RO scheme that
        minimizes the amount of signaling from CNs to an MN is desirable,
        since these uplinks may be low-bandwidth to begin with (possibly only
        several kilobits per second). Since the uplink is used for sending
        commands, it should not be blocked for long periods while serializing
        long RO signaling packets; any RO signaling from the CN to MNNs must
        not involve large packets.</t>

        <t>For unmanned space flight, the MNNs on board a spacecraft consist
        almost entirely of LFN-sensing devices and processing devices that
        send telemetry and science data to CNs on the ground and actuator
        devices that are commanded from the ground in order to control the
        craft. Robotic lunar rovers may serve as VMNs behind an MR located on
        a lander or orbiter, but these rovers will contain many independent
        instruments and could probably be configured as an MR and LFNs instead of
        using a single VMN address.</t>

        <t>It can be assumed that for manned spaceflight, at least multiple
        MRs will be present and online simultaneously for fast failover.
        These will usually be multihomed over space links in diverse frequency
        bands, and so multiple access network prefixes can be expected
        to be in use simultaneously, especially since some
        links will be direct to ground stations while others may be bent-pipe
	repeated through satellite relays like the Tracking and Data
        Relay Satellite System (TDRSS).  
        This conforms to the (n,1,1) or (n,n,1) NEMO multihoming scenarios
        <xref target="RFC4980"/>.  For unmanned missions,
        if low weight and power are more critical, it is likely that only a
	single MR and single link/prefix may be present, conforming to
        the (1,1,1) or (1,n,1) NEMO multihoming scenarios
        <xref target="RFC4980"/>.</t>

        <t>In some modes of spacecraft operation, all communications may go
        through a single onboard computer (or a Command and Data Handling
        system as on the International Space Station) rather than directly to
        the MNNs themselves, so there is only ever one MNN behind an MR that
        is in direct contact with off-board CNs. In this case, removing the MR
        and using simple host-based Mobile IPv6 rather than NEMO is possible.
        However, an MR is more desirable because it could be part of a modular
        communications adapter that is used in multiple diverse missions to
	bridge onboard buses and intelligently manage space links.  This
        is cheaper and leads to faster development time
        than re&nbhy;creating these capabilities per-mission if using simple Mobile
        IPv6 with a single Command and Data Handling node that varies widely
        between spacecraft. Also, all visions for the future involve
        network-centric operations where the direct addressability and
        accessibility of end devices and data is crucial. As network-centric
        operations become more prevalent, application of NEMO is likely to be
        needed to increase the flexibility of data flow.</t>

        <t>The MRs and MNNs on board a spacecraft are highly customized
        computing platforms, and adding custom code or complex configurations
        in order to obtain NEMO RO capabilities is feasible, although it
        should not be assumed that any amount of code or configuration
        maintenance is possible after launch. The RO scheme as it is initially
        configured should continue to function throughout the lifetime of an
        asset.</t>

        <t>For manned space flight, additional MNNs on spacesuits and
        astronauts may be present and used for applications like two-way voice
        conversation or video-downlink. These MNNs could be reusable and
        reconfigured per-flight for different craft or mission network
        designs, but it is still desirable for them to be able to
        autoconfigure themselves, and they may move between nested or
        non-nested MRs during a mission. For instance, if astronauts move
        between two docked spacecrafts, each craft may have its own local MR
        and wireless coverage that the suit MNNs will have to reconfigure for.
        It is desirable if an RO solution can respond appropriately to this
        change in locality and not cause high levels of packet loss during
        the transitional period. It is also likely that these MNNs will be
        part of Personal Area Networks (PANs), and so may appear either
        directly as MNNs behind the main MR on board or have their own
        MR within the PAN and thus create a nested (or even multi-level
        nested) NEMO configuration.</t>

    <section anchor="required" title="Required Characteristics">
      <t>This section lists requirements that specify the absolute minimal
      technical and/or functional properties that a NEMO RO mechanism must
      possess to be usable for aeronautical and space communications.</t>

      <t>In the recent work done by the International Civil Aviation
      Organization (ICAO) to identify viable mobility technologies for
      providing IP services to aircraft, a set of technical criteria was
      developed (<xref target="aviationreq"></xref>, <xref
      target="ICAO-WP1206"></xref>). The nine required characteristics listed
      in this document can be seen as directly descended from these ICAO
      criteria, except here we have made them much more specific and focused
      for the NEMO technology and the problem of RO within NEMO. The
      original ICAO criteria were more general
      and used for comparing the features of different mobility solutions
      (e.g., mobility techniques based on routing protocols versus transport
      protocols versus Mobile IP, etc.). Within the text describing each
      requirement in this section, we provide the high-level ICAO criteria
      from which it evolved.</t>
 
      <t>These requirements for aeronautics are generally similar to or in
      excess of the requirements for space exploration, so we do not add any
      additional requirements specifically for space exploration. In addition,
      the lack of a standards body regulating performance and safety
      requirements for space exploration means that the requirements for
      aviation are much easier to agree upon and base within existing
      requirements frameworks. After consideration, we believe that the set of
      aviation-based requirements outlined here also fully suffices for space
      exploration.</t>
	 
      <t>It is understood that different solutions may be needed for
      supporting different domains.  This may mean either different
      NEMO RO solutions or different mobility solutions entirely.
      Divergent solutions amongst the domains are acceptable, though
      preferably avoided if possible.</t>

      <t>An underlying requirement that would be assumed by the use of
      Mobile IP technology for managing mobility (rather than a
      higher-layer approach) is that IP addresses used both within the
      mobile network and by CNs to start new sessions with nodes
      within the mobile network remain constant throughout the course
      of flights and operations.  For ATS and AOS, this allows the
      Home Addresses (HoAs) to serve as node identifiers, rather than just locators, and for
      PIES it allows common persistent applications (e.g., Voice over IP (VoIP) clients, VPN
      clients, etc.) to remain connected throughout a flight.  Prior
      aeronautical network systems like the prior OSI-based ATN and Connexion by Boeing set
      a precedent for keeping a fixed Mobile Network Prefix (MNP),
      though they relied on interdomain
      routing protocols (IDRP and BGP) to accomplish this, rather than
      NEMO technology.  This requirement applies to the selection in
      general of a mobility management technology, and not specifically to an RO
      solution once NEMO has been decided on for mobility management.</t>

      <section title="Req1 - Separability">
	<t>
		Since RO may be inappropriate for some flows, an RO scheme
		MUST support configuration by a per-domain, dynamic RO policy
		database.  Entries in this database can be similar to those used
		in IPsec security policy databases in order to specify either
		bypassing or utilizing RO for specific flows.
	</t>

    <section title="Rationale for Aeronautics - Separability">
	    <t>
	    Even if RO is available to increase the performance of a mobile
	    network's traffic, it may not be appropriate for all flows.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	    There may also be a desire to push certain flows through the
	    MRHA path, rather than performing RO, to enable them to be easily
	    recorded by a central service.  
	    </t>

	    <t>
	    For these reasons, an RO scheme must have the ability to be
	    bypassed by applications that desire to use bidirectional
	    tunnels through an HA. This desire could be expressed
	    through a policy database similar to the security policy
	    database used by IPsec, for instance, but the specific
	    means of signaling or configuring the expression of this
	    desire by applications is left as a detail for the specific
	    RO specifications.
    	    </t>

	    <t>
	    In addition, it is expected that the use of NEMO technology be
	    decided on a per-domain basis, so that it is possible that, for
	    some domains, separate MRs or even non-NEMO mobility
	    techniques are used.  This requirement for an RO policy database only
	    applies to domains that utilize NEMO.
    	    </t>

            <t>This requirement was derived from ICAO's TC-1
            <xref target="Davis06" /> - "The approach
            should provide a means to define data communications that can be
            carried only over authorized paths for the traffic type and category
	    specified by the user."</t>

	    <t>
	    One suggested approach to traffic separation is multi-addressing of
	    the onboard networks, with treatment of a traffic domain determined
	    by the packet addresses used.  However, there are other techniques
	    possible for meeting this requirement, and so multi-addressing is
	    not itself a requirement.  The Req1 requirement we describe above
	    is intended for separating the traffic within a domain that makes
	    use of NEMO based on flow properties (e.g., short messaging flows
	    vs. longer file transfers or voice flows).
    	    </t>

         </section>
     </section> 

      <section title="Req2 - Multihoming">
	<t>
	An RO solution MUST support an MR having multiple interfaces and
	MUST allow a given domain to be bound to a specific interface.  It
	MUST be possible to use different MNPs for different domains.
	</t>

	<section title="Rationale for Aeronautics - Multihoming">
        <t>Multiple factors drive a requirement for multihoming capabilities.
        For ATS safety-of-life critical traffic, the need for high
        availability suggests a basic multihoming requirement. The regulatory
        and operational difficulty in deploying new systems and transitioning
        away from old ones also implies that a mix of access technologies may
        be in use at any given time, and may require simultaneous use. Another
        factor is that the multiple domains of applications on board may
        actually be restricted in what data links they are allowed to use,
        based on regulations and policy; thus, at certain times or locations,
        PIES data flows may have to use distinct access links from those used
        by ATS data flows.</t>

        <t>This drives the requirement that an RO solution MUST allow for an
        MR to be connected to multiple access networks simultaneously and have
        multiple CoAs in use simultaneously. The selection of a proper CoA and
        access link to use per-packet may be either within or outside the
        scope of the RO solution. As a minimum, if an RO solution is
        integrable with the MONAMI6 basic extensions (i.e.,
        registration of multiple CoAs and flow bindings) and does not
        preclude their use, then this requirement can be considered to
        be satisfied.</t>

        <t>It is not this requirement's intention that an RO scheme itself
        provide multihoming, but rather simply to exclude RO techniques whose
	use is not possible in multihomed scenarios.</t>

	<t>In terms of NEMO multihoming scenarios
	<xref target="RFC4980"/>, it MUST be possible to support at
	least the (n,1,n) and (n,n,n) scenarios.</t>

        <t>This requirement was derived from ICAO's TC-2 - "The approach
        should enable an aircraft to both roam between and to be
        simultaneously connected to multiple independent air-ground
        networks."</t>
	</section>
      </section>



	<section title="Req3 - Latency">
	<t>
	While an RO solution is in the process of setting up or
	reconfiguring, packets of specified flows MUST be capable
	of using the MRHA tunnel.
	</t>

     	<section title="Rationale for Aeronautics - Latency">
        <t>It is possible that an RO scheme may take longer to set up or
        involve more signaling than the basic NEMO MRHA tunnel maintenance
        that occurs during an update to the MR's active CoAs when the set of
        usable access links changes. During this period of flux, it may be
        important for applications to be able to immediately get packets onto
        the ground network, especially considering that connectivity may have
        been blocked for some period of time while link-layer and NEMO
        procedures for dealing with the transition occurred. Also, when an
        application starts for the first time, the RO scheme may not have
        previous knowledge related to the CN and may need to perform some
        set up before an optimized path is available. If the RO scheme blocks
        packets either through queueing or dropping while it is configuring
        itself, this could result in unacceptable delays.</t>

        <t>Thus, when transitions in the MR's set of active access links
        occurs, the RO scheme MUST NOT block packets from using the MRHA
        tunnel if the RO scheme requires more time to set up or configure
        itself than the basic NEMO tunnel maintenance. Additionally, when an
        application flow is started, the RO scheme MUST allow packets to
        immediately be sent, perhaps without the full benefit of RO, if the RO
        scheme requires additional time to configure a more optimal path to
        the CN.</t>

        <t>This requirement was derived from ICAO's TC-3 - "The approach
        should minimize latency during establishment of initial paths to an
        aircraft, during handoff, and during transfer of individual data
	packets."</t>
	</section>
      </section>

      <section title="Req4 - Availability">
	<t>
	An RO solution MUST be compatible with network redundancy mechanisms
	and MUST NOT prevent fallback to the MRHA tunnel if an element in an
	optimized path fails.<vspace blankLines="1"/>
	An RO mechanism MUST NOT add any new single point of failure for
	communications in general.
	</t>	


        <section title="Rationale for Aeronautics - Availability">
        <t>A need for high availability of connectivity to ground networks
            arises from the use of IP networking for carrying safety-of-life
            critical traffic. For this reason, single points of failure need to
            be avoided. If an RO solution assumes either a single onboard MR, a
            single HA, or some similar vulnerable point, and is not usable when
            the network includes standard reliability mechanisms for routers,
            then the RO technique will not be acceptable. An RO solution also
            MUST NOT itself imply a single point of failure.</t>

        <t> This requirement specifies that the RO solution itself does not
            create any great new fragility.  Although in basic Mobile IPv6 and
            NEMO deployments, the use of a single HA implies a single point of
            failure, there are mechanisms enabling the redundancy of HAs (e.g.,
            <xref target="RELIABILITY"/>).  It is assumed that
            some HA-redundancy techniques would be employed to increase
            robustness in an aeronautical setting.  It should also be
            understood that the use of RO techniques decreases dependence on
            HAs in the infrastructure and allows a certain level of robustness
            to HA failures in that established sessions using RO may be able to
            operate based on Binding Cache entries even after an HA failure.
            With RO, an HA failure primarily impacts the ability to connect new
            application flows to a mobile network.</t>

        <t> If a failure occurs in a path selected by an RO technique, then
            that RO technique MUST NOT prevent fallback to the MRHA path for
            affected traffic.  </t>

        <t>This does not mention specific redundancy mechanisms for MRs, HAs,
            or other networking elements, so as long as some reasonable method
            for making each component redundant fits within the assumptions of
            the RO mechanism, this requirement can be considered satisfied.</t>

        <t>There is no intention to support "Internet-less" operation through
            this requirement. When an MR is completely disconnected from the
            majority of the network with which it is intended to communicate, including
            its HA, there is no requirement for it to be able to retain any
            communications involving parties outside the mobile networks
            managed by itself.</t>

        <t>This requirement was derived from ICAO's TC-4 - "The approach should
            have high availability which includes not having a single point of
            failure."</t> </section> </section>

     <section title="Req5 - Packet Loss">
        <t>
	An RO scheme SHOULD NOT cause either loss or duplication of data packets
	during RO path establishment, usage, or transition, above that caused
	in the NEMO basic support case.  An RO scheme MUST NOT itself create
	non-transient losses and duplications within a packet stream.
	</t>


        <section title="Rationale for Aeronautics - Packet Loss">
        <t>It is possible that some RO schemes could cause data packets to be
        lost during transitions in RO state or due to unforeseen packet filters
        along the RO-selected path. This could be difficult for an application
        to detect and respond to in time. For this reason, an RO scheme SHOULD
        NOT cause packets to be dropped at any point in operation, when they
	would not normally have been dropped in a non-RO configuration.
        </t>
	
	<t>As an attempt at optimizing against packet loss, some techniques
	may, for some time, duplicate packets sent over both the MRHA tunnel
	and the optimized path.  If this results in duplicate packets being
	delivered to the application, this is also unacceptable.</t>

        <t>This requirement does not necessarily imply make-before-break in
        transitioning between links. The intention is that during the handoff
	period, the RO scheme itself should not produce losses (or duplicates)
	that would not have occurred if RO had been disabled.</t>

        <t>This requirement was derived from ICAO's TC-5 - "The approach
        should not negatively impact end-to-end data integrity, for example,
        by introducing packet loss during path establishment, handoff, or data
	transfer."</t>

	<t>It is understood that this may be a requirement that is not easily
	implementable with regards to RO.  Furthermore Req1,
	Separability, may be sufficient in allowing loss-sensitive and
	duplicate-sensitive flows to take the MRHA path.

        <section title="Req6 - Scalability">
        <t>
		An RO scheme MUST be simultaneously usable by the MNNs on
		hundreds of thousands of craft without overloading the ground
		network or routing system.  This explicitly forbids injection
		of BGP routes into the global Internet for purposes of RO.
	</t>

        <section title="Rationale for Aeronautics - Scalability">
        <t>Several thousand aircraft may be in operation at some time, each
        with perhaps several hundred MNNs onboard. The number of active
        spacecraft using IP will be multiple orders of magnitude smaller than
        this over at least the next decade, so the aeronautical needs are more
        stringent in terms of scalability to large numbers of MRs. It would be
        a non-starter if the combined use of an RO technique by all of the MRs
        in the network caused ground networks provisioned within the realm of
        typical long-haul private telecommunications networks (like the FAA's
        Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) or the NASA Integrated
        Services Network (NISN)) to be overloaded or melt-down under
        the RO signaling load or amount of rapid path changes for
        multiple data flows.</t>

	<t>Thus, an RO scheme MUST be simultaneously usable by the MNNs on
	hundreds of thousands of craft without overloading the ground
	network or routing system.  The scheme must also be tolerant to the
        delay and/or loss of initial packets, which may become more pervasive
        in future Internet routing and addressing architectures <xref target="TAXONOMY"/>.</t>

	<t>
	Since at least one traffic domain (PIES) requires connectivity to
	the Internet and it is possible that the Internet would provide
	transport for other domains at some distant point in the future,
	this requirement explicitly forbids the use of techniques that are
	known to scale poorly in terms of their global effects, like BGP, for
	the purposes of RO.  The previous OSI-based ATN system used IDRP and an
	&quot;island&quot; concept for maintaining connectivity to the mobile
	network but was not tested on a large scale deployment.  The
        Connexion by Boeing system used BGP announces and withdrawals as a
	plane moved across the globe in order to maintain connectivity <xref
	target="Dul05"/>.  This was found to contribute to a
	significant amount of churn in the global Internet routing tables, which
	is undesirable for a number of reasons, and must be avoided in the
	future.</t>

        <t>This requirement was derived from ICAO's TC-6 - "The approach
        should be scaleable to accommodate anticipated levels of aircraft
	equipage."</t>

	<t>The specific scaling factor for the number of aircraft used in our
	version of the requirement is an order of magnitude larger than
	the estimated equipage cited in an ICAO draft letter-of-intent
	to ARIN for an IPv6 prefix allocation request.  There were
	several other estimates that different groups had made, and it
	was felt in the IETF that using a larger estimate was more
	conservative.  It should be noted that even with this
	difference of an order of magnitude, the raw number is still
	several orders of magnitude lower than that of estimated
	cellular telephone users, which might use the same protocol
	enhancements as the cellular industry has also adopted Mobile IP
	standards.</t>

      <section title="Req7 - Efficient Signaling">
	<t>
	An RO scheme MUST be capable of efficient signaling in terms of both
	size and number of individual signaling messages and the ensemble of
	signaling messages that may simultaneously be triggered by concurrent
	flows.
	</t>

        <section title="Rationale for Aeronautics - Efficient Signaling">
        <t>The amount of bandwidth available for aeronautical and space
        communications has historically been quite small in comparison to the
	desired bandwidth (e.g., in the case of VDL links, the bandwidth is  
	8 kbps of shared resources). This situation is expected to persist for
	at least several more years. Links tend to be provisioned based on 
	estimates of application needs (which could well prove wrong if either demand or
        the applications in use themselves do not follow
        expectations) and do not leave much room for additional
        networking protocol overhead. Since every byte of available
        air-ground link capacity that is used by
        signaling for NEMO RO is likely to delay bytes of application data and
        reduce application throughput, it is important that the NEMO RO
        scheme's signaling overhead scales up much more slowly than the
        throughput of the flows RO is being performed on. This way, as
        higher-rate data links are deployed along with more bandwidth-hungry
        applications, the NEMO RO scheme will be able to safely be discounted
	in capacity planning.</t>

	<t>
	Note that in meeting this requirement, an RO technique must be
	efficient in both the size and number of individual messages that
	it sends, as well in the ensemble of messages sent at one time (for
	instance, to give RO to multiple ongoing flows following a handover), in
	order to prevent storms of packets related to RO.
	</t>

        <t>This requirement was derived from ICAO's TC-7 - "The approach
        should result in throughput which accommodates anticipated levels of
	aircraft equipage."</t>

      <section title="Req8 - Security">
	<t>
	For the ATS/AOS domains, there are three security
	       sub-requirements:<list style="numbers">

	<t>The RO scheme MUST NOT further expose MNPs on the wireless
	link than already is the case for NEMO basic
	support.</t>

	<t>The RO scheme MUST permit the receiver of a binding update (BU) to validate
	an MR's ownership of the CoAs claimed by an MR.</t>

	<t>The RO scheme MUST ensure that only explicitly authorized MRs are
          able to perform a binding update for a specific MNP.</t></list></t>

	<t>For the PIES domain, there are no additional requirements beyond those
	of normal Internet services and the same requirements for normal Mobile
	IPv6 RO apply.
	</t>

	<section title="Rationale for Aeronautics - Security">

	<t>The security needs are fairly similar between ATS and AOS,
	but vary widely between the ATS/AOS domains and PIES.  For
	PIES, the traffic flows are typical of terrestrial Internet use
	and the security requirements for RO are identical to those of
	conventional Mobile IPv6 RO.  For ATS/AOS, however, there are
	somewhat more strict requirements, along with some safe assumptions
	that designers of RO schemes can make.  Below, we describe each of
	these ATS/AOS issues, but do not further discuss PIES RO security.
	</t>

    <t> The first security requirement is driven by concerns expressed by ATS
        communications engineers.  The concern is driven by current air-ground
        links to a craft and their lack of security, which has allowed
        eavesdroppers to track individual flights in detail.  Protecting
        the MNP from exposure has been expressed as a requirement by this
        community, though the security of the RO system should not depend on
        secrecy of the MNP.  The RO scheme should use some reasonable security
        mechanisms in order to both protect RO signaling via strong
        authentication and encrypt the MNP from being visible over air-ground
        links.</t>

    <t>The second security requirement is driven by the risk of flooding
        attacks that are started by an attacker redirecting an MNP's traffic to
        some target victim CoA.  To protect bindings to bogus CoAs from being
        sent, the RO scheme must somehow validate that an MR actually possesses
        any CoAs that it claims.  For the purposes of aeronautics, it is safe
        to assume ingress filtering is in place in the access networks.</t>

    <t>To protect against &quot;rogue&quot; MRs or abuse of compromised MRs,
        the RO scheme MUST be capable of checking that an MR is actually
        authorized to perform a binding update for a specific MNP.  To meet
        this requirement, it can be assumed that some aeronautical organization
        authority exists who can provide the required authorization, possibly
        in the form of a certificate that the MR possesses, signed by the
        aeronautical authority.  </t>

    <t> It is also reasonable to assume trust relationships between each MR
        and a number of mobility anchor points topologically near to its CNs
        (these anchor points may be owned by the service providers), but it is
        not reasonable to assume that trust relationships can be established
        between an MR and any given CN itself.  Within the onboard networks for
        ATS and AOS, it is reasonable to assume that the LFNs and MRs have some
        trust relationship.</t>

    <t>It is felt by many individuals that by the time the IP-based ATN grows
        into production use, there will be a global ATN-specific
        Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) useable
        for ATS, though it is agreed that such a PKI does not currently exist
        and will take time to develop both technically and politically.  This
        PKI could permit the establishment of trust relationships among any
        pair of ATS MNNs, MRs, or CNs through certificate paths, in contrast to
        the more limited amount of trust relationships described in the
        previous paragraph. While it has been suggested that early test and
        demonstration deployments with a more limited-scale PKI deployment can
        be used in the near-term, as a global PKI is developed, some parties
        still feel that assuming a global PKI may be overly bold in comparison
        to assuming trust relationships with anchor points.  It is always
        possible to scale the anchor point assumption up if a PKI develops that
        allows the CNs themselves to become the anchor points.  It is not
        possible to go back down in the other direction if a global PKI never
        emerges.</t>

    <t>This requirement was extrapolated from ICAO's TC-8 - "The approach
        should be secure" and made more specific with help from the MEXT
        working group.  </t>

      <section title="Req9 - Adaptability">
	<t>
	Applications using new transport protocols, IPsec, or new IP options
	MUST be possible within an RO scheme.
	</t>

    <section title="Rationale for Aeronautics - Adaptability"> 

        <t>The concepts of operations are not fully developed for
            network-centric command and control and other uses of IP-based
            networks in aeronautical and space environments. The exact
            application protocols, data flow characteristics, and even
            transport protocols that will be used in either transitional or
            final operational concepts are not completely defined yet, and may
            even change with deployment experience.  The RO solution itself
            should allow all higher-layer protocols, ports, and options to be
            used.</t>

	</section>
      </section>
    </section>


    <section anchor="desirable" title="Desirable Characteristics">
      <t>In this section, we identify some of the properties of the system
      that are not strict requirements due to either being difficult to
      quantify or to being features that are not immediately needed,
      but that may provide additional benefits that would help encourage adoption.</t>

      <section title="Des1 - Configuration">
        <t>For ATS systems, complex configurations are known to increase
        uncertainty in context, human error, and the potential for
        reaching undesirable (unsafe) states <xref target="ICAO-05"></xref>. Since RO
        alters the communications context between an MNN and CN, it is
        desirable that a NEMO RO solution be as simple to configure as
        possible and also easy to automatically disable if an undesirable
        state is reached.</t>

        <t>For CNs at large airports, the Binding Cache state management
        functions may be simultaneously dealing with hundreds of airplanes
        with multiple service providers and a volume of mobility events due
        to arrivals and departures. The ability to have simple interfaces for
        humans to access the Binding Cache configuration and alter it in case
        of errors is desirable, if this does not interfere with the RO
        protocol mechanisms themselves.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Des2 - Nesting">
        <t>It is desirable if the RO mechanism supports RO for nested MRs,
            since it is possible that, for PIES and astronaut spacesuits, 
            PANs with MRs will need to be supported. For oceanic flight, ATS
            and AOS may also benefit from the capability of nesting MRs between
            multiple planes to provide a "reachback" to terrestrial
            ground stations rather than relying solely on lower rate HF or
            satellite systems. In either case, this mode of operation is beyond
            current strict requirements and is merely desirable.  It is also
            noted that there are other ways to support these communications
            scenarios using routing protocols or other means outside of
            NEMO.</t>
 
        <t>Loop-detection, in support of nesting, is specifically not a
            requirement at this stage of ATN and space network designs, due to
            both the expectation that the operational environments are
            carefully controlled and inherently avoid loops and the
            understanding that scenarios involving nesting are not envisioned
            in the near future.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Des3 - System Impact">
        <t>Low complexity in systems engineering and configuration management
        is desirable in building and maintaining systems using the RO
        mechanism. This property may be difficult to quantify, judge, and
        compare between different RO techniques, but a mechanism that is
        perceived to have lower impact on the complexity of the network
        communications system should be favored over an otherwise equivalent
        mechanism (with regards to the requirements listed above). This is
        somewhat different than Des1 (Configuration), in that Des1 refers to
        operation and maintenance of the system once deployed, whereas Des3 is
        concerned with the initial design, deployment, transition, and later
        upgrade path of the system.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Des4 - VMN Support">
        <t>At least LFNs MUST be supported by a viable RO solution
        for aeronautics, as these local nodes are within the ATS and AOS
	domains. If Mobile IPv6 becomes a popular technology used by
	portable consumer devices, VMNs within the PIES domain are expected to
	be numerous, and it is strongly desirable for them to be supported by
	the RO technique, but not strictly required. LMNs are potentially
	present in future space exploration scenarios, such as manned
        exploration missions to the moon and Mars.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Des5 - Generality">
        <t>An RO mechanism that is "general purpose", in that it is also
        readily usable in other contexts outside of aeronautics and space
        exploration, is desirable. For instance, an RO solution that is usable
        within Vehicular ad hoc Networks (VANETs) <xref target="C2CCC-NEMO"></xref> or
        consumer electronics equipment <xref
        target="CE-REQ"></xref> could satisfy this. The goal is
        for the technology to be more widely used and maintained outside the
        relatively small aeronautical networking community and its vendors, in
        order to make acquisitions and training faster, easier, and cheaper.
        This could also allow aeronautical networking to possibly benefit from
        future RO scheme optimizations and developments whose research and
        development is funded and performed externally by the broader industry
        and academic communities.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document does not create any security concerns in and of itself.
      The security properties of any NEMO RO scheme that is to be used in
      aeronautics and space exploration are probably much more stringent than
      for more general NEMO use, due to the safety-of-life and/or national
      security issues involved. The required security properties are described
      under Req8 of <xref target="required"></xref> within this document.</t>

      <t>Under an assumption of closed and secure backbone networks, the
      air-ground link is the weakest portion of the network and most
      susceptible to injection of packets, flooding, and other attacks.
      Future air-ground data links that will use IP are being developed
      with link-layer security as a concern.  This development can assist
      in meeting one of this document's listed security requirements (that
      MNPs not be exposed on the wireless link), but the other requirements
      affect the RO technology more directly without regard to the presence
      or absence of air-ground link-layer security.</t>

      <t>When deploying in operational networks where network-layer security
      may be mandated (e.g., virtual private networks), the interaction between
      this and NEMO RO techniques should be carefully considered to ensure
      that the security mechanisms do not undo the route optimization by
      forcing packets through a less optimal overlay or underlay. For
      instance, when IPsec tunnel use is required, the locations of the tunnel
      endpoints can force sub-optimal end-to-end paths to be taken.</t>

             title="Basics of IP-Based Aeronautical Networking">
      <t>The current standards for aeronautical networking are based on the
      ISO OSI networking stack and are referred to as the Aeronautical
      Telecommunications Network (ATN). While standardized, the ATN has not
      been fully deployed and seems to be in only limited use compared to its
      full vision and potential. The International Civil Aviation Organization
      (ICAO) is a part of the United Nations that produces standards for
      aeronautical communications. The ICAO has recognized that an ATN based
      on OSI lacks the widespread commercial network support required for the
      successful deployment of new, more bandwidth-intensive ATN applications,
      and has recently been working towards a new IPv6-based version of the
      ATN.</t>

      <t>Supporting mobility in an IP-based network may be vastly different
      than it is in the OSI-based ATN, which uses the Inter-Domain Routing
      Protocol (IDRP) to recompute routing tables as mobile networks change
      topological points of attachment. ICAO recognizes this and has studied
      various mobility techniques based on link, network, transport, routing,
      and application protocols <xref target="ICAO-WP1206"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Work done within ICAO has identified the NEMO technology as a
      promising candidate for use in supporting global, IP-based mobile
      networking. The main concerns with NEMO have been with its current lack
      of route optimization support and its potentially complex configuration
      requirements in a large airport environment with multiple service
      providers and 25 or more airlines sharing the same infrastructure.</t>

      <t>A significant challenge to the deployment of networking technologies
      to aeronautical users is the low capability of existing air-ground
      data links for carrying IP-based (or other) network traffic.  Due to
      barriers of spectrum and certification, production of new standards and
      equipment for the lower layers below IP is slow.  Currently operating
      technologies may have data rates measured in the several kbps range, and
      it is clear that supporting advanced IP-based applications will require
      new link technologies to be developed simultaneously with the development
      of networking technologies appropriate for aeronautics.</t>

      <t>In addition to well-known commercial data links that can be
      adapted for aeronautical use, such as Wideband Code-Division
      Multiple Access (WCDMA) standards or the IEEE 802.16 standard,
      several more specialized technologies either exist or have been
      proposed for air-ground use:

          <list style="symbols">

      <t>VHF Data Link (VDL) specifies four modes of operation in the 117.975 -
          137 MHz range that are capable of supporting different mixes of digital voice
          and data at fairly low rates.  The low rates are driven by the need
          to operate within 25 kHz channels internationally allocated for
          aeronautical use.  
          VDL mode 2 is somewhat widely deployed on aircraft
          and two global service providers support VDL access networks.
          Experiences with VDL mode 2 indicate that several kbps of capacity
          delivered to a craft can be expected in practice, and the use of long
          timers and a collision avoidance algorithm over a large physical
          space (designed to operate at 200 nautical miles) limit the
          performance of IP-based transport protocols and applications.</t>

      <t>Aircraft Communications and Reporting System (ACARS) is a messaging
          system that can be used over several types of underlying RF
          data links (e.g., VHF, HF, and satellite relay).  ACARS messaging
          automates the sending and processing of several types of event notifications over
          the course of a flight.  ACARS in general is a higher-level messaging
          system, whereas the more specific "Plain Old ACARS" (POA) refers to a
          particular legacy RF interface that the ACARS system employed prior
          to the adoption of VDL and other data links.  Support for IP-based
          networking and advanced applications over POA is not feasible.</t>

      <t>Broadband Aeronautical Multi-carrier Communications (B-AMC) is a
          hybrid cellular system that uses multi-carrier CDMA from
          ground-to-air and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
          (OFDM) in the air-to-ground direction.  B-AMC runs in
          the L-band of spectrum and is adapted from the Broadband-VHF (B-VHF)
          technology originally developed to operate in the VHF spectrum.
          L-band use is intended to occupy the space formerly allocated for
          Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) using channels with greater
          bandwidth than are available than in the VHF band, where analog voice
          use will continue to be supported.  B-AMC may permit substantially
          higher data rates than existing deployed air-ground links.</t>

      <t>All-Purpose Multi-Channel Aviation Communications System (AMACS) is an
          adaptation of the Global System for Mobile Communications
          (GSM) physical layer to operate in the L-band with 50
          - 400 kHz channels and use VDL mode 4's media access technique.
          AMACS may permit data rates in the several hundred kbps range,
          depending on specific channelization policies deployed.</t>

      <t>Project 34 (P34) is a wideband public-safety radio system capable of
          being used in the L-band.  P34 is designed to offer several hundred
          kbps of capacity specifically for IP-based packet networking.  It
          uses OFDM in 50, 100, or 150 kHz channels and exact performance will
          depend on the particular operating band, range (guard time), and
          channelization plan configured in deployment.</t>

      <t>L-Band Data Link (LDL) is another proposal using the L-band based on
          existing technologies.  LDL adapts the VDL mode 3 access technique
	  and is expected to be capable of up to 100 kbps.</t>

      <t>IP itself is only in limited operational use for communicating with
      spacecraft currently (e.g., the Surry Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL)
      Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) satellites).
      Future communications architectures include IP-based networking as an
      essential building block, however. The Consultative Committee for Space
      Data Systems (CCSDS) has a working group that is producing a network
      architecture for using IP-based communications in both manned and
      unmanned near-Earth missions, and has international participation
      towards this goal <xref target="Cislunar07"></xref>. NASA's Space
      Communications Architecture Working Group (SCAWG) also has developed an
      IP-based multi-mission networking architecture <xref
      target="SCAWG-06"></xref>. Neither of these is explicitly based on
      Mobile IP technologies, but NEMO is usable within these architectures
      and they may be extended to include NEMO when/if the need becomes
      apparent.</t>
