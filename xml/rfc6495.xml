			<t>SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) defines the Name Type field in
				the ICMPv6 Trust Anchor option. This document specifies new Name Type fields based on certificate Subject Key
				Identifiers (SKIs).</t>

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>
				SEcure Neighbor Discovery
				(SEND) <xref target='RFC3971' /> utilizes X.509v3 certificates that include the
				<xref target="RFC3779"></xref>
				extension for IPv6 addresses to certify a router&apos;s authority over an
				IPv6 prefix for the NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol). The Trust Anchor (TA)
				option in Section 6.4.3 of <xref target='RFC3971' /> allows the identification of the
			Trust Anchor selected by the host. In that same section, two
				name types were defined: the DER Encoded X.501 Name and a Fully
				Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). 
			</t>
			<t>In any Public Key Infrastructure, the subject name of a
				certificate is only unique within each
Certification Authority (CA). Consequently, a new
				option to identify TAs across CAs is needed.</t>
			<t>
				In <xref target="RFC6494" />, the certificate profile described in
				<xref target="RFC6487" />
				is adopted for SEND. In these documents, the Subject field in the
				certificates is declared to be meaningless and the subjectAltName
				field is not allowed. On the other hand, the Subject Key Identifier
				(SKI) extension for the X.509 certificates is defined as mandatory
				and non-critical.
			</t>
			<t>This document specifies new Name Type fields in the SEND TA
				option that allows the use of the SKI X.509 extension to identify TA
				X.509 certificates. This document also defines experimental and reserved Name Types values.</t>
			<t>Finally, this document updates <xref
target='RFC3971' /> by changing the "Trust Anchor option (Type 15) Name Type
field" registration procedures from Standards Action to Standards Action or
IESG Approval <xref target='RFC5226' />.

		<section title="Requirements Notation">
			<t>
				The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
				"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
				document are to be interpreted as described in
				<xref target="RFC2119" />.

		<section title="Name Type Fields in the ICMPv6 TA Option Defined in This Document" anchor="SEND_SKI">
		<t></t>
			<t>The following Name Type fields in the ICMPv6 TA option are defined:</t>
			<figure>
			<artwork>
	Name Type      Description
	 0		Reserved
	 3		SHA-1 Subject Key Identifier (SKI)
	 4		SHA-224 Subject Key Identifier (SKI)
	 5		SHA-256 Subject Key Identifier (SKI)
	 6		SHA-384 Subject Key Identifier (SKI)
	 7		SHA-512 Subject Key Identifier (SKI)
	 253-254	Experimental
	 255		Reserved
			</artwork>
			</figure>
			<t>Name Type field values 0 and 255 are marked as reserved. This means that they are not available for allocation.</t>
			<t>When the Name Type field is set to 3, the Name Type
field contains a 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the value of the DER-encoded ASN.1 bit
string of the subject public key, as described in Section 4.8.2 of <xref
target="RFC6487" />. Implementations MAY support SHA-1 SKI name type.</t>
			<t>When the Name Type field is set to 4, 5, 6, or 7,
the hash function will respectively be: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, or
SHA-512. Implementations MAY support SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 SKI
name types.
</t> 
			<t>Name Type fields 253 and 254 are marked as
experimental, per guidance in <xref target='RFC3692' />. 
</t> 
		</section>
			<section title="Processing Rules for Routers">
				<t>As specified in <xref target='RFC3971' />, a TA is identified by the SEND TA
					option. If the TA option is represented as a SKI, then the
					SKI MUST be equal to the X.509 SKI extension in the trust anchor's
					certificate. The router SHOULD include the TA
					option(s) in the advertisement for which the certification path was
					found. Also, following the 
specification defined in <xref target='RFC3971' />, if the router is 
					unable to find a path to the requested anchor, it SHOULD send an
					advertisement without any certificate. In this case, the router
					SHOULD include the TA options that were solicited.</t>
		</section>
		<section title="IANA Considerations">
			<t>IANA has updated the "Trust Anchor option (Type 15)
Name Type field" registry to include the following values:</t>  
	
			<texttable anchor="TA registry"
				title="New Name Type Field Values in the ICMPv6 TA Option">
				<ttcol align='left'>Value</ttcol>

				<c>255</c>
				<c>Reserved (<xref target="SEND_SKI" />)</c>
			</texttable>
			<t>IANA has also modified the registration procedures
for the "Trust Anchor option (Type 15) Name Type field" registry to Standards
Action or IESG Approval <xref target='RFC5226' />.</t> 
		</section>
		<section title="Security Considerations">
			<t>The hash functions referenced in this document to
calculate the SKI have reasonable random properties in order to provide
reasonably unique identifiers. Two identical identifiers in the same validation
path will cause the router to stop fetching certificates once the first
certificate has been fetched. In the case that the upward certificate was
configured as a TA by a host, the router will send to this host an incomplete
list of certificates, causing the SEND validation to fail.</t> 
			<t>For experimental values of the Name Type field, the guidance given in <xref target='RFC3692' /> about the use of experimental values needs to be followed.

<t>IPv6 nodes use the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) to discover other nodes on the link, to determine their link-layer addresses to find routers, and to maintain reachability information about the paths to active neighbors.  If not secured, NDP is vulnerable to various attacks.  This document specifies security mechanisms for NDP.  Unlike those in the original NDP specifications, these mechanisms do not use IPsec.
