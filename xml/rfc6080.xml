                This document specifies a framework to enable configuration of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) user agents (UAs) in SIP deployments. The framework provides a means to deliver profile data that user agents need to be functional, automatically and with minimal or no User and Administrative intervention. The framework describes how SIP user agents can discover sources, request profiles, and receive notifications related to profile modifications.  As part of this framework, a new SIP event package is defined for notification of profile changes. The framework provides minimal data retrieval options to ensure interoperability. The framework does not include specification of the profile data within its scope.

        <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
                <t>
                SIP user agents require configuration data to function properly. Examples include information specific to local networks, devices, and users. A configuration data set specific to an entity is termed a profile. For example, device profile contains the configuration data related to a device. The process of providing devices with one or more profiles is termed "profile delivery". Ideally, this profile delivery process should be automatic and require minimal or no user intervention. 
                </t><t>
                Many deployments of SIP user agents require dynamic configuration and cannot rely on pre-configuration. This framework provides a standard means of providing dynamic configuration that simplifies deployments containing SIP user agents from multiple vendors. This framework also addresses change notifications when profiles change. However, the framework does not define the content or format of the profile, leaving that to future standardization activities.
                </t><t>
This document is organized as follows. The normative requirements are contained in Section 5 (framework operations) and Section 6 (the event package definition). The rest of the document provides introductory and supporting explanations. Section 3 provides a high-level overview of the abstract components, profiles, and the profile delivery stages. Section 4 provides some motivating use cases. Section 7 follows with illustrative examples of the framework in use.

                <t>
			This section provides an overview of the configuration framework. It presents the reference model, the motivation, the profile delivery stages, and a mapping of the concepts to specific use cases. It is meant to serve as a reference section for the document, rather than providing a specific logical flow of material, and it may be necessary to revisit these sections for a complete appreciation of the framework. 
</t><t>
                        The SIP UA Profile Delivery Framework uses a
combination of SIP event messages (SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY; <xref
target="RFC3265"/>) and traditional file retrieval protocols, such as HTTP
<xref target="RFC2616"/>, to discover, monitor, and retrieve configuration
profiles. The framework defines three types of profiles (local-network, device, and user) in order to separate aspects of the configuration that may be independently managed by different administrative domains. The initial SUBSCRIBE message for each profile allows the UA to describe itself (both its implementation and the identity requesting the profile), while requesting access to a profile by type, without prior knowledge of the profile name or location. Discovery mechanisms are specified to help the UA form the Subscription URI (the Request-URI for the SIP SUBSCRIBE). The SIP User Agent Server (UAS) handling these subscriptions is the Profile Delivery Server (PDS). When the PDS accepts a subscription, it sends a NOTIFY to the device. The initial NOTIFY from the PDS for each profile may contain profile data or a reference to the location of the profile, to be retrieved using HTTP or similar file retrieval protocols. By maintaining a subscription to each profile, the UA will receive additional NOTIFY messages if the profile is later changed. These may contain a new profile, a reference to a new profile, or a description of profile changes, depending on the Content-Type <xref target="RFC3261"/> in use by the subscription. The framework describes the mechanisms for obtaining three different profile types, but does not describe the data model they utilize (the data model is out of scope for this specification).
               </t>

                <section anchor="ReferenceModel" title="Reference Model">
                        <t>
                        The design of the framework was the result of a careful analysis to identify the configuration needs of a wide range of SIP deployments. As such, the reference model provides for a great deal of flexibility, while breaking down the interactions to their basic forms, which can be reused in many different scenarios. 
                        </t><t>
                        The reference model for the framework defines the interactions between the Profile Delivery Server (PDS) and the device. The device needs the profile data to function effectively in the network. The PDS is responsible for responding to device requests and providing the profile data. The reference model is illustrated in <xref target="FrameworkReferenceModel"/>.

		<section anchor="Motivation" title="Motivation">

			The motivation for the framework can be demonstrated by applying the reference model presented in <xref target="ReferenceModel"/> to two scenarios that are representative of the two ends of a spectrum of potential SIP deployments.
                        </t><t>
                        
                        In the simplest deployment scenario, a device connects
through a network that is controlled by a single provider who provides the
local network, manages the devices, and offers services to the users. The
provider propagates profile data to the device that contains all the necessary
information to obtain services in the network (including information related to
the local network and the users). This is illustrated in <xref target="SimpleDeploymentModel"/>. An example is a simple enterprise network that supports SIP-based devices.

		<t>
                In more complex deployments, devices connect via a local
network that is not controlled by the SIP service provider, such as devices
that connect via available public WiFi hot spots. In such cases, local network providers may wish to provide local network information such as bandwidth constraints to the devices. 
                                </t><t>
                Devices may also be controlled by device providers that are independent of the SIP service provider who provides user services, such as kiosks that allow users to access services from remote locations. In such cases, the profile data may have to be obtained from different profile sources: local network provider, device provider, and SIP service provider. This is indicated in <xref target="ComplexDeploymentModel"/>.

		<t>
		In either case, Providers need to deliver to the device, profile data that is required to participate in their network. Examples of profile data include the list of codecs that can be used and the SIP proxies to which to connect for services. Pre-configuration of such information is one option if the device is always served by the same set of Providers. In all other cases, the profile delivery needs to be automated and consistent across Providers. Given the presence of a number of large deployments where pre-configuration is neither desired nor optimal, there is a need for a common configuration framework such as the one described in this document.

		Further, the former deployment model can be accomplished by the device obtaining profile data from a single provider. However, the latter deployment model requires the device to obtain profile data from different providers. To address either deployment or any variation in between, one needs to allow for profile delivery via one or more Providers. The framework accomplishes this by specifying multiple profile types and a set of profile delivery stages to obtain them. These are introduced in the subsections to follow.

			The framework handles the presence of potentially different Providers by allowing for multiple profile types. Clients request each profile separately, and obtain them from the same, or different, Providers. A deployment can also choose to pre-configure the device to request only a subset of the specified profile types. The framework specifies three basic profile types, as follows:

                        The framework specified in this document requires a device to explicitly request profiles. It also requires one or more PDSs, which provide the profile data. The processes that lead a device to obtain profile data, and any subsequent changes, can be explained in three stages, termed the profile delivery stages.

The examples in this framework tend to associate devices with entities that are accessible to end-users.  However, this is not necessarily the only type of device that can utilize the specified framework.  Devices can be entities such as SIP Phones or soft clients, with or without user interfaces (that allow for device configuration), entities in the network that do not directly communicate with any users (e.g., gateways, media servers, etc.) or network infrastructure elements (e.g., SIP servers). The framework is extensible for use with such device types. However, it is to be noted that some of these other device types (e.g., network elements) may also be configurable using other mechanisms. The use of this framework in conjunction with other mechanisms (specified outside of this document), is out of scope.

			Description: Consider a deployment scenario (e.g., a small private enterprise) where a participating device implements this framework and is configured, using previously obtained profile data, to request only the device profile. Assume that the device operates in the same network as the PDS (i.e., there is no NAT) and it obtains its IP configuration using DHCP. Typical communication between the device and the PDS will traverse one or more SIP proxies, but is not required, and is omitted in this illustration.

<xref target="UseCase1"/> illustrates the sequence of events that includes device start-up and a successful profile enrollment for the device profile that results in device profile data. It then illustrates how a change in the profile data is delivered via Profile Change Notification.

The device MUST transmit the SIP SUBSCRIBE message via configured outbound proxies for the destination domain, or in accordance with RFC 3263 <xref target="RFC3263"/>. 
                                                <vspace blankLines='1' />
						The device needs certain data to create an enrollment request, form a Request-URI, and authenticate to the network. This includes the profile provider's domain name and device or user identities and credentials. Such data can be "configured" during device manufacturing, by the user, or via profile data enrollment (see <xref target="IdentitiesAndCredentials"/>). The data can also be "discovered" using the procedures specified by this framework. The "discovered" data can be retained across device resets (but not across factory resets) and such data is referred to as "cached". Thus, data can be configured, discovered, or cached. The following requirements apply. 

                                                <list style="symbols">

								If the device is configured with a specific domain name (for the local network provider or device provider), it MUST NOT attempt "discovery" of the domain name. This is the case when the device is pre-configured (e.g., via a user interface) to be managed by specific entities.

As an example, when the device is requesting a local-network profile in the domain 'example.net', it cannot present a user Address of Record (AoR) associated with the local domain 'example.com'.

This can result in temporary, one-time data to bootstrap the device. Such temporary data is not considered to be "configured" and SHOULD NOT be cached across resets. The configuration obtained using such data MAY provide the configuration data required for the device to continue functioning normally.

                                                A PDS or a SIP proxy will receive a transmitted enrollment request. If a SIP infrastructure element receives the request, it will relay it to the authoritative proxy for the domain indicated in the Request-URI (the same way it would handle any other SUBSCRIBE message). The authoritative proxy is required to examine the request (e.g., event package) and transmit it to a PDS capable of addressing the profile enrollment request.

An exception to responding or proxying the request is when a policy prevents response (e.g., recognition of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, an invalid device, etc.). The PDS then verifies the identity presented in the request and performs any necessary authentication. Once authentication is successful, the PDS MUST either admit or reject the enrollment request, based on applicable authorization policies. A PDS admitting the enrollment request indicates it via a 2xx-class response, as specified in <xref target="RFC3265"/>.

					A successful profile enrollment leads to an initial SIP notification, and may result in subsequent change notifications. Each of these notifications can either contain profile data or content indirection information. If it contains content indirection information, the device is required to retrieve the profile data using the specified content retrieval protocols. This process is termed "profile content retrieval". For information regarding the use of the SIP NOTIFY message body, please refer to <xref target="NOTIFYBodies"/>.

                                Profile data can change over time. Changes can be initiated by various entities (e.g., via the device, back-office components, and end-user web interfaces) and for various reasons (e.g., change in user preferences and modifications to services). Profiles may also be shared by multiple devices simultaneously. When a profile is changed, the PDS MUST inform all the devices currently enrolled for the specific profile. This process of informing a device of any changes to the profile that it is currently enrolled for is termed change notification.

                                The PDS provides change notification using a SIP notification (the SIP NOTIFY message, as specified in <xref target="RFC3265"/>). The SIP notification may provide the changes, a revised profile, or content indirection, which contains a pointer to the revised data. When a device successfully receives a profile change notification for an enrolled profile, it MUST act upon the changes prior to the expiration of the 'effective-by' parameter.

                                The requirements for the contents of the SIP SUBSCRIBE used to request profile enrollment are described in this section. The data required can be configured, cached, or discovered -- depending on the profile type. If the data is not configured, the device MUST use relevant cached data or proceed with data discovery. This section describes the requirements for creating a SIP SUBSCRIBE for enrollment, the caching requirements and how data can be discovered.

                                To create a Subscription URI to request the
local-network profile, a device needs the local network domain name, the device
identifier, and optionally a user AoR with associated credentials (if one is
configured). Since the device can be potentially initialized in a different
local network each time, it SHOULD NOT cache the local network domain, the SIP Subscription URI or the local-network profile data across resets. An exception to this is when the device can confirm that it is reinitialized in the same network (using means outside the scope of this document). Thus, in most cases, the device needs to discover the local network domain name. The device discovers this by establishing IP connectivity in the local network (such as via DHCP or pre-configured IP information). Once established, the device MUST attempt to use the local network domain obtained via pre-configuration, if available. If it is not pre-configured, it MUST employ dynamic discovery using DHCPv4 (<xref target="RFC2132"/>, Domain Name option) or DHCPv6 (<xref target="RFC4704"/>).  Once the local network domain is obtained, the device creates the SIP SUBSCRIBE for enrollment as described below.
                                <list style="symbols">
                                        <t>
                                        The device MUST NOT populate the user part of the Request-URI. The device MUST set the host portion of the Request-URI to the dot-separated concatenation of "_sipuaconfig" and the local network domain (see example below).
                                        </t>

                                        <t>
                                        If the device has been configured with a user AoR for the local network domain (verified as explained in <xref target="SecuringProfileDelivery"/>) the device MUST use it to populate the From field, unless configured not to (due to privacy concerns, for example). Otherwise, the device MUST set the From field to a value of "anonymous@anonymous.invalid".
                                        </t>

                                        The device MUST include the +sip.instance parameter within the Contact header, as specified in <xref target="RFC5626"/>. The device MUST ensure that the value of this parameter is the same as that included in any subsequent profile enrollment request.
                                        </t>

                                </list>

                                 For example, if the device requested and received the local domain name via DHCP to be: airport.example.net, then the local-network profile SUBSCRIBE Request-URI would look like: 

                                </t><t>
                                sip:_sipuaconfig.airport.example.net
                                </t><t>

                               The local-network profile SUBSCRIBE Request-URI does not have a user part so that the URI is distinct between the "local" and "device" URIs when the domain is the same for the two.  This provides a means of routing to the appropriate PDS in domains where there are distinct servers.  
                                </t><t>
                               
                                The From field is populated with the user AoR, if available. This allows the local network provider to propagate user-specific profile data, if available. The "+sip.instance" parameter within the Contact header is set to the device identifier or specifically, the SIP UA instance. Even though every device may get the same (or similar) local-network profile, the uniqueness of the "+sip.instance" parameter provides an important capability.  Having unique instance ID fields allows the management of the local network to track devices present in the network and consequently also manage resources such as bandwidth allocation.

					       Once associated with a device, the device provider is not expected to change frequently. Thus, the device is allowed to, and SHOULD, cache the Subscription URI for the device profile upon successful enrollment. Exceptions include cases where the device identifier has changed (e.g., new network card), device provider information has changed (e.g., user initiated change), or the device cannot obtain its profile using the Subscription URI. Thus, when available, the device MUST use a cached Subscription URI. If no cached URI is available then it needs to create a Subscription URI. To create a Subscription URI, the device needs a device identity and the device provider's domain name. Unless already configured, the device needs to discover the necessary information and form the Subscription URI.

This will allow for easy recognition, and uniqueness of MAC-address-based UUIDs. An exception is the case where the device supports independent device configuration for more than one SIP UA. An example would be multiple SIP UAs on the same platform.

					To create a Subscription URI to request the user profile on behalf of a user, the device needs to know the user's AoR. This can be statically or dynamically configured on the device (e.g., user input, or propagated as part of the device profile). Similar to device profiles, the content and propagation of user profiles may differ, based on deployment scenarios (i.e., users belonging to the same domain may -- or may not -- be provided the same profile). To create a Subscription URI, the following rules apply:

				Profile data can contain sensitive information that needs to be secured, such as identities and credentials. Security involves authentication, data integrity and data confidentiality. Authentication is the process by which you verify that an entity is who it claims to be, such as a user AoR presented during profile enrollment. Message integrity provides the assurance that the message contents transmitted between two entities, such as between the PDS and the device, has not been modified during transit. Privacy ensures that the message contents have not been subjected to monitoring by unwanted elements during transit. Authentication and data integrity are required to ensure that the profile contents were received by a valid entity, from a valid source, and without any modifications during transit. For profiles that contain sensitive data, data confidentiality is also required. 

                       	</t><t>
			For an overview of potential security threats, refer to <xref target="SecurityConsiderations"/>. For information on how the device can be configured with identities and credentials, refer to <xref target="IdentitiesAndCredentials"/>. The following subsections provide the security requirements associated with each profile delivery stage, and applies to each of profile types specified by this framework.
			</t>

			<section anchor="SecuringProfileEnrollment" title="Securing Profile Enrollment">
				<t>
					Profile enrollment may result in sensitive profile data. In such cases, the PDS MUST authenticate the device, except during the bootstrapping scenario when the device does not have existing credentials (see <xref target="IdentitiesAndCredentials"/> for more information on bootstrapping). Additionally, the device MUST authenticate the PDS to ensure that it is obtaining sensitive profile data from a valid PDS.
                        		</t><t>
					To authenticate a device that has been configured with identities and credentials, as specified in <xref target="IdentitiesAndCredentials"/>, and support profiles containing sensitive profile data (refer to <xref target="ProfileData"/>), devices and PDSs MUST support digest authentication (over Transport Layer Security (TLS)) as specified in <xref target="RFC3261"/>. Future enhancements may provide other authentication methods such as authentication using X.509 certificates. For the device to authenticate the PDS, the device MUST mutually authenticate with the PDS during digest authentication (device challenges the PDS, which responds with the Authorization header). Transmission of sensitive profile data also requires data integrity. This can be accomplished by configuring the device with, or by ensuring that the discovery process during profile enrollment provides, a Session Initiation Protocol Secure (SIPS) URI resulting in TLS establishment (<xref target="RFC5246"/>). TLS also prevents offline dictionary attacks when digest authentication is used. Thus, in the absence of TLS, the device MUST NOT respond to any authentication challenges. It is to be noted that the digest credentials used for obtaining profile data via this framework may, or may not, be the same as those used for SIP registration (see <xref target="IdentitiesAndCredentials"/>). In addition, while <xref target="RFC3261"/> considers MD5 to be a reasonable choice to compute the hash, and this may have been true when <xref target="RFC3261"/> was published, implementers are recommended to use stronger alternatives such as SHA-256. Refer to <xref target="FIPS-180-3"/> and <xref target="RFC4634"/> for more information about SHA-256.
                        		</t><t>
					When the PDS challenges a profile enrollment request, and it fails, the PDS MAY refuse enrollment or provide profile data without the user-specific information (e.g., to bootstrap a device as indicated in <xref target="IdentitiesAndCredentials"/>). If the device challenges, but fails to authenticate the PDS, it MUST reject the initial notification and retry the profile enrollment process. If the device is configured with, or discovers, a SIPS URI but TLS establishment fails because the next-hop SIP entity does not support TLS, the device SHOULD attempt other resolved next-hop SIP entities.  When the device establishes TLS with the next-hop entity, the device MUST use the procedures specified in <xref target="RFC2818"/>, Section 3.1, for authentication, unless it does not have any configured information (e.g., certification authority (CA) certificate) to perform authentication (like prior to bootstrapping). 

The 'Server Identity' for authentication is always the domain of the next-hop SIP entity. If the device attempts validation, and it fails, it MUST reject the initial notification and retry profile enrollment. In the absence of a SIPS URI for the device and a mechanism for mutual authentication, the PDS MUST NOT present any sensitive profile data in the initial notification, except when the device is being bootstrapped. It MAY still use content indirection to transmit sensitive profile data.
					
					</t><t>
					When a device is being provided with bootstrapping profile data within the notification, and it contains sensitive information, the SIP Identity header SHOULD be used, as specified in <xref target="RFC4474"/>. This helps with devices that MAY be pre-configured with certificates to validate bootstrapping sources (e.g., list of allowed domain certificates, or a list of root CA certificates using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)). When the SIP Identity header is used, the PDS MUST set the host portion of the AoR in the From header to the Provider's domain (the user portion is a entity-specific identifier). If the device is capable of validating the SIP Identity, and it fails, it MUST reject bootstrapping profile data.

                                        Initial or change notifications following a successful enrollment can provide a device with the requested profile data or use content indirection to direct it to a PCC that can provide the profile data. This document specifies HTTP and HTTPS as content retrieval protocols. 

                                        </t><t>

					If the profile is provided via content indirection and contains sensitive profile data, then the PDS MUST use a HTTPS URI for content indirection. PCCs and devices MUST NOT use HTTP for sensitive profile data, except for bootstrapping a device via the device profile. A device MUST authenticate the PCC as specified in <xref target="RFC2818"/>, Section 3.1. A device that is being provided with profile data that contains sensitive data MUST be authenticated using digest authentication as specified in <xref target="RFC2617"/>, with the exception of a device that is being bootstrapped for the first time via the device profile. The resulting TLS channel also provides data integrity and data confidentiality.

				If the device requested enrollment via a SIP subscription with a non-zero 'Expires' parameter, it can also result in change notifications for the duration of the subscription. For change notifications containing sensitive profile data, this framework RECOMMENDS the use of the SIP Identity header as specified in <xref target="RFC4474"/>. When the SIP Identity header is used, the PDS MUST set the host portion of the AoR in the From header to the Provider's domain (the user portion is a entity-specific identifier). This provides header and body integrity as well. However, for sensitive profile data requiring data confidentiality , if the contact URI to which the NOTIFY request is to be sent is not SIPS, the PDS MUST use content indirection. Additionally, the PDS MUST also use content indirection for notifications containing sensitive profile data, when the profile enrollment was not authenticated.

                                When requesting a profile, the profile delivery server will likely require the device to provide an identity (i.e., a user AoR) and associated credentials for authentication. During this process (e.g., digest authentication), the PDS is also required to present its knowledge of the credentials to ensure mutual authentication (see <xref target="SecuringProfileEnrollment"/>). For mutual authentication with the PDS, the device needs to be provided with the necessary identities and credentials (e.g., username/password, certificates). This is done via bootstrapping. For a discussion around the security considerations related to bootstrapping, please see <xref target="SCForDeviceProfile"/>.

                                </t><t>

Bootstrapping a device with the required identities and credentials can be accomplished in one of the following ways:

For purposes of bootstrapping, this framework recommends that the device profile provide one of the following to bootstrap the device:

For example, the profile data can direct the end-user to a web portal to obtain a subscription. Upon obtaining a successful subscription, the end-user or the device can be provided with the necessary identities and credentials.

As an example, consider a device that has an X.509 certificate that can be authenticated by the PCC. In such a case, the PCC can use HTTPS to provide identities and associated credentials.

							Profile data containing identities and credentials that can be used to bootstrap the device (see <xref target="ProfileData"/> for profile data recommendations). This can be used in cases where the device is initialized for the first time, or after a factory reset. This can be considered only in cases where the device is initialized in the Provider's network, for obvious security reasons.

				For interoperability purposes, this framework requires PDSs and devices to support the last option (above), which is to use this framework. Specifically, the option of providing identities and credentials via the profile data MUST be supported. 
</t><t>
                                Additionally, AoRs are typically known by PDSs that serve the domain indicated by the AoR. Thus, devices can only present the configured AoRs in the respective domains. An exception is the use of federated identities. This allows a device to use a user's AoR in multiple domains. Further even within the same domain, the device's domain proxy and the PDS may be in two different realms, and as such may be associated with different credentials for digest authentication. In such cases, multiple credentials may be configured, and associated with the realms in which they are to be used. This framework specifies only  digest authentication for profile enrollment and the device is not expected to contain any other credentials. For profile retrieval using content indirection, the device will need to support additional credentials such as X.509 certificates (for TLS). Future enhancements can specify additional credential types for profile enrollment and retrieval.

                                        The pseudo-code above (<xref target="ProfileEnrollmentAttempt_pseudo-code"/>) allows for cached profiles to be used. However, any cached local-network profile MUST NOT be used unless the device can ensure that it is in the same local network that provided the cached data. This framework does not provide any procedures for local network recognition. Any cached device and user profiles MUST only be used in domains with which they are associated. For example, a cached device profile is used only when the associated domain matches the current device provider's domain. If a PDS wants to invalidate a profile it may do so by transmitting a NOTIFY with an 'empty profile', i.e.,  profile instance without any included data (if supported by the profile data model; not to be confused with an empty NOTIFY), or via an explicit profile data element that invalidates the data. A device receiving such a NOTIFY MUST discard the applicable profile (i.e., it cannot even store it in the cache). Additionally, if a factory reset is available and performed on a device, it MUST reset the device to its initial state prior to any configuration. Specifically, the device MUST set the device back to the state when it was originally distributed.

                                        The order of profile enrollment is
important. For the profiles specified in this framework, the device MUST enroll
in the following default order: local network, device, and user. The pseudo-code presented earlier (<xref target="ProfileEnrollmentAttempt_pseudo-code"/>) differentiates between 'mandatory' and 'non-mandatory' profiles. This distinction is left to profile data definitions. 
					</t><t>
					It is to be noted that this framework does not allow the devices to inform the PDSs of profile retrieval errors such as invalid data.  Follow-on standardization activities are expected to address this feature.

                                                This framework does not specify the contents for any profile type. Follow-on standardization activities are expected to address profile contents. However, the framework provides the following requirements and recommendations for profile data definitions:
                                </t><t>

                                                <list style="symbols">
                                                        <t>
								The device profile type SHOULD specify parameters to configure the identities and credentials for use in scenarios such as bootstrapping (see <xref target="IdentitiesAndCredentials"/>) and run-time modifications to identities and credentials. This framework recommends the device profile provide the identities and credentials due to a couple of reasons. The local-network profile may not always be available, and even if present, may not be controlled by the device provider who controls device configuration to provide services. Further, the device may not have any users configured prior to being bootstrapped, resulting in an absence of user profile requests. However, this framework does not prevent other profile types from providing identities and credentials to meet deployment needs. For example, the user profile can contain identities and credentials for communicating with specific applications.
                                                        </t>

                                                        <t>
                                                        Each profile MUST clearly identify if it may contain any sensitive data. Such profiles MUST also identify the data elements that are considered sensitive, i.e., data that cannot be disclosed to unauthorized parties. As an example, a device profile definition may identify itself as containing sensitive data and indicate data such as device credentials to be sensitive.
                                                        </t>

                                                        <t>
                                                        When the device receives multiple profiles, the contents of each profile type SHOULD only contain data relevant to the entity it represents. As an example, consider a device that obtains all the defined profiles. Information pertaining to the local network is contained in the 'local-network' profile and not the 'user' profile. This does not preclude relevant data about a different entity from being included in a profile type, e.g., the 'device' profile type may contain information about the users allowed to access services via the device. A profile may also contain starting information to obtain subsequent profiles.

                                                        Data overlap SHOULD be avoided across profile types, unless necessary. If data overlap is present, prioritization of the data is left to data definitions. As an example, the device profile may contain the list of codecs to be used by the device and the user profile (for a user on the device) may contain the codecs preferred by the user. Thus, the same data (usable codecs) is present in two profiles. However, the data definitions may indicate that, to function effectively, any codec chosen for communication needs to be present in both the profiles.

                                The framework specified in this document does not address profile data representation, storage, or retrieval protocols. It assumes that the PDS has a PCC based on existing or other Profile Data Frameworks. 
                                </t><t>

                                While this framework does not impose specific
constraints on any such framework, it does allow for the propagation of profile
content to the PDS (specifically the PCC). Thus, Profile Data Frameworks or retrieval frameworks used in conjunction with this framework MAY consider techniques for propagating incremental, atomic changes to the PDS. One means for propagating changes to a PDS is XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) (<xref target="RFC4825"/>).

However, there may be use cases for additional profile types. e.g., profile types for application specific profile data or to provide enterprise-specific policies. Definition of such additional profile types is not prohibited, but considered out of scope for this document. Such profile definitions MUST specify the order of retrieval with respect to all the other profiles such as the local-network, device, and user profile types defined in this document.

				The profile type is identified in the Event header parameter: "profile-type". A separate SUBSCRIBE dialog is used for each profile type. Thus, the subscription dialog on which a NOTIFY arrives implies which profile's data is contained in, or referred to, by the NOTIFY message body. The Accept header of the SUBSCRIBE request MUST include the MIME types for all profile content types for which the subscribing user agent wishes to retrieve profiles, or receive change notifications.

                                In the following syntax definition using ABNF, EQUAL and token are defined in <xref target="RFC3261"/>. It is to be noted that additional profile types may be defined in subsequent documents.

                                The "device", "user", or "local-network" token in the profile-type parameter may represent a class or set of profile properties. Follow-on standards defining specific profile contents may find it desirable to define additional tokens for the profile-type parameter.  Also, additional content types may be defined along with the profile formats that can be used in the Accept header of the SUBSCRIBE to filter or indicate what data sets of the profile are desired.

                                The "vendor", "model", and "version" parameter values are tokens specified by the implementer of the user agent.  These parameters MUST be provided in the SUBSCRIBE request for all profile types.  The implementer SHOULD use their DNS domain name (e.g., example.com) as the value of the "vendor" parameter so that it is known to be unique, unless there is a good reason not to. Examples of exceptions include: if the vendor does not have an assigned DNS domain name, if they are using a different vendor's implementation, etc.  These parameters are useful to the PDS to affect the profiles provided.  In some scenarios, it is desirable to provide different profiles based upon these parameters.  For example, feature property X in a profile may work differently on two versions of the same user agent.  This gives the PDS the ability to compensate for or take advantage of the differences.  In the following ABNF defining the syntax, EQUAL and quoted-string are defined in <xref target="RFC3261"/>.

                                The "effective-by" parameter in the Event header of the NOTIFY request specifies the maximum number of seconds before the user agent MUST attempt to make the new profile effective.  The "effective-by" parameter MAY be provided in the NOTIFY request for any of the profile types.  A value of 0 (zero) indicates that the subscribing user agent MUST attempt to make the profiles effective immediately (despite possible service interruptions).  This gives the PDS the power to control when the profile is effective.  This may be important to resolve an emergency problem or disable a user agent immediately.  If it is absent, the device SHOULD attempt to make the profile data effective at the earliest possible opportunity that does not disrupt any services being offered. The "effective-by" parameter is ignored in all messages other than the NOTIFY request.  In the following ABNF, EQUAL and DIGIT are defined in <xref target="RFC3261"/>.

For profile data delivered via content indirection, i.e., a pointer to a PCC, then the Content-ID MIME header, as described in <xref target="RFC4483"/>, MUST be used for each profile document URI. At a minimum, the "http:" <xref target="RFC2616"/> and "https:" <xref target="RFC2818"/> URI schemes MUST be supported; other URI schemes MAY be supported based on the Profile Data Frameworks (examples include FTP <xref target="RFC0959"/>, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) <xref target="RFC4510"/>, and XCAP <xref target="RFC4825"/> ).

                        A successful SUBSCRIBE request results in a NOTIFY with either profile contents or a pointer to it (via content indirection). The SUBSCRIBE SHOULD be either authenticated or transmitted over an integrity protected SIP communications channel. Exceptions include cases where the identity of the Subscriber is unknown and the Notifier is configured to accept such requests.

Profile data MAY be sent as profile contents or via content indirection (if the content indirection MIME type was included in the Accept header).

Exceptions include deployments that prohibit such behavior in certain cases (e.g., emergency sessions are in progress). When profile data cannot be applied within the recommended time frame and this affects device behavior, any actions to be taken SHOULD be defined by the profile data definitions.

                This section provides examples along with sample SIP message bodies relevant to this framework. Both the examples are derived from the use case illustrated in <xref target="UseCaseDeviceDifferentSPs"/>, specifically the request for the device profile. The examples are informative only. 
                </t>

                       <section anchor="FrameworkExamples1" title="Example 1: Device Requesting Profile">
                        <t>
                        This example illustrates the detailed message flows between the device and the SIP service provider's network for requesting and retrieving the profile (the flow uses the device profile as an example).
                        </t><t>

                        The following are assumed for this example:
                        </t><t>

                        <list style="symbols">
                                <t>
                                Device is assumed to have established local network connectivity; NAT and firewall considerations are assumed to have been addressed by the SIP service provider.
                                </t>
        
                                <t>
                                Examples are snapshots only and do not illustrate all the interactions between the device and the service provider's network (and none between the entities in the SIP service provider's network).
                                </t>
        
                                <t>
                                All SIP communication with the SIP service provider happens via a SIP proxy.
                                </t>
        
                                <t>
                                HTTP over TLS is assumed to be the Content Retrieval method used (any suitable alternative can be used as well).
                                </t>
                        </list>
                        </t><t>

                        The flow diagram and an explanation of the messages follow.

                        The following example illustrates the case where a user (X) is simultaneously accessing services via two different devices (e.g., multimedia entities on a PC and PDA) and has access to a user interface that allows for changes to the user profile.
                               </t><t>

                                The devices (A &amp; B) obtain the necessary profiles from the same SIP service provider.

                                <t>
                                The SIP service provider also provides a user interface that allows the user to change preferences that impact the user profile.

                        </list>

                        Note: The example only shows retrieval of user X's profile, but it may request and retrieve other profiles (e.g., local-network, device).

        <section anchor="SecurityConsiderations" title="Security Considerations">
                <t>
			The framework specified in this document specifies profile delivery stages, an event package, and three profile types to enable profile delivery. The profile delivery stages are enrollment, content retrieval, and change notification. The event package helps with enrollment and change notifications. Each profile type allows for profile retrieval from a PDS belonging to a specific provider.
			</t><t>
			Enrollment allows a device to request, and if successful, enroll with a PDS to obtain profile data. To transmit the request the device relies on configured, cached, or discovered data. Such data includes provider domain names, identities, and credentials. The device either uses configured outbound proxies or discovers the next-hop entity using <xref target="RFC3263"/> that can result in a SIP proxy or the PDS. It then transmits the request. A SIP proxy receiving the request uses the Request-URI and event header contents to route it to a PDS (via other SIP proxies, if required). 
                        </t><t>
                        When a PDS receives the enrollment request, it can either challenge any contained identity or admit the enrollment. Authorization rules then decide if the enrollment gets accepted. If accepted, the PDS sends an initial notification that contains either the profile data, or content indirection information. The profile data can contain generic profile data (common across multiple devices) or information specific to an entity (such as the device or a user). If specific to an entity, it may contain sensitive information such as credentials. Disclosure of sensitive data can lead to threats such as impersonation attacks (establishing rogue sessions), theft of service (if services are obtainable), and zombie attacks. It is important for the device to ensure the authenticity of the PNC and the PCC since impersonation of the SIP service provider can lead to DoS and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. 
                        </t><t>
			Profile content retrieval allows a device to retrieve profile data via content indirection from a PCC. This communication is accomplished using one of many profile delivery protocols or frameworks, such as HTTP or HTTPS as specified in this document. However, since the profile data returned is subject to the same considerations as that sent via profile notification, similar threats exist. For example, DoS attacks (rogue devices bombard the PCC with requests for a specific profile) and attempts to modify erroneous data onto the PCC (since the location and format may be known). Thus, for the delivery of any sensitive profile data, authentication of the entity requesting profile data is required. It is also important for the requesting entity to authenticate the profile source via content indirection and ensure that the sensitive profile data is protected via data integrity. For sensitive data that should not be disclosed to unauthorized parties, data confidentiality is also required.

                        </t><t>
                        The following subsections highlight the security considerations that are specific to each profile type. 
                </t>

                       <section anchor="SCForLocalNetworkProfile" title="Local-Network Profile">
                        <t>
                                A local network may or may not (e.g., home router) support local-network profiles as specified in this framework. Even if supported, the PDS may only be configured with a generic local-network profile that is provided to every device that requests the local-network profile. Such a PDS may not implement any authentication requirements or TLS.
                                </t><t>

				Alternatively, certain deployments may require the entities -- device and the PDS -- to authenticate each other prior to successful profile enrollment. Such networks may pre-configure user identities to the devices and allow user-specific local-network profiles.  In such networks, the PDS will support digest authentication, and the devices are configured with user identities and credentials as specified in <xref target="IdentitiesAndCredentials"/>. If sensitive profile data is being transmitted, the user identity is a SIPS URI that results in TLS with the next-hop (which is authenticated), and digest authentication is used by the PDS and the device. 
                                </t><t>

				This framework supports both use cases and any variations in between. However, devices obtaining local-network profiles from an unauthenticated PDS are cautioned against potential MITM or PDS impersonation attacks. This framework requires that a device reject sensitive data, such as credentials, from unauthenticated local-network sources. It also prohibits devices from responding to authentication challenges in the absence of TLS on all hops as a result of using a SIPS URI. Responding to unauthenticated challenges allows for dictionary attacks that can reveal weak passwords. The only exception to accepting such sensitive data without authentication of the PDS is in the case of bootstrapping (see <xref target="IdentitiesAndCredentials"/>). In the case of bootstrapping, the methods employed need to be aware of potential security threats such as impersonation.
                                </t><t>

                                SIP Identity is useful for the device to validate notifications in the absence of a secure channel such as TLS when a SIPS URI is used. In such cases, the device can validate the SIP Identity header to verify the source of the profile notification, and the source of the profile data when content indirection is not used. However, the presence of the header does not guarantee the validity of the data. It verifies the source and confirms data integrity, but the data obtained from an undesired source may still be invalid, e.g., invalid outbound proxy information, resulting in DoS. Thus, devices requesting the local-network profile from unknown networks need to be prepared to discard information that prevent retrieval of other, required, profiles.
                               </t>
                </section>

                       <section anchor="SCForDeviceProfile" title="Device Profile">
                        <t>
                                Device profiles deal with device-specific configuration. They may be provided to unknown devices that are attempting to obtaining profiles for purposes such as trials, self-subscription (not to be confused with <xref target="RFC3265"/>), and emergency services <xref target="PHONEBCP"/>.

</t><t>
				This framework allows the device profile to be used for bootstrapping a device. Such bootstrapping profile data may contain enough information to connect to a Provider. For example, it may enable the device to communicate with a device provider, allowing for trial or self-subscription services via visual or audio interfaces (e.g., interactive voice response), or  customer service representatives. The profile data may also allow the device a choice of device providers and allow the end-user to choose one. The profile data may also contain identities and credentials (temporary or long-term) that can be used to obtain further profile data from the network. This framework recommends the use of the SIP Identity header by the PDS. However, to be able to validate the SIP Identity header, the device needs to be pre-configured with the knowledge of allowable domains or certificates for validation (e.g., using PKI). If not, the device can still guarantee header and body integrity if the profile data contains the domain certificate (but the data can still be invalid or malicious). In such cases, devices supporting user interfaces may obtain confirmation from the user trying to bootstrap the device (confirming header and body integrity). However, when the SIP Identity header is not present, or the device is not capable of validating it, the bootstrapping data is unauthenticated and obtained without any integrity protection. Such bootstrapping data, however, may contain only temporary credentials (SIPS URI and digest credentials) that can be used to reconnect to the network to ensure data integrity and data confidentiality prior to obtaining long-term credentials. It is to be noted that such devices are at the mercy of the network they request the device profile from. If they are initialized in a rogue network, or get hijacked by a rogue PDS, the end-user may be left without desired device operation or, worse, unwanted operation. To mitigate such factors the device provider may communicate temporary credentials (e.g., passwords that can be entered via an interface) or permanent credentials (e.g., a USB device) to the end-user for connectivity. If such methods are used, those credentials MUST be quickly replaced by large-entropy credentials, to minimize the impact of dictionary attacks. Future enhancements to this framework may specify device capabilities that allow for authentication without any provider-specific configuration (e.g., X.509 certificates using PKI can allow for authentication by any provider with access to the CA certificate). Alternatively, the device may be pre-configured with credentials for use with content indirection mechanisms. In such circumstances a PDS can use secure content indirection mechanism, such as HTTPS, to provide the bootstrapping data.

				Once a device is associated with a device provider the device profile is vital to device operation. This is because the device profile can contain important operational information such as users that are to be allowed access (white-list or black-list), user credentials (if required) and other sensitive information. Thus, it is necessary to ensure that any device profile containing sensitive information is obtained via an authenticated source, with integrity protection, and delivered to an authenticated device. For sensitive information such as credentials, data confidentiality is also required. The framework requires that devices obtain sensitive information only from authenticated entities except while it is being bootstrapped. In cases where data confidentiality needs to be mandated for notifications, the device provider can configure the device with a SIPS URI, to be used as the Subscription URI, during profile enrollment. The framework also requires a PDS presenting sensitive profile data to use digest authentication. This ensures that the data is delivered to an authenticated entity. Authentication of profile retrieval via content indirection for sensitive profiles is via HTTPS utilizing HTTP digest.

			Devices can only request user profiles for users that are known by a SIP service provider. PDSs are required to reject user profile enrollment requests for any users that are unknown in the network. For known user AoRs that are allowed to retrieve profiles, the security considerations are similar to that of the device profile (except for bootstrapping).
