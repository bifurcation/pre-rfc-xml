    <abstract>
      <t>As the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) evolves, EAP peers
      rely increasingly on information received from the EAP server. EAP
      extensions such as channel binding or network posture information are
      often carried in tunnel methods; peers are likely to rely on this
      information. Cryptographic binding is a facility described in RFC 3748 that protects tunnel methods
      against man-in-the-middle attacks. However, cryptographic binding
      focuses on protecting the server rather than the peer. This memo
      explores attacks possible when the peer is not protected from
      man-in-the-middle attacks and recommends cryptographic binding based on
an Extended Master Session Key, a
      new form of cryptographic binding that protects both peer and
      server along with other mitigations.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) <xref target="RFC3748"></xref>
      provides authentication between a peer (a party accessing some service)
      and a authentication server. Traditionally, peers have not relied
      significantly on information received from EAP servers. However,
      facilities such as EAP channel binding <xref
      target="RFC6677"></xref> provide the peer with confirmation
      of information about the resource it is accessing. Other facilities such
      as EAP Posture Transport <xref target="PT-EAP"></xref>
      permit a peer and EAP server to discuss the security properties of
      accessed networks. Both of these facilities provide peers with
      information they need to rely on and provide attackers who are able to
      impersonate an EAP server to a peer with new opportunities for
      attack.</t>

      <t>Instead of adding these new facilities to all EAP methods, work has
      focused on adding support to tunnel methods <xref
      target="RFC6678"></xref>. There are numerous tunnel
      methods, including <xref target="RFC4851"></xref> and <xref
      target="RFC5281"></xref>, and work on building a Standards Track tunnel
      method <xref target="TEAP"></xref>. These
      tunnel methods are extensible. By adding an extension to support a
      facility such as channel binding to a tunnel method, an extension can be used with
      any inner method carried in the tunnel.</t>

      <t>Tunnel methods need to be careful about man-in-the-middle attacks.
      See <xref
      target="RFC6678"></xref> (Sections 3.2 and 4.6.3) and <xref
      target="TUNNEL-MITM"></xref> for a detailed description of these
      attacks. For example, an attack can happen when a peer is willing to
perform
   authentication inside and outside a tunnel.


An attacker can
      impersonate the EAP server and offer the inner method to the peer.
      However, on the other side, the attacker acts as a man-in-the-middle and
      opens a tunnel to the real EAP server. <xref target="FIG1"/> illustrates this attack.
      At the end of the attack, the EAP server believes it is talking to the
      peer. At the inner method level, this is true. At the outer method
      level, however, the server is talking to the attacker.</t>

        <postamble>A classic tunnel attack where the attacker inserts an extra
        tunnel between the attacker and EAP server.</postamble>
      </figure>

      <t>There are two mitigation strategies for this classic attack.
      First, security policy can be set up so that the same method is not
      offered by a server both inside and outside a tunnel. Second, a technical
      solution is available if the inner method is sufficiently
      strong: cryptographic binding is a security property of a tunnel method under
      which the EAP server confirms that the inner and outer parties are the
      same. Cryptographic binding is typically implemented by requiring  the outer party (the other end
      of the tunnel) to prove knowledge of the Master Session Key (MSK) of the
      inner method. This proves to the server that the inner and outer exchanges are with the same party. RFC 3748's definition of cryptographic binding allows for an optional proof to the peer that the inner and outer exchanges are with the same party. As discussed below, proving knowledge of the MSK is insufficient to prove to the peer that the inner and outer exchanges are with the same party.</t>

    <section title="An Example Problem">
      <t>The GSS-EAP (Generic Security Service Extensible Authentication Protocol) mechanism <xref target="GSS-EAP"></xref>
      provides application authentication using EAP. A peer could reasonably
      trust some applications significantly more than others. If the peer
      sends confidential information to some applications, an attacker may
      gain significant value from convincing the peer that the attacker is the
      trusted application. Channel bindings are used to provide information to  the peer about the application service to which the peer connects. Prior to channel bindings,
      peers could not distinguish one Network Access Service (NAS) from
      another, so attacks where one NAS impersonated another were
      out of scope. However, channel bindings add this capability and thus
      expands the threat model of EAP. The GSS-EAP mechanism requires distinguishing
      one service from another.</t>

      <t>Consider the following example. A relatively untrusted service, say a print server, has been
      compromised. A user is attempting to connect to a trusted service such
      as a financial application. Both the print server and the financial
      application use an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting protocol
      (AAA) to transport EAP authentication back to the user's EAP server. The
      print server mounts a man-in-the-middle attack on the user's connection
      to the financial application and claims to be the application.</t>

      <t>The print server offers a tunnel method towards the peer. The print
      server extracts the inner method from the tunnel and sends it on towards
      the AAA server. Channel binding happens at the tunnel method though. So,
      the print server is happy to confirm that it is the financial
      application. After the inner method completes, the EAP server sends the
      MSK to the print server over the AAA protocol. If only the MSK is needed
      for cryptographic binding, then the print server can successfully perform
      cryptographic binding and may be able to impersonate the
      financial application to the peer.</t>

        <postamble>A modified tunnel attack when an extra server rather than
        extra client is inserted.</postamble>
      </figure>

      <t>This attack is not specific to GSS-EAP. The channel bindings
      specification <xref target="RFC6677"></xref> describes a
      number of situations where channel bindings are important for network
      access. In these situations, one NAS could impersonate another by using a
      similar attack.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="The Server Insertion Attack">
      <t>The previous section described an example of the server insertion
      attack. In this attack, one party adds a layer of tunneling such that
      from the perspective of the EAP peer, there are more methods than from
      the perspective of the EAP server. This attack is most beneficial when
      the party inserting the extra tunnel is a legitimate NAS, so mitigations
      need to be able to prevent a legitimate NAS from inappropriately adding
      a layer of tunneling. Some deployments utilize an intentional
      intermediary that adds an extra level of EAP tunneling between the peer
      and the EAP server; see <xref target="GOODMITM"></xref> for a
      discussion.</t>

      <section title="Conditions for the Attack">
        <t>For an inserted server attack to have value, the attacker needs to
        gain an advantage from its attack.
An attacker could gain an advantage in the following ways:
<list style="symbols">

            <t>The attacker can send information to a peer that the peer would
            trust from the EAP server but not the attacker. Examples of this
            include channel-binding responses.</t>

            <t>The peer sends information to the attacker that was intended
            for the EAP server. For example, the inner user identity may
            disclose privacy-sensitive information. The channel-binding
            request may disclose what service the peer wishes to connect
            to.</t>

            <t>The attacker may influence session parameters. For example, if
            the attacker can influence the MSK, then the attacker may be able
            to read or influence session traffic and mount an attack
            on the confidentiality or integrity of the resulting session.</t>

            <t>An attacker may impact availability of the session. In practice
            though, an attacker that can mount a server insertion attack is
            likely to be able to impact availability in other
            ways.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>For this attack to be possible, the following conditions need to
        hold: <list style="numbers">
            <t>The attacker needs to be able to establish a tunnel method with
            the peer over which the peer will authenticate.</t>

            <t>The attacker needs to be able to respond to any inner
            authentication. For example, an attacker who is a legitimate NAS
            can forward the inner authentication over AAA towards the EAP
            server. Note that the inner authentication may not be
            EAP.</t>

            <t>Typically, the attacker needs to be able to complete the tunnel
            method after inner authentication. This may not be necessary if
            the attacker is gaining advantage from information sent by the
            peer over the tunnel.</t>

            <t>In some cases, the attacker may need to complete a Secure
            Association Protocol (SAP) or otherwise demonstrate knowledge of
            the MSK after the tunnel method successfully
            completes.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Attackers who are legitimate NASes are the primary focus of this
        memo. Previous work has provided mitigation against attackers who are
        not NASes; these mitigations are briefly discussed.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Mitigation Strategies">
        <section title="Server Authentication">
          <t>If the peer confirms the identity of the party that the tunnel
          method is established with, the peer prevents the first condition
          (attacker establishing a tunnel method). Many tunnel methods rely on
          Transport Layer Security (TLS) <xref target="RFC5281"></xref> <xref
          target="TEAP"></xref>. The specifications
          for these methods tend to encourage or mandate certificate checking.
          If the TLS certificate is validated back to a trust anchor and the
          identity of the tunnel method server confirmed, then the first
          attack condition cannot be met.</t>

          <t>Many challenges make server authentication difficult. There is
          not an obvious name by which to identify a tunnel method server. It
          is not obvious where in the tunnel server certificate the name
          should be found. One particularly problematic practice is to use a
          certificate that names the host on which the tunnel server runs.
          Given such a name, it is very difficult for a peer to understand
          whether that server is intended to be a tunnel method server for the
          realm.</t>

          <t>It's not clear what trust anchors to use for tunnel servers.
          Using commercial Certificate Authorities (CAs) is probably
          undesirable because tunnel servers often operate in a closed
          community and are often provisioned with certificates issued by that
          community. Using commercial CAs can be particularly problematic with
          peers that support hostnames in certificates. Then anyone who can
          obtain a certificate for any host in the domain being contacted can
          impersonate a tunnel server.</t>

          <t>These difficulties lead to poor deployment of good certificate
          validation. Many peers make it easy to disable certificate validation.
          Other peers validate back to trust anchors but do not check
          names of certificates. What name types are supported and
          what configuration is easy to perform depend significantly
          on the peer in question.</t>

          <t>Specifications also make the problem worse. For example, <xref
          target="RFC5281"></xref> indicates that the only impact of failing
          to perform certificate validation is that the inner method can be
          attacked. Administrators and implementors believing this claim may
          believe that protection from passive attacks is sufficient.</t>

          <t>In addition, some deployments such as provisioning or strong
          inner methods are designed to work without certificate validation.
          Section 3.9 of the tunnel requirements document <xref
          target="RFC6678"></xref> discusses this
          requirement.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Server Policy">
	  <t>Server policy can potentially prevent the second
          condition (attacker being able to respond to inner
          authentication) from being possible. If the server only
          performs a particular inner authentication within a tunnel,
          then the attacker cannot gain a response to the inner
          authentication without there being such a tunnel. The
          attacker may be able to add a second layer of tunnels; see
          <xref target="FIG.MULTI-TUNNEL"/>. The inner tunnel may
          limit the attacker's capabilities; for example, if channel
          binding is performed over tunnel t2 in the figure, then an
          attacker cannot observe or influence it.</t>

	    <postamble>A tunnel t1 from the peer to the attacker
	    contains a tunnel t2 from the peer to the home EAP
	    server. Inside tunnel t2 is an inner authentication.</postamble>
	  </figure>
	  <t>Peer policy can be combined with this server policy to
	  help prevent conditions 1 (attacker can establish a tunnel
	  the peer will use) and 2 (attacker can respond to inner
	  authentication). If the peer requires exactly one tunnel of
	  a particular type and the EAP server only performs inner
	  authentication over a tunnel of this type, then the attacker
	  cannot establish tunnel t1 in the figure above. Configuring this peer policy may be more challenging than configuring policy on the EAP server.</t>
	  <t>An attacker may be able to mount a more traditional
	  man-in-the-middle attack in this instance; see <xref
	  target="FIG.MITM"/>. This policy on the peer and EAP server
	  combined with a tunnel method that supports cryptographic
	  binding will allow the EAP server to detect the
	  attacker. This means the attacker cannot act as a legitimate
	  NAS and, in particular, does not obtain the MSK. So, if the
	  tunnel between the attacker and peer also requires
	  cryptographic binding and if the cryptographic binding
	  requires both the EAP server and peer to prove knowledge of
	  the inner MSK, then the authentication will fail. If
	  cryptographic binding is not performed, then this attack may
	  succeed.</t>

	    <postamble>A tunnel t1 extends from the peer to the
	    attacker. A tunnel t2 extends from the attacker to the
	    home EAP server. An inner EAP authentication is forwarded
	    unmodified by the attacker from tunnel t1 to tunnel t2. The attacker can
	    observe this inner authentication.</postamble>
	  </figure>

	  <t>Cryptographic binding is only a valuable component of a
	  defense if the inner authentication is a key-deriving EAP
	  method. Most tunnel methods also support non-EAP inner
	  authentication such as Microsoft CHAP version 2 <xref
	  target="RFC2759"/>. This may undermine cryptographic binding
	  in a number of ways. An attacker may be able to convert an
	  EAP method into a compatible non-EAP form of the same
	  credential to suppress cryptographic binding. In addition,
	  an inner authentication may be available through an entirely
	  different means. For example, a Lightweight Directory Access
	  Protocol <xref target="RFC4510"/> or other directory server
	  may provide an attacker a way to get challenges and provide
	  responses for an authentication mechanism entirely outside
	  of the AAA/&wj;EAP context. An attacker with this capability may
	  be able to get around server policy requiring an inner
	  authentication be used only in a given type of tunnel.</t>
	  <t>To recap, the following policy conditions appear
	  sufficient to prevent a server insertion attack:<list
	  style="numbers">
	      <t>Peer and EAP server require a particular inner EAP
	  method used within a particular tunnel method.</t>
	      <t>The inner EAP method's authentication is only
	  available within the tunnel and through no other means
	  including non-EAP means.</t>
	      <t>The inner EAP method produces a key.
</t>
	      <t>The tunnel method uses cryptographic
	      binding and the peer requires the other end of
	      the tunnel to prove knowledge of the inner MSK.</t>

	    </list>
</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Existing Cryptographic Binding">
	  <t>The most advanced examples of cryptographic binding today
	  work at two levels. 
First, the server and peer prove to each other knowledge of
the inner MSK.  Then, the inner MSK is combined with some outer key
material to form the tunnel's EAP keys. 
This is sufficient to detect an inserted server or
	  peer provided that the attacker does not learn the inner
	  MSK. This seems sufficient to defend against attackers who
	  cannot act as a legitimate NAS.</t>
	  <t>The definition of cryptographic binding in <xref target="RFC3748"/> does
	  not require these steps. To meet that definition, it would be
	  sufficient for a peer to prove knowledge of the inner key to
	  the EAP server. This would open some additional attacks. For
	  example, by indicating success, an attacker might be able to
	  mask a cryptographic binding failure.  The peer is
	  unlikely to be able to detect the failure, especially if only the
	  tunnel key material is used for the final keys.</t>
	  <t>As discussed in the previous section, cryptographic
	  binding is only effective when the inner method is EAP.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Introducing EMSK-Based Cryptographic Binding">
	  <t>Cryptographic binding can be strengthened when the inner
          EAP method supports an Extended Master Session Key
          (EMSK). The EMSK is never disclosed to any party other than
          the EAP server or peer, so even a legitimate NAS cannot
          learn the EMSK. So, if the same techniques currently applied
          to the inner MSK are applied to the inner EMSK, then
          condition 3 (completing tunnel authentication) will not hold
          because the attacker cannot complete this new form of
          cryptographic binding. This does not prevent the attacker
          from learning confidential information such as a channel-binding
request sent over the tunnel prior to cryptographic
          binding.</t>
	  <t>Obviously, as with all forms of cryptographic binding,
          cryptographic binding only works for key-deriving inner EAP
          methods. Also, some deployments (see <xref
          target="GOODMITM"/>) insert intermediates between the peer
          and the EAP server. EMSK-based cryptographic binding is
          incompatible with these deployments because the intermediate
          cannot learn the EMSK.</t>
	  <t>Formally, EMSK-based cryptographic binding is a security
          claim for EAP tunnel methods that holds when:<list
          style="numbers">
	      <t>The peer proves to the server that the peer
          participating in any inner method is the same as the peer
          for the tunnel method. </t>
	      <t>The server proves to the peer that the server for any
          inner method is the same as the server for the tunnel
          method.</t>
	      <t>The MSK and EMSK for the tunnel depend on the MSK and
          EMSK of inner methods.</t>
	      <t>The peer MUST be able to force the authentication to
          fail if the peer is unable to confirm the identity of the server.</t>
	      <t>Proofs offered need to be secure even against
          attackers who know the inner method MSK.</t>
	    </list>
</t>
	  <t>If EMSK-based cryptographic binding is not an optional
          facility, it provides a strong defense against server
          insertion attacks and other tunnel man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks for inner
          methods that provide an EMSK. The strength of the defense is
          dependent on the strength of the inner method. EMSK-based
          cryptographic binding MAY be provided as an optional
          facility. The value of
          EMSK-based cryptographic binding is reduced somewhat if it is an
          optional feature. It permits configurations where a peer
          uses other means to authenticate the server if the peer has
          sufficient information configured to validate the
          certificate and identity of an EAP server while using
          EMSK-based cryptographic binding for deployments where that
          is possible.</t>

	  <t>If EMSK-based cryptographic binding is an optional facility,
          the negotiation of whether to use it MUST be protected by
          the inner MSK or EMSK. Typically, the MSK will be used because the
          primary advantage of making EMSK-based cryptographic binding an
          optional facility is to permit intermediates who know only
          the MSK to decline to use EMSK-based cryptographic
          binding.



 The peer MUST have an opportunity to fail the
          authentication after the server declines to use EMSK-based
          cryptographic binding.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Mix Key into Long-Term Credentials">
	  <t>Another defense against tunnel MITM attacks, potentially
	  including server insertion attacks, is to use a different
	  credential for tunneled methods from other
	  authentications. This may prevent the second condition
	  (attacker being able to respond to inner authentication)
	  from taking place. For example, if key material from the
	  tunnel is mixed into a shared secret or password that is the
	  basis of the inner authentication, then the second condition
	  will not hold unless the attacker already knows this shared
	  secret. The advantage of this approach is that it seems to
	  be the only way to strengthen non-EAP inner authentications
	  within a tunnel.</t>
	  <t>There are several disadvantages. Choosing a function to
	  mix the tunnel key material into the inner authentication
	  will be very dependent on the inner authentication. In
	  addition, this appears to involve a layering
	  violation. However, exploring the possibility of providing a
	  solution like this seems important because it can function
	  for inner authentications where no other approach will
	  work.</t>

        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="GOODMITM" title="Intended Intermediates">
	<t>Some deployments introduce a tunnel server separate from
	the EAP server; see <xref target="RFC5281"/> for an example of
	this style of deployment. The tunnel server is between the NAS and the EAP server. The only difference between such an
	intermediate and an attacker is that the intermediate provides
	some function valuable to the peer or EAP server and that the
	intermediate is trusted by the peer. If peers are configured
	with the necessary information to validate certificates of
	these intermediates and to confirm their identity, then tunnel
	MITM and inserted server attacks can be defended against. The
	intermediates need to be trusted with regard to channel
	binding and other services that the peer depends on.</t>
	<t>Support for trusted intermediates is not a requirement
	according to the tunnel method requirements.</t>
	<t>It seems reasonable to treat trusted intermediates as a
	special case if they are supported and to focus on the
	security of the case where there are not intermediates in the
	tunnel as the common case.</t>
</section>
    </section>

    <section title="Recommendations">

      <section title="Mutual Cryptographic Binding">
	<t>The Tunnel EAP method <xref
	target="TEAP"/> should gain support
	for EMSK-based  cryptographic binding.</t>
	<t>As channel-binding support is added to existing EAP
	methods, EMSK-based  cryptographic binding or some other form
	of cryptographic binding that protects against server
	insertion should also be added to
	these methods. Mutual cryptographic binding  may also be
	valuable when other services are added to EAP methods that may
	require a peer trust an EAP server.</t>

      </section>
      <section title="State Tracking">
	<t>Today, mutual authentication in EAP is thought of as a
	security claim about a method. However, in practice, it's an
	attribute of a particular exchange. Mutual authentication can
	be obtained via checking certificates, through mutual
	cryptographic binding, or in very controlled cases through
	carefully crafted peer and server policy combined with
	existing cryptographic binding. Using services like channel
	binding that involve the peer trusting the EAP server should
	require mutual authentication be present in the session.  </t>
	<t>To accomplish this, implementations including channel
	binding or other peer services MUST track whether mutual
	authentication has happened. They SHOULD default to not
	permitting these peer services unless mutual authentication
	has happened. They SHOULD support a configuration where the
	peer fails to authenticate unless mutual authentication takes
	place. Discussion of whether this configuration should be
	recommended as a default is required.</t>

	<t>The Tunnel EAP method <xref target="TEAP"/> should permit peers to force
	authentication failure if they are unable to perform mutual
	authentication. The protocol should permit this to be deferred
	until after mutual cryptographic binding is considered.</t>
	<t>Services such as channel binding should be deferred until
	after cryptographic binding or mutual cryptographic binding.</t>
	<t>An additional complication arises when a tunnel method authenticates multiple parties such as authenticating both the peer machine and the peer user to the EAP server. Depending on how mutual authentication is achieved, only some of these parties may have confidence in it. For example, if a strong shared secret is used to mutually authenticate the user and the EAP server, the machine may not have confidence that the EAP server is the authenticated party if the machine cannot trust the user not to disclose the shared secret to an attacker. In these cases, the parties that have achieved mutual authentication need to be considered when evaluating whether to use peer services.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Certificate Naming">
	<t>Work is required to promote interoperable deployment of
	server certificate validation by peers. A standard way to name
	EAP servers is required. Recommendations for what name forms
	peers should implement is required.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Inner Mixing">


	<t>More consideration of the proposal to mix some key material
	into inner authentications is desired. Currently, the
	proposal is under-defined and fairly invasive. Are there
	versions of this proposal that would be valuable?
   Is there a
   way to view it as something more abstract so that it does not
   involve a combinatorial explosion as a result of considering
   specific tunnels and inner methods?
</t>


      </section>
    </section>


    <section title="Survey of Tunnel Methods">
      <section title="Tunnel EAP (TEAP) Method">
	<t>The Tunnel EAP method <xref target="TEAP"/> provides several features designed to limit man-in-the-middle vulnerabilities and provide a safe platform for peer services.</t>
	<t>TEAP implementations support checking the Network Access
	Identifier (NAI) realm portion against a DNS
	subjectAlternativeName in the certificate of the TEAP
	server. TEAP supports EMSK-based cryptographic binding as a
	way to achieve mutual cryptographic binding. TEAP also
	supports MSK-based cryptographic binding for cases where the
	EMSK is not available; this cryptographic binding does not
	provide  sufficient assurance for peer services. TEAP provides
	recommendations on conditions that need to be met prior to
	using peer services. These recommendations explicitly address
	when the MSK-based cryptographic binding is sufficient and
	when EMSK-based cryptographic binding is required. TEAP meets the  recommendations
	for implementations outlined in this memo.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling
	(FAST)">
	<t>EAP-FAST <xref target="RFC4851"/> provides MSK-based
	cryptographic binding. EAP&nbhy;FAST requires that server
	certificates be validated. However, no guidance is given on
	how servers are named, so the specification does not provide
	enough guidance to interoperably enforce this requirement.</t>
	<t>EAP-FAST does not support channel binding or other peer
	services, although the protocol is extensible and TLVs could
	be defined for peer services. If the certificates are actually
	validated and names checked, then EAP-FAST would provide
	security guarantees sufficient to use these peer
	services. However, the cryptographic binding in EAP-FAST is
	not strong enough to secure peer services if the server
	certificate is not validated and name checked.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="EAP Tunneled Transport Layer Security (EAP-TTLS)">
	<t>The EAP Tunneled Transport Layer Security Version 0 (EAP-TTLS)
	<xref target="RFC5281"/> does not support cryptographic
	binding. It also does not support peer services such as
	channel binding although they could be added using extensible
	AVPs.</t>
	<t>EAP-TTLS recommends that implementations SHOULD validate
	certificates but gives no guidance on how to handle
	naming. Even if certificates are validated, EAP-TTLS is not
	generally suited to peer services. As an example, EAP-TTLS
	does not include protected result indication. So, an
	unprotected EAP success packet can end the authentication. In
	addition, it is difficult for a peer to request services such
	as channel binding because the server ends the authentication
	as soon as authentication is successful.</t>
	<t>A variety of extensions, including EAP-TTLS version 1,
	improve some of these concerns. Specification and
	implementation issues complicate analysis of these
	extensions. As an example, most implementations can be tricked
	into using EAP-TTLS version 0.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This memo examines the security considerations of providing
      new classes of service within EAP methods. Traditionally, the
