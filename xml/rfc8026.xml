    <abstract>
      <t>In IPv6-only provider networks, transporting IPv4 packets
      encapsulated in IPv6 is a common solution to the problem of IPv4 service
      continuity. A number of differing functional approaches have been
      developed for this, each having their own specific characteristics. As
      these approaches share a similar functional architecture and use the
      same data plane mechanisms, this memo specifies a DHCPv6 option, whereby
      a single instance of Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) can interwork with all of the standardized and proposed
      approaches to providing encapsulated IPv4-in-IPv6 services by providing
      a prioritization mechanism.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>IPv4 service continuity is one of the major technical challenges
      that must be considered during IPv6 migration. Over the past few years,
      a number of different approaches have been developed to assist with this
      problem (e.g., as described in <xref target="RFC6333"></xref>, <xref
      target="RFC7596"></xref>, and <xref target="RFC7597"></xref>). These
      approaches, referred to as "S46 mechanisms" in this document, exist in
      order to meet the particular deployment, scaling, addressing, and other
      requirements of different service providers' networks.</t>

      <t>A common feature shared among all of the differing modes is the
      integration of softwire tunnel endpoint functionality into the Customer
      Premises Equipment (CPE) router. Due to this inherent data plane
      similarity, a single CPE may be capable of supporting several different
      approaches. Users may also wish to configure a specific mode of
      operation.</t>

      <t>A service provider's network may also have more than one S46
      mechanism enabled in order to support a diverse CPE population with
      differing client functionality, such as during a migration between
      mechanisms or where services require specific supporting softwire
      architectures.</t>

      <t>For softwire-based services to be successfully established, it is
      essential that the customer's end node and the service provider's end node and
      provisioning systems are able to indicate their capabilities and
      preferred mode of operation.</t>

      <t>A number of DHCPv6 options for the provisioning of softwires have
      been standardized:</t>


      <t><list hangIndent="10" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="RFC 6334">Defines DHCPv6 option 64 for configuring Basic
          Bridging BroadBand (B4) <xref target="RFC6333"></xref> elements
          with the IPv6 address of the Address Family Transition Router (AFTR)
          <xref target="RFC6333"></xref>.</t>

          <t hangText="RFC 7341">Defines DHCPv6 option 88 for configuring the
          address of a DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 server, which can then be used by a
          softwire client for obtaining further configuration.</t>

          <t hangText="RFC 7598">Defines DHCPv6 options 94, 95, and 96 for
          provisioning Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E)
          <xref target="RFC7597"></xref>, Mapping of Address and Port using
          Translation (MAP-T) <xref target="RFC7599"></xref>, and Lightweight
          4over6 <xref target="RFC7596"></xref> respectively.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This document describes a DHCPv6-based prioritization method, whereby
      a CPE that supports several S46 mechanisms and receives configuration
      for more than one can prioritize which mechanism to use. The method
      requires no server-side logic to be implemented and only uses a simple
      S46 mechanism prioritization to be implemented in the CPE.</t>

      <t>The prioritization method as described here does not provide
      redundancy between S46 mechanisms for the client. That is, if the highest
      priority S46 mechanism that has been provisioned to the client is not
      available for any reason, the means for identifying this and falling
      back to the S46 mechanism with the next highest priority is not in the
      scope of this document.</t>


      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>This document makes use of the following terms:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Address Family Transition Router (AFTR): The IPv4-in-IPv6
            tunnel termination point and the Network Address Translator

            operator's network <xref target="RFC6333"></xref>.</t>

            <t>Border Relay (BR): A MAP-enabled router managed by the service
            provider at the edge of a MAP domain. A BR has at least an
            IPv6-enabled interface and an IPv4 interface connected to the

            <t>Customer Premises Equipment (CPE): Denotes the equipment at the
            customer edge that terminates the customer end of an IPv6
            transitional tunnel. In some documents (e.g., <xref
            target="RFC7597"></xref>), this functional entity is called
	    the Customer Edge (CE).</t>

      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
    </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Rationale">
        <t>The following rationale has been adopted for this document:</t>

        <t><list style="format (%d)">
            <t>Simplified solution migration paths: Define unified CPE behavior,
            allowing for smooth migration between the different S46
            mechanisms.</t>

            <t>Deterministic CPE coexistence behavior: Specify the behavior
            when several S46 mechanisms coexist in the CPE.</t>

            <t>Deterministic service provider coexistence behavior: Specify
            the behavior when several modes coexist in the service providers
            network.</t>

            <t>Reusability: Maximize the reuse of existing functional blocks
            including tunnel endpoints, the port-restricted Network Address Port
	    Translator IPv4/IPv4 (NAPT44), forwarding
            behavior, etc.</t>

            <t>Solution agnostic: Adopt neutral terminology and avoid (as far
            as possible) overloading the document with solution-specific
            terms.</t>

            <t>Flexibility: Allow operators to compile CPE software only for
            the mode(s) necessary for their chosen deployment context(s).</t>

            <t>Simplicity: Provide a model that allows operators to only
            implement the specific mode(s) that they require without the
            additional complexity of unneeded modes.</t>

        <t>Upon receipt of a DHCPv6 Advertise message from the server
        containing OPTION_S46_PRIORITY, the client performs the following
        steps:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Check the contents of the DHCPv6 message for options containing
            valid S46 mechanism configuration. A candidate list of possible

            <t>Check the contents of OPTION_S46_PRIORITY for the DHCPv6 option
            codes contained in the included s46-option-code fields. From this,
            an S46 mechanism priority list is created, ordered from highest to
            lowest following the appearance order.</t>

            <t>Sequentially check the priority list against the candidate list
            until a match is found.</t>

            <t>When a match is found, the client MUST configure the resulting
            S46 mechanism.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In the event that no match is found between the priority list and
        the candidate list, the client MAY proceed with configuring one or
        more of the provisioned S46 softwire mechanism(s). In this case, which
        mechanism(s) are chosen by the client is implementation specific and
        not defined here.</t>

        <t>If an invalid OPTION_S46_PRIORITY option is received, the client
        MAY proceed with configuring the provisioned S46 mechanisms as if

        <t>If an unknown option code is received in the OPTION_S46_PRIORITY
        option, the client MUST skip it and continue processing other listed
        option codes if they exist. The initial option codes that are allowed
        to be included in an OPTION_S46_PRIORITY option are listed in <xref
        target="codes"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="DHCPv6 Server Behavior">
        <t>Sections 17.2.2 and 18.2 of <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> govern
        server operation in regard to option assignment. As a convenience to
        the reader, we mention here that the server will send a particular
        option code only if configured with specific values for that option
        code and if the client requested it.</t>

    <section title="Operator Deployment Considerations for Deploying Multiple Softwire Mechanisms">
      <t>The following subsections describe some considerations for operators
      who are planning on implementing multiple softwire mechanisms in their
      network (e.g., during a migration between mechanisms).</t>

      <section title="Client Address Planning">
        <t>As an operator's available IPv4 resources are likely to be limited,
        it may be desirable to use a common range of IPv4 addresses across all
        of the active softwire mechanisms. However, this is likely to result
        in difficulties in routing ingress IPv4 traffic to the correct Border
        Relay (BR) / AFTR instance, which is actively serving a given CE. For
        example, a client that is configured to use MAP-E may send its
        traffic to the MAP-E BR; however, on the return path, the ingress IP
        traffic gets routed to a MAP-T BR. The resulting translated packet
        that gets forwarded to the MAP-E client will be dropped.</t>

        <t>Therefore, operators are advised to use separate IPv4 pools for
        each of the different mechanisms to simplify planning and IPv4
        routing.</t>

        <t>For IPv6 planning, there is less of a constraint as the BR/AFTR
        elements for the different mechanisms can contain configuration for
        overlapping the client's IPv6 addresses, provided that one mechanism is
        actively serving a given client at a time. However, the IPv6 address
        that is used as the tunnel concentrator's endpoint (BR/AFTR address)
        needs to be different for each mechanism to ensure correct
        operation.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Backwards Compatability with Existing Softwire Clients">
        <t>Deployed clients that can support multiple softwire mechanisms,
        but do not implement the prioritization mechanism described here may
        require additional planning. In this scenario, the CPE would request
        configuration for all of the supported softwire mechanisms in its
        DHCPv6 Option Request Option (ORO), but would not request
        OPTION_S46_PRIORITY. By default, the DHCPv6 server will respond with
        configuration for all of the requested mechanisms, which could result
        in unpredictable and unwanted client configuration.</t>

        <t>In this scenario, it may be necessary for the operator to implement
        logic within the DHCPv6 server to identify such clients and only
        provision them with configuration for a single softwire mechanism. It
        should be noted that this can lead to complexity and reduced
        scalability in the DHCPv6 server implementation due to the additional
        DHCPv6 message processing overhead.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Security considerations discussed in <xref target="RFC6334"></xref>
      and <xref target="RFC7598"></xref> apply for this document.</t>

      <t>Misbehaving intermediate nodes may alter the content of the S46
      Priority Option. This may lead to setting a different IPv4 service
      continuity mechanism than the one initially preferred by the network
      side. Also, a misbehaving node may alter the content of the S46 Priority
      Option and other DHCPv6 options (e.g., DHCPv6 Option 64 or 90) so that
      the traffic is intercepted by an illegitimate node. Those attacks are
      not unique to the S46 Priority Option but are applicable to any DHCPv6
      option that can be altered by a misbehaving intermediate node.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA has allocated the following DHCPv6 option
      code:<list>
          <t>111 OPTION_S46_PRIORITY</t>
        </list>All values should be added to the DHCPv6 option code space
      defined in Section 24.3 of <xref target="RFC3315"></xref>.</t>

      <section anchor="codes"
               title="S46 Mechanisms and Their Identifying Option Codes">
        <t>IANA has created a new registry titled
        "Option Codes permitted in the S46 Priority Option". This registry
        enumerates the set of DHCPv6 option codes that can be included in
        the OPTION_S46_PRIORITY option. Options may be added to this list using
        the IETF Review process described in Section 4.1 of <xref
        target="RFC5226"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The following table shows the option codes that are currently
        defined and the S46 mechanisms that they represent. The contents of
        this table shows the format and the initial values for the new
        registry. Option codes that have not been requested to be added
        according to the stated procedure should not be mentioned at all in
        the table, and they should not be listed as "reserved" or "unassigned". The
        valid range of values for the registry is the range of DHCPv6 option
