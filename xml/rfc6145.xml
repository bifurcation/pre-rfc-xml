      This document describes the Stateless IP/ICMP

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction and Motivation">

      <t>
   This document is a product of the 2008-2010 effort to define a
   replacement for NAT-PT <xref target="RFC2766"/> (which was changed to 
   Historic status when <xref target="RFC4966"/> was published in 2007). 

      It is directly derived from
      Erik Nordmark's 
"Stateless IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm (SIIT)"
<xref target="RFC2765"></xref>, which provides
      stateless translation between IPv4 <xref
      target="RFC0791"></xref> and IPv6 <xref target="RFC2460"></xref>, and
      between ICMPv4 <xref target="RFC0792"></xref> and ICMPv6 <xref
      target="RFC4443"></xref>. 
      This document obsoletes RFC 2765 <xref target="RFC2765"></xref>. 
      The changes from RFC 2765 <xref target="RFC2765"></xref>
      are listed in <xref target="changes"/>.

<t>
Readers of this document are expected to have read and understood the
framework described in 
<xref target="RFC6144"></xref>.
Implementations of this IPv4/IPv6 translation specification MUST also
support the address translation algorithms in

Implementations MAY also support
stateful translation

	<t>
       This document specifies the
       translation algorithms between IPv4 packets and IPv6 packets.  	
       </t>

        <t>

	As with 
	<xref target="RFC2765"></xref>,
	the translating function specified in this document does not 
	translate any IPv4 options, and it does not translate IPv6 extension headers 
	except the Fragment Header. 
	</t>

        <t>
       The issues and algorithms in the translation of datagrams
       containing
       TCP segments are described in 
	<xref target="RFC5382"></xref>. 
	 </t>

        <t>

   Fragmented IPv4 UDP packets that do not contain a UDP checksum (i.e.,
   the UDP checksum field is zero) are not of significant use in the
   Internet, and in general will not be translated by the IP/ICMP translator. 
   However, when the translator is configured to forward the packet 
   without a UDP checksum, the fragmented IPv4 UDP packets will be translated. 

	 </t>

<t>
Fragmented ICMP/ICMPv6 packets will not be translated by the IP/ICMP translator.
</t>

        <t>
The IP/ICMP header translation
specified in this document is consistent with requirements of
multicast IP/ICMP headers.  
However, IPv4 multicast
addresses 
<xref target="RFC5771"></xref> 
cannot be mapped to IPv6 multicast addresses
<xref target="RFC3307"></xref> 
based on the unicast mapping rule 
<xref target="RFC6052"></xref>.
       </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="mode" title="Stateless vs. Stateful Mode">
        <t>An IP/ICMP translator has two possible modes of operation:
        stateless and stateful
        <xref target="RFC6144"></xref>.


        In both cases, we assume that a system (a node or an application) that
        has an IPv4 address but not an IPv6 address is communicating with a
        system that has an IPv6 address but no IPv4 address, or that the two
        systems do not have contiguous routing connectivity
        and hence are forced to have their communications translated.</t>

        <t>In the stateless mode, a specific IPv6 address range will represent IPv4 systems (IPv4-converted addresses), 
	 and the IPv6 systems have addresses (IPv4-translatable addresses) that can be algorithmically 
        mapped to a subset of the service provider's IPv4 addresses. 
	 Note that
        IPv4-translatable addresses are a subset of IPv4-converted addresses.

	 In general, there is no need to concern
        oneself with translation tables, as the IPv4 and
        IPv6 counterparts are algorithmically related.
	</t>

        <t>In the stateful mode, a specific IPv6 address range will represent IPv4 systems (IPv4-converted addresses), 
	 but the IPv6 systems may use any IPv6
	addresses <xref target="RFC4291"></xref> except in that range. 
	 In this case, a translation table is required to bind the IPv6 systems' addresses to the IPv4 addresses maintained in the translator.
	</t>

	<t>
	The address translation mechanisms for the stateless and the stateful translations are defined in
       <xref target="RFC6052"></xref>.
	</t>
      </section>

<section anchor="PMTU" title="Path MTU Discovery and Fragmentation">
<t>
Due to the different sizes of the IPv4 and IPv6 header, which are 20+ octets and 40
octets respectively, handling the maximum packet size is critical for the operation 
of the IPv4/IPv6 translator. There are three mechanisms to handle this issue: 
path MTU discovery (PMTUD), fragmentation, and transport-layer negotiation such as 
the TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS) option
<xref target="RFC0879"></xref>.

Note that the translator MUST behave as a router, i.e., 
the translator MUST send a Packet Too Big error message or fragment the packet when the packet size exceeds 
the MTU of the next-hop interface. 
</t>

<t>
Don't Fragment, ICMP Packet Too Big, and packet fragmentation are discussed
in Sections <xref target="v4tov6" format="counter"/> and
<xref target="v6tov4" format="counter"/> of this document.


The reassembling of fragmented packets   in the stateful translator is discussed in
<xref target="RFC6146"/>,
since it requires state maintenance in the translator.

<t>
   When an IP/ICMP translator receives an IPv4 datagram addressed to a
   destination towards the IPv6 domain, it translates the IPv4 header of
   that packet into an IPv6 header.  The original IPv4 header on the
   packet is removed and replaced by an IPv6 header, and the transport
   checksum is updated as needed, if that transport is supported by the
   translator.  The data portion of the packet is left
   unchanged.  The IP/ICMP translator then forwards the packet based on
   the IPv6 destination address.

      <t>
   Path MTU discovery is mandatory in IPv6, but it is optional in IPv4.
IPv6 routers never fragment a packet -- only the sender can do
fragmentation.

     </t>

      <t>When an IPv4 node performs path MTU discovery (by setting the Don't Fragment (DF) bit
      in the header), path MTU discovery can operate end-to-end, i.e., across
      the translator. In this case, either IPv4 or IPv6 routers (including the translator) might send back
      ICMP Packet Too Big messages to the sender. When the IPv6 routers send
      these ICMPv6 errors, they will pass through a translator that will
      translate the ICMPv6 error to a form that the IPv4 sender can understand.
      As a result, an IPv6 Fragment Header is only included if the IPv4 packet
      is already fragmented.</t>



<t>
  However, when the IPv4 sender does not set the DF
  bit, the translator MUST ensure that the packet does not exceed the
  path MTU on the IPv6 side.  This is done by fragmenting the IPv4
  packet (with Fragment Headers) so that it fits in 1280-byte
  IPv6 packets, since that is the minimum IPv6 MTU.  The IPv6
  Fragment Header has been shown to cause operational
  difficulties in practice due to limited firewall fragmentation
  support, etc. In an environment where the network
  owned/operated by the same entity that owns/operates the translator,
  the translator MAY provide a configuration function for the network
  administrator to adjust the threshold of the minimum IPv6 MTU to
  a value that reflects the real value of the minimum IPv6 MTU in
  the network (greater than 1280 bytes). This will help reduce the
  chance of including the Fragment Header in the packets. 
</t>

<t>
  When the IPv4 sender does not set the DF bit,
  the translator SHOULD always include an IPv6 Fragment Header to
  indicate that the sender allows fragmentation. The translator
  MAY provide a configuration function that allows the translator
  not to include the Fragment Header for the non-fragmented
  IPv6 packets. 
</t>

      <t>The rules in <xref target="header46"/> ensure that when packets are fragmented, either by
      the sender or by IPv4 routers, the low-order 16 bits of the fragment
      identification are carried end-to-end, ensuring that packets are correctly
      reassembled. In addition, the rules in <xref target="header46"/> use the presence of an IPv6 Fragment
      Header to indicate that the sender might not be using path MTU discovery 
      (i.e., the packet should not have the DF flag set should it later be
      translated back to IPv4).</t>

      <t>Other than the special rules for handling fragments and path MTU
      discovery, the actual translation of the packet header consists of a
      simple translation as defined below. Note that ICMPv4 packets require special
      handling in order to translate the content of ICMPv4 error messages and
      also to add the ICMPv6 pseudo-header checksum.</t>

<t>
   The translator SHOULD make sure that the packets belonging to the 
   same flow leave the translator in the same order in which they 
   arrived.
</t>

      <section anchor="header46"
               title="Translating IPv4 Headers into IPv6 Headers">

<t>
  If the DF flag is not set and the IPv4 packet will result in an IPv6
  packet larger than 1280 bytes, the packet SHOULD be fragmented so the
  resulting IPv6 packet (with Fragment Header added to each fragment)
  will be less than or equal to 1280 bytes.  For example, if the packet
  is fragmented prior to the translation, the IPv4 packets should be
  fragmented so that their length, excluding the IPv4 header, is at
  most 1232 bytes (1280 minus 40 for the IPv6 header and 8 for the
  Fragment Header). The translator MAY provide a configuration function
  for the network administrator to adjust the threshold of the minimum
  IPv6 MTU to a value greater than 1280-byte if the real value of the
  minimum IPv6 MTU in the network is known to the administrator.
  The resulting fragments are then translated
  independently using the logic described below. 
</t>


<t>
If the DF bit is set and the MTU of the next-hop interface is less than the
total length value of the IPv4 packet plus 20, the translator MUST send an ICMPv4 "Fragmentation Needed" error message
to the IPv4 source address. 
</t>
        <t>If the DF bit is set and the packet is not a fragment
        (i.e., the More Fragments (MF)
        flag is not set and the Fragment Offset is equal to zero), then the translator SHOULD NOT 
        add a Fragment Header to the resulting packet. The IPv6 header fields are set
        as follows: <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Version:">6</t>

            <t hangText="Traffic Class:">By default, copied from the IP Type Of

            some IPv4 environments these fields might be used with the old
            semantics of "Type Of Service and Precedence". 


An implementation of a translator SHOULD support an
administratively configurable option to ignore the IPv4 TOS and always
set the IPv6 traffic class (TC) to zero.

		In addition,
            if the translator is at an administrative boundary, the filtering
            and update considerations of <xref target="RFC2475"></xref> may be
            applicable.

            the IPv6 Hop Limit (after the translation). As part of
            decrementing the TTL or Hop Limit, the translator (as any router)
            MUST check for zero and send the ICMPv4 "TTL Exceeded" or ICMPv6 "Hop Limit

If the received ICMPv4 packet contains an ICMPv4 Extension

the translation of the ICMPv4 packet will cause the ICMPv6 packet to change length.

      <t>There are some differences between IPv6 and IPv4 (in the areas of
      fragmentation and the minimum link MTU) that affect the translation. An
      IPv6 link has to have an MTU of 1280 bytes or greater. The corresponding
      limit for IPv4 is 68 bytes. 


   Path MTU discovery across a translator relies on ICMP 
   Packet Too Big messages being received and processed by IPv6
   hosts, including an ICMP Packet Too Big that indicates the MTU
   is less than the IPv6 minimum MTU.  This requirement is 
   described in Section 5 of 
<xref target="RFC2460"></xref>
(for IPv6's 1280&nbhy;octet 
   minimum MTU) and Section 5 of 
<xref target="RFC1883"></xref>
(for IPv6's previous
   576&nbhy;octet minimum MTU).

</t>

<t>
   In an environment where an ICMPv4 Packet Too Big message is
   translated to an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big message, and the ICMPv6
   Packet Too Big message is successfully delivered to and correctly
   processed by the IPv6 hosts (e.g., a network owned/operated by 
   the same entity that owns/operates the translator), the translator 
   can rely on IPv6 hosts sending subsequent packets to the same
   IPv6 destination with IPv6 Fragment Headers.  In such an 
   environment, when the translator receives an IPv6 packet with a
   Fragment Header, the translator SHOULD generate the IPv4
   packet with a cleared Don't Fragment bit, and with its 
   identification value from the IPv6 Fragment Header, for 
   all of the IPv6 fragments (MF=0 or MF=1).

</t>

<t>
In an environment where an ICMPv4 Packet Too Big message
is filtered (by a network firewall or 
   by the host itself) or not correctly processed by the IPv6 hosts, 
   the IPv6 host will never generate an IPv6 packet with the IPv6 
   Fragment Header.  In such an environment, the translator SHOULD 
   set the IPv4 Don't Fragment bit.  While setting the Don't Fragment 
   bit may create PMTUD black holes 
<xref target="RFC2923"></xref>
if there are IPv4 links
   smaller than 1260 octets, this is considered safer than 
   causing IPv4 reassembly errors 
<xref target="RFC4963"></xref>.
</t>

<t>
 Two recent studies analyzed the behavior of IPv6-capable web

   as expected to an IPv6 Packet Too Big that indicated MTU = 1280, but
   only 43% responded as expected to an IPv6 Packet Too Big that
   indicated an MTU < 1280.  It is believed that firewalls violating Section
   4.3.1 of <xref target="RFC4890"></xref>
    are at fault.  Both failures (the 5% wrong response when MTU = 1280 and the
57% wrong response when MTU < 1280) will cause PMTUD black holes 
   <xref target="RFC2923"></xref>.


   Unfortunately, the 
   translator cannot improve the failure rate of the first case (MTU = 1280), 
   but the translator can improve the failure rate of the second case 
   (MTU < 1280).  There are two approaches to resolving the problem with
   sending ICMPv6 messages indicating an MTU < 1280.  It SHOULD 
   be possible to configure a translator for either of the two

  The first approach is to constrain the deployment of the IPv6/IPv4
   translator by observing that four of the scenarios intended for
   stateless IPv6/IPv4 translators do not have IPv6 hosts on the
   Internet (Scenarios 1, 2, 5, and 6 described in
   <xref target="RFC6144"/>,
	which refer to "An IPv6
   network"). In these scenarios, IPv6 hosts, IPv6-host-based
   firewalls, and IPv6 network firewalls can be administered in
   compliance with Section 4.3.1 of 
   <xref target="RFC4890"></xref>
   and therefore avoid the
   problem witnessed with IPv6 hosts on the Internet.
</t>

<t>
   The second approach is necessary if the translator has IPv6 hosts,
   IPv6-host-based firewalls, or IPv6 network firewalls that do not
   (or cannot) comply with Section 5 of 
   <xref target="RFC2460"></xref>
   -- such as IPv6
   hosts on the Internet. This approach requires the translator to
   do the following:

<list style="numbers">
<t>
    	 In the IPv4-to-IPv6 direction:  if the MTU value of
        ICMPv4 Packet Too Big (PTB) messages is less than 1280, change it
        to 1280.  This is intended to cause the IPv6 host and IPv6
        firewall to process the ICMP PTB message and generate 
        subsequent packets to this destination with an IPv6 
        Fragment Header.

        <vspace blankLines="1" /> 
        Note:  Based on recent studies, this is effective for 
        95% of IPv6 hosts on the Internet.
	 <vspace blankLines="1" /> 
</t>
<t>
In the IPv6-to-IPv4 direction: 
<list style="letters">
<t>
           If there is a Fragment Header in the IPv6 packet,
           the last 16 bits of its value MUST be used for the 
           IPv4 identification value.
</t>
<t>
	    If there is no Fragment Header in the IPv6 packet:
<list style="letters">
<t>
If the packet is less than or equal to 1280 bytes:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
The translator SHOULD set DF to 0 and generate 
                an IPv4 identification value.
</t>
<t>
To avoid the problems described in [RFC4963], it 
                is RECOMMENDED that the translator maintain 3-tuple 
                state for generating the IPv4 identification value.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
If the packet is greater than 1280 bytes, the 
translator SHOULD set the IPv4 DF bit to 1.
</t>
</list>
</t>
</list>
</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The use of stateless IP/ICMP translators does not introduce any new
      security issues beyond the security issues that are already present in
      the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols and in the routing protocols that are used
      to make the packets reach the translator.</t>

	<t>
There are potential issues that might arise by deriving an IPv4 address from 
an IPv6 address -- particularly addresses like broadcast or loopback addresses 
and the non-IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses, etc.  
<xref target="RFC6052"/> 
addresses these issues.
	</t>

<t>
   As with network address translation of IPv4 to IPv4, the IPsec
   Authentication Header 
   <xref target="RFC4302"></xref>
   cannot be used across an IPv6-to-IPv4 translator.
</t>

<t>
   As with network address translation of IPv4 to IPv4, packets with 
   tunnel mode Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) can be translated since tunnel mode ESP does not 
   depend on header fields prior to the ESP header.  Similarly,
   transport mode ESP will fail with IPv6-to-IPv4 translation 
   unless checksum-neutral addresses are used.  In both cases, 
   the IPsec ESP endpoints will normally detect the presence of
   the translator and encapsulate ESP in UDP packets 
   <xref target="RFC3948"></xref>.

<t>
A translator (XLAT) connects the IPv6 network to the IPv4 network. 
This XLAT uses the Network-Specific Prefix (NSP) 2001:db8:100::/40 
defined in
<xref target="RFC6052"/> 
to represent IPv4 addresses 
in the IPv6 address space (IPv4-converted addresses) and to represent 
IPv6 addresses (IPv4-translatable addresses) in the IPv4 address space. 
In this example, 192.0.2.0/24 is the IPv4 block of the corresponding IPv4-translatable 
addresses.
</t>

<t>
Based on the address mapping rule, the IPv6 node H6 has an 
IPv4-translatable IPv6 address 2001:db8:1c0:2:21:: 
(address mapping from 192.0.2.33).  The IPv4 node H4 has 
IPv4 address 198.51.100.2.
</t>

<t>
The IPv6 routing is configured in such a way that the 
IPv6 packets addressed to a destination address in 
2001:db8:100::/40 are routed to the IPv6 interface of the XLAT. 
</t>

<t>
The IPv4 routing is configured in such a way that the 
IPv4 packets addressed to a destination address in 
192.0.2.0/24 are routed to the IPv4 interface of the XLAT.

<section anchor="h6" title="H6 Establishes Communication with H4">
