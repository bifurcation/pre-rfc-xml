<abstract>

<t>The document gives a set of requirements for extending the IETF
Datatracker to give individual IETF community members, including the
IETF leadership, easy methods for tracking the progress of the
Internet-Drafts and RFCs of interest to them.</t>

</abstract>

</front>

<middle>

<section title="Introduction">

<t>The IETF Datatracker is used by many IETF community members to
find the status of Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) and RFCs, and view I-Ds and RFCs that meet
particular criteria. The current Datatracker, found at
&lt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/>, allows anyone to search for
active I-Ds and RFCs, and get a list matching the given criteria.
(The Datatracker also allows for expired I-Ds, but
those are not relevant to this discussion.)</t>

<t>Users can search in the Datatracker by the filename of the I-D,
words in the I-D title, I-D author list, associated Working Group (WG),
IETF area, the responsible Area Director (AD), or IESG status.
They can search for RFCs by number or words in the title. The returned list of
I-Ds and/or RFCs includes six columns: filename or RFC number, the document's
title, the date it was published, its status in the IETF or RFC process, IPR
statements, and the responsible AD (if any).
</t>

<t>Instead of using the search capability of the Datatracker to
manually find I-Ds and RFCs of interest, users might want to create a list of
I-Ds that they normally follow. Some users will want to keep their
list to themselves, but others will want to allow others to view
their list.</t>

<t>Different users in the IETF
community will have different ways that they want to get information
on I-D and RFC updates and status. Many users will want to be notified
immediately, such as through an Atom feed (see <xref
target='RFC4287'/>) or automatically-generated email. Many users will
want to only find out about updates when they go to a Web page. Many
users might want to get the data for a list as input to other tools.
And, of course, some users will want all three. All of these assist users
in tracking I-Ds through their
lifecycle.</t>

<section title="Usage Scenarios">

<t>The main motivation for these proposed changes to the Datatracker
is to allow a variety of potential users to be able to track I-Ds and RFCs,
and thus be better able to see when important events happen. A few
examples include:</t>

<t><list style='symbols'>

<t>A WG chair might want to keep a list of all the
I-Ds from other WGs that relate to active I-Ds in his or her WG.</t>

<t>That same WG chair might want to help WG members be able to follow
the same I-Ds that he or she is following.</t>

<t>Someone who cares about an established topic such as the DNS may
want to follow the various I-Ds that might make changes to the DNS,
as well as be aware if any of the DNS RFCs are later updated and/or have errata posted against them.
This would include not only I-Ds that are in the many WGs that directly are
changing the DNS (DNSEXT, DNSOP, BEHAVE, and so on), but also individual
submissions, IAB I-Ds, IRTF I-Ds, and Independent submissions.
</t>

<t>Developers who are not active in the IETF process might want to
lightly follow I-Ds and RFCs on a particular topic to watch for things that
might affect their implementations.</t>

<t>An IETF "regular" might want to follow parts of the process by
focusing on all the I-Ds that are being shepherded by a particular
Area Director.</t>

</list></t>

</section>

<section title="Context for This Document">

<t>This document describes the requirements for extending the
Datatracker for such capabilities. When complete, this document may
be used to issue an RFP for the design and development of these
enhancements to the Datatracker.</t>

<t>Some of the requirements in this document are listed as
"later requirements". It is expected that items listed in this
document would be part of the initial RFP because they provide
the highest benefit to the community; the later requirements might
be part of a later RFP.</t>

<t>The initial general requirements that led to the specific
requirements this document described tools that include:</t>

<t><list style='symbols'>

<t>the ability to create one or more (possibly large) lists of I-Ds
that community members want to follow</t>

<t>the ability to get notifications when particular I-Ds from a
list change state</t>

<t>the ability to see all of the state changes that have occurred on
all the I-Ds in a list over a specified range of dates</t>

<t>the ability to set the granularity of the changes (such as "every
change", "just approvals and publication", and so on)</t>

<t>the ability to organize views of a list in many fashions
that would be useful to different types of community members</t>

<t>the ability to share and merge lists with other community
members</t>

</list></t>

<t>Note that <xref target='RFC2026'/> describes the process that
I-Ds go through before they either become RFCs or are abandoned.
The Datatracker does not control this process: instead, it
simply reports on the current state of each I-D as it goes
through the process.</t>

</section>

<section title="Definitions Used in This Document">

<t>A "user" is an individual person who is a member of the IETF
community.</t>

<t>A "list" is an unordered set of RFCs, I-Ds, and groups of
I-Ds. Lists are specified by users. In some cases, the
authors are role-based, such as a WG chair being the
specifier of the list associated with that WG.</t>

<t>An "attribute" is a feature of an I-D or RFC, such as its filename or RFC number,
its current state in the IETF or RFC process, and so on. Attributes are
usually displayed as columns in the Datatracker.</t>

<t>A "row" is a set of attributes about a single I-D or RFC that is displayed
in the Datatracker.</t>

<t>A "significant change in status" is all approvals and disposition of
an I-D. Assuming that the changes to the Datatracker specified in
<xref target="RFC6174"/>, <xref target="RFC6175"/> and <xref target="ALTSTREAMS"/> are made, "all approvals"
means the following:</t>

<t><list style='symbols'>

<t>IETF stream: the WG states "Adopted by a WG", "In WG Last Call",
"WG Consensus: Waiting for Write-up", "Parked WG document", and "Dead
WG document"; the IESG states "Publication Requested", "In Last
Call", "IESG Evaluation", and "Sent to the RFC Editor"</t>

<t>IAB stream: "Active IAB Document", "Community Review", and "Sent
to the RFC Editor"</t>

<t>IRTF stream: "Active RG Document", "In RG Last Call", "Awaiting
IRSG Reviews", "In IESG Review", "Sent to the RFC Editor", and
"Document on Hold Based On IESG Request"</t>

<t>ISE stream: "Submission Received", "In ISE Review", "In IESG
Review", "Sent to the RFC Editor", and "Document on Hold Based On
IESG Request"</t>

<t>All streams: in addition to the above,
the disposition states "Approved",
"RFC Published", and "Dead" are also included</t>

</list></t>

<t>An "update to an RFC" is the announcement of a newer RFC that
updates or obsoletes the base RFC, an in-place change to
the RFC's maturity level, the RFC's status being changed
to historic, or an announcement of an errata
posted for the base RFC.</t>

</section>

<section title="Expected User Interactions">

<t>When a user wants to follow a group of I-Ds and/or RFCs, he or she goes to
the Datatracker and creates a new list. The requirements for lists
are given in Section 2.1. After a list is created, the user has three
ways that he or she might see when I-Ds and/or RFCs in the list are updated:</t>

<t><list style='symbols'>

<t>By going to the Datatracker page for the list (see Section 2.3)</t>

<t>By subscribing to the Atom feed for the list (see Section 2.2.2)
in a feed reader that automatically fetches updates</t>

<t>By subscribing to the mail stream for the list (see Section 2.2.3)
and reading the mail stream in their mail reader</t>

</list></t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Requirements for Tools Features">

<t>This section defines the requirements for the tool described
earlier in this document. The eventual tool, if implemented, may have
more features than are listed here; however, before this document is
finished, it should contain as many requirements as possible upon
which the IETF community can agree.</t>

<section title="Lists">

<section title="Requirement: Lists of I-Ds and RFCs can be large">

<t>An active IETF participant might want to follow the status of
hundreds of I-Ds and dozens of RFCs; for example, some ADs have 100 I-Ds in their
area.  Additionally, they may also want to follow I-Ds outside their area
that affect documents in their area.</t>

</section>

<section title="Requirement: Every Datatracker user can create one list">

<t>When a user gets a Datatracker account, that account comes with
an empty list pre-defined. 

<!-- [rfced] We are having trouble parsing this sentence.  To what does an "empty 
list pre-defined" refer?

   When a user gets a Datatracker account, that account comes with
   an empty list pre-defined.

-->

The list can normally be modified only by the
owner of the account, although the Secretariat can also modify the
list as part of its support role for the Datatracker. Each Datatracker
user is restricted to having one list.</t>

<t>In order for this requirement to be met, it must be easy for any
community member to get a Datatracker account. Account setup must
not involve any direct action on the part of the Secretariat.
However, the Secretariat will be responsible for support of
Datatracker accounts (lost passwords, odd interactions, and so
on), so this addition of more Datatracker accounts will potentially
increase the amount of work the Secretariat must do.</t>

<t>The only person who can edit the contents of a private list is the
person who knows the password to the account with which the list is
associated.</t>

</section>

<section title="Requirement: Read-only views of private lists can be
made visible to others">

<t>Some users will want to make available a read-only view of their
list. Each private list will have a URL that leads to the Datatracker
view of the list; that URL must be able to be shared
without giving others the ability to edit the list.  Similarly,
the Atom feed associated with a private list must be able to be
shared without giving others the ability to edit the list.</t>

</section>

<section title="Requirement: The Datatracker must support optional
publicly-readable lists for WGs and Area Directors">

<t>It is common in the IETF for users to follow the work of an entire
WG, not just single I-Ds and RFCs within a WG. It is also very common
that some work that is related to a WG happens outside the WG, either
in other WGs or as individual efforts. Many WG chairs monitor this
outside-the-WG activity for various reasons.</t>

<t>A smaller number of community members follow an entire Area's
worth of topics. Again, these topics often happen within the WGs
of an area, but not always; for example, some topics related to
the Security Area happen in WGs in the Applications Area.</t>

<t>Because of this, it would be useful for community members to be
able to find a list that corresponds to the WGs or Areas in which
they are interested.  The WG lists could be maintained by the WG
chairs; the Area lists would likely be maintained by the ADs. Note
that such lists are not mandatory; for example, a WG chair might not
choose to maintain such a list for a WG whose topic is extremely
broad.</t>

<t>Both Working Group chairs and Area Directors currently already
have Datatracker accounts, so fulfilling this requirement only
involves associating those accounts with the role that controls the
list.</t>

</section>

<section title="Requirement: Specifying the I-Ds and RFCs that are in a list must be simple">

<t>When a user creates a new list, it must be easy to add single
I-Ds and RFCs to the list. This could be done using the Datatracker's current
search facility, and simply adding an "add to list" option to
the display of searched-for I-Ds.
Further, when editing an existing list, it must be easy to
add additional I-Ds and RFCs, and it must be easy to remove I-Ds and RFCs from a
list.</t>

</section>

<section title="Requirement: Adding groups of I-Ds to a list by attribute must be simple">

<t>I-Ds have many attributes, and some users might want to follow
all of the I-Ds that have a particular attribute. Some, but not
all, attributes have values that make sense in specifying lists. It
should be easy to add each of the following attributes when adding to
or editing a list:</t>

<t><list style='symbols'>

<t>All I-Ds associated with an particular WG</t>
<t>All I-Ds associated with all WGs in an particular Area</t>
<t>All I-Ds with a particular responsible AD</t>
<t>All I-Ds with a particular author</t>
<t>All I-Ds with a particular document shepherd</t>
<t>All I-Ds that have a reference to a particular RFC</t>
<t>All I-Ds that have a reference to a particular I-D</t>
<t>All I-Ds that are referenced by a particular RFC</t>
<t>All I-Ds that are referenced by a particular I-D</t>
<t>All I-Ds that contain a particular text string</t>

</list></t>

<t>These attributes are dynamic, and thus the list of
I-Ds that have a particular attribute will change after the user
adds that attribute to a list. The Datatracker should update
lists with dynamic attributes as often as is sensible for the
server environment, such as once an hour or more.</t>

<t>Note that some of these attributes are based on
heuristics derived by programs that parse I-Ds, and are therefore inherently
not completely reliable.</t>

</section>

<section title="Requirement: Private information must not be exposed in lists">

<t>Any private information in the Datatracker must be excluded from
any displays of the lists or mail streams. This
private information includes private notes in the IESG balloting
for an I-D, and probably other data that currently is restricted
to being seen by certain members of the IETF leadership.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Notifications">

<section title="Requirement: Users can be notified when an I-D changes status">

<t>Some users do not want to go to the Datatracker's display page to
find out when an I-D or RFC has been updated. Instead, they want to be
notified immediately after the change. The Datatracker
needs to support this type of immediate notification, where
"immediate" means within an hour of a change to any I-D or RFC in the
list. This requirement can be met with Atom feeds and mail streams,
as described in the next two sections.</t>

<t>The Datatracker might create a generic "notifications engine" that
can be used to generate the Atom feeds and mail streams. This engine
can then be used to later add other notification types, such as
a Jabber feed.</t>

</section>

<section title="Requirement: Every list has Atom feeds associated with it">

<t>The list will have two Atom feeds 
that are generated from the changes to the list: one for every change
in status and another for significant change of status. Each Atom
feed will have a stable URL that can be used by feed readers.</t>

<t>Many IETF users are already using Atom feeds created by the IETF
Tools Team for single I-Ds. Using the new feeds for lists
described here will allow them to have better selection capabilities
to reduce the number of feeds they need to follow.</t>

</section>

<section title="Requirement: Every list has mail streams associated with it">

<t>A user can subscribe to two mail streams that are generated from
the changes to the list: one for every change in status, and another
for significant change of status.</t>

<t>Note that the mail streams are for each change; they are not batched (such as
one message per day). Users who want less frequent but batched notifications
need to use the Atom feeds instead of the mail streams.</t>

</section>

<section title="Requirement: Notifications need to specify which list caused the notification">

<t>Users might have feeds and/or subscriptions to multiple lists. In order to
disambiguate duplicate notifications from multiple lists, the body of
the message in the Atom feed or mail stream needs to say which
list generated the notification. (Ideally, a user who wants
notifications will make one list based on multiple lists, but if they
subscribe to multiple lists, this requirement will at least suggest
to them that they want to limit their overlapping subscriptions.)</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Display in the Datatracker">

<section title="Requirement: Users can define their Datatracker document view">

<t>There are many ways that a user might want to see the
Datatracker's HTML view of a list. For example, a user might want the view
displayed in alphabetical order by the I-Ds' filenames and RFC numbers, but
after the user is off the net for a week, he or she might want the view
displayed in order of changes of status so that those I-Ds and RFCs changed
recently appear at the top.</t>

<t>The default is to
list I-Ds in alphabetical order by I-D filename, with RFCs at the end.
When displaying a list, the Datatracker should allow easy sorting of the
I-Ds with the following collation orders:</t>

<t><list style='symbols'>

<t>Alphabetical by I-D filename and RFC number</t>
<t>Alphabetical by document title</t>
<t>Alphabetical by associated WG</t>
<t>Date of publication of current version of the document</t>
<t>Date of most recent change of status of any type</t>
<t>Date of most recent significant change of status</t>

</list></t>

<t>In displays, a particular I-D or RFC should only be
included once; for example, if someone manually adds
draft-ietf-cuteacronym-sometopic to his list and also specifies that
all I-Ds from the "cuteacronym" WG are included in the list, that
I-D should only appear once in the display. The column saying which
included list(s) contain this I-D helps alleviate this loss of
information.</t>

<t>The user might also want to group the I-Ds using the groupings
in the list, such as "all I-Ds from this WG" and "all I-Ds
that contain this word in the title".</t>

<t>The Datatracker should save the last-chosen sorting for display
with the definition of the list.</t>

</section>

<section title="Requirement: Users can choose which attributes to display">

<t>There are many attributes that might be displayed, and different users will
have different information that they want to see. Also, users will have
different display technologies: someone might normally use a Web browser
on a large screen, but at other times use the browser on their
phone.</t>

<t>Choosing which attributes should be displayed should be simple for
the user. The Datatracker should save the
last-chosen set of attributes for display with the definition of the
list. The default is to display the I-D filename or RFC number, document title, date
of current I-D or RFC publication date, status in the RFC queue or RFC process,
the associated stream (IETF WG, IRTF RG, IAB, or ISE),
whether it was changed within the last 7 days, and included list(s)
that contain this I-D.

<!-- [rfced] In the following, to what does "RFC stream" refer?  Should 
"stream" be "queue"?

   The default is to display the I-D filename or RFC number, document title,
   date of current I-D or RFC publication date, status in the RFC stream or
   RFC process, the associated stream (IETF WG, IRTF RG, IAB, or ISE), 
   whether it was changed within the last 7 days, and included list(s) which
   contain this I-D. 
-->
</t>

<t>The Datatracker should support display of the following attributes:</t>

<t><list style='symbols'>

<t>I-D filename</t>
<t>I-D title</t>
<t>Date of current I-D</t>
<t>Status in the IETF process</t>
<t>Associated WG or RG</t>
<t>Associated AD, if any</t>
<t>Changed within the last 1 day</t>
<t>Changed within the last 2 days</t>
<t>Changed within the last 7 days</t>

</list></t>

<t>There is some leeway for how the Datatracker might display these attributes.
For example, the "changed within" attributes might be shown with a check mark
or a colored box.</t>

</section>

<section title="Requirement: Users can flag I-Ds with dates in the future">

<t>When tracking I-Ds, some users want to be able to say "tell me
if this I-D has not changed state by a particular date" such as
when an I-D is starting a two-week last call or an I-D author has
promised a new version by the end of the week. This feature gives
the user a "dashboard" style capability.</t>

<t>For each I-D, the user should be able to set a marker date by which an
update is expected.  The Datatracker display will provide a visual
indication if the marker date has passed but no change in status has
occurred.  It must be very easy for the user to remove these
update-expected markers.</t>

</section>

<section title="Requirement: Users can specify highlighting of I-Ds and RFCs with recent changes">

<t>The Datatracker cannot easily keep track of when a user last
looked at the page for a particular list. Thus, it instead needs to
let a user say which range of dates they are most interested in. To
that end, the user needs to be able to easily specify the amount of
time they consider recent, either as "the past nnn hours", "the past
nnn days", or "since this particular date".</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="File Output">

<section title="Requirement: Users can get their current list as a single file">

<t>Some users have their own tools for displaying and otherwise
processing lists of I-Ds and RFCs. To make this easier, users should be able
to get a machine-parsable file that has a well-known format and
syntax that contains all the data that was used to create the current
display. The order of the records in the file is not important
because it is assumed that the user's program will sort the results
themselves. All attributes will be included because it is assumed
that the user's programs will only deal with the ones the user cares
about.</t>

<t>When a list is marshaled into a data file, each record in the file
format represents a single I-D or RFC. In a file, a particular I-D or RFC is
only included once; for example, if someone manually adds
draft-ietf-cuteacronym-sometopic to his list and also specifies that
all I-Ds from the "cuteacronym" WG are included in the list, that
I-D only appears once.</t>

<t>This feature will allow anyone to create mash-ups of their own
and create their own Web sites based on the IETF data. This is significantly
easier than adding features to the Datatracker, and is able to cater
to narrow audiences. The format of this file has yet to be determined.</t>

</section>

</section>

</section>

<section title='Security Considerations'>

<t>A tool for tracking the status of I-Ds and RFCs can
affect the privacy of its users. Someone could possibly determine
relevant information about a user if they knew what that user was
tracking.</t>

<t>Web applications, particularly those that store data on a Web
server, are a common source of security issues such as cross-site
scripting attacks. The tool described in this document might also
use access control for lists, and access control and authentication
also cause security issues if not implemented properly.</t>

<section title="Possible Tracking of Other Data">

<t>It is not at all clear if any of
these will be a requirement, a later requirement, or a
non-requirement.
Further, even if one or more of these non-I-D items is made
a requirement, it is not clear whether they will be included in the
same lists with I-Ds. That is, if tracking IANA registry changes are considered
a requirement, it is not clear whether a user would include the
registries in a list that also contains I-Ds, or whether they would need
to create two lists, one for I-Ds and one for IANA registries.</t>

<section title="Tracking WG Charter Changes">

<t>It will soon be easier to track changes in WG charters and milestones;
see <xref target="RFC6292"/> for more information. Someone
subscribing to the mail stream for a WG would be able to see each of these
changes. With the expected changes, the Datatracker would be able to
update WGs in a list without any polling.</t>

</section>

<section title="Tracking IANA Registry Changes">

<t>Developers may need to get values from IANA registries for their
software/hardware implementations. They might want to know when the registry
changes, such as additional entries or updates to current entries. Thus, being
able to be notified when a registry changes would be valuable to them.</t>

<t>Adding this functionality may be tricky for some registries. For example,
if a developer cared about DKIM signature tags, they would have to
subscribe to &lt;http://www.iana.org/assignments/dkim-parameters/>
which (currently) covers a handful of registries, all related to DKIM.
Thus, a change to the DKIM hash algorithms would trigger a message showing
that the registry had changed, even though the DKIM signature tags registry
had not.</t>

</section>

<section title="Tracking Changes in the Liason Statement Directory">

<t>Users might want to know when a new liaison statement is sent by
the IETF or when one is received by the IETF.</t>

</section>

<section title="Tracking Changes in Documents Outside the IETF Sphere">

<t>Users might want to track
documents that relate to IETF activities but are produced by other
standards development organizations (SDOs) such as the W3C, the IEEE, the
Unicode Consortium, the ITU, and others. In order for the tracker to track
these documents, it would need to poll occasionally and possibly
scrape listings from HTML.</t>

</section>

<section title="Tracking Additions to the IPR Statement Repository">

<t>Users might want to know when a new IPR statement is submitted.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Ideas that Might Be Implemented Later">

<t>The following are ideas for the new tool that are not currently
being considered for the first round of development, but are
being documented for possible future use. Items from this list may move to the
list of requirements that are expected to be integrated during the first round
of development.
</t>

<t><list style="symbols">

<t>The Datatracker could list all of the publicly-readable lists (or
certainly at least the ones associated with IETF activities), and
have links from WG pages in the Datatracker to the publicly-readable
lists maintained by the WG chairs.</t>

<t>Draft versions of this RFC included a requirement
to be able to include other lists. While this may still be desired,
it was decided that implementing this in a safe and understandable
way would be too difficult. In particular, there was a concern
about detecting and handling loops. Later versions of the Datatracker might
include this feature.</t>

<t>In public lists, it might be useful for someone to be able to
understand why particular I-Ds and/or groups are added. Allowing
the user who put together the list to add a comment field would help
someone else understand the motivation.</t>

<t>The Datatracker might remove lists if it seems that storing
them on the Datatracker is taking too many resources. 

<!-- [rfced] In the following sentence, it sounds as though the Datatracker 
could automatically remove lists without warning.  Is this the intent?

   The Datatracker might remove lists if it seems that storing
   them on the Datatracker is taking too many resources.
-->

The Datatracker can periodically send mail to the user
reminding them to delete lists that are no longer needed.</t>

<t>The normal Datatracker display could have a button to add a
particular I-D to the user's personal list.</t>

<t>Allow each user to determine what "significant change in status"
is for the list they create. This could be done by a series of check
boxes for every possible status change.</t>

<t>A list creator can add a list-level comment about
who might be interested in following the list.</t>

<t>If the agendas for an upcoming meeting are scraped for I-D names,
it would be possible to add an attribute to an I-D that lists that
WG agenda(s) on which it appears.</t>

<t>In the section on "Adding groups of I-Ds to a list by
attribute", add an attribute for "all I-Ds that are referenced by
any I-D in a particular list".</t>

<t>Make it possible to add all I-Ds that have a certain section to
a list (non-trivial IANA considerations, ASN.1 modules in
appendices, MIBs, ABNF, XML modules, ...).</t>

<t>Even though Atom feeds have been around for years, they are new to many
Internet users, and even experienced users only know how to use them
in limited ways. The Datatracker should have at least a few paragraphs
explaining how the Atom feeds that it provides can be used in different
tools such as dedicated feed readers, online feed-display services, and
so on.</t>
