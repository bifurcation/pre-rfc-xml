<abstract><t>
This document describes the "date" and "index" extensions to the Sieve email
filtering language.  The "date" extension gives Sieve
the ability to test date and time values in various ways.
The "index" extension provides a means to limit header and address
tests to specific instances of header fields when header fields
are repeated.
</t></abstract>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>
Sieve <xref target='RFC5228' /> is a language for filtering email
messages at or around the time of final delivery.  It is designed to be
implementable on either a mail client or mail server.  It is meant to be
extensible, simple, and independent of access protocol, mail architecture,
and operating system.  It is suitable for running on a mail server where users
may not be allowed to execute arbitrary programs, such as on black box
Internet Message Access Protocol <xref target="RFC3501" /> servers, as
it does not have
user-controlled loops or the ability to run external programs.
</t>

<t>
The "date" extension provides a new date test to extract and match 
date/time information from structured header fields.
The date test is similar in concept to the
address test specified in <xref target='RFC5228' />,
which performs similar operations on addresses in header fields.
</t>

<t>
The "date" extension also provides a currentdate test that operates on the
date and time when the Sieve script is executed.
</t>

<t>
Some header fields containing date/time information, e.g., Received:, naturally
occur more than once in a single header. In such cases it is useful to be able
to restrict the date test to some subset of the fields that are present. For
example, it may be useful to apply a date test to the last (earliest)
Received: field. Additionally, it may also be useful to apply similar restrictions
to either the header or address tests specified in <xref target="RFC5228" />. 
</t>

<t>
For this reason, this specification also defines an "index" extension. This
extension adds two additional tagged arguments :index and :last to the header,
address, and date tests. If present, these arguments specify which occurrence
of the named header field is to be tested. 
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="conventions" title="Conventions Used in This Document">

<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.
</t>

<t>
The terms used to describe the various components of the Sieve
language are taken from Section 1.1 of <xref target='RFC5228' />.
Section 2 of the same document describes basic Sieve language syntax
and semantics.  The date-time syntactic element defined using ABNF
notation <xref target="RFC5234" /> in <xref target='RFC3339' /> is
also used here.
</t>

</section>

<section title='Capability Identifiers'>

<t>
The capability strings associated with the two extensions defined in this
document are "date" and "index".
</t>

</section>

<section title='Date Test'>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Usage:   date [<":zone" <time-zone: string>> / ":originalzone"]
              [COMPARATOR] [MATCH-TYPE] <header-name: string>
              <date-part: string> <key-list: string-list>
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
The date test matches date/time information derived from headers
containing <xref target="RFC2822" /> date-time
values. The date/time information is extracted from the header, shifted to
the specified time zone, and the value of the given date-part is determined.
The test returns true if the resulting string matches any of the
strings specified in the key-list, as controlled by the comparator and match
keywords. The date test returns false unconditionally if the specified header
field does not exist, the field exists but does not contain a syntactically
valid date-time specification, the date-time isn't valid according to the
rules of the calendar system (e.g., January 32nd, February 29 in a non-leap
year), or the resulting string fails to match any key-list value.
</t>

<t>
The type of match
defaults to ":is" and the default comparator is "i;ascii-casemap".
</t>


<t>
Unlike the header and address tests, the date test can only be applied
to a single header field at a time. If multiple header fields with the
same name are present, only the first field that is found is used. (Note,
however, that this behavior can be modified with the "index" extension
defined below.) These restrictions simplify the test and keep the meaning
clear. 
</t>

<t>
The "relational" extension <xref target='RFC5231' /> adds a match
type called ":count".  The count of a date test is 1 if the specified field
exists and contains a valid date; 0, otherwise.
</t>

<t>
Implementations MUST support extraction of RFC 2822 date-time information that
either makes up the entire header field (e.g., as it does in a standard
Date: header field) or appears at the end of
a header field following a semicolon (e.g., as it does in a standard Received:
header field). Implementations MAY support extraction of date and time
information in RFC2822 or other formats that
appears in other positions in header field content. In the case of a field
containing more than one date or time value, the last one that appears SHOULD
be used.
</t>

<section title="Zone and Originalzone Arguments">

<t>
The :originalzone argument specifies that the time zone offset originally in the
extracted date-time value should be retained. The :zone argument specifies
a specific time zone offset that the date-time value is to be shifted to prior to
testing. It is an error to specify both :zone and :originalzone.
</t>

<t>
The value of time-zone MUST be an offset relative to
UTC with the following syntax:
</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
    time-zone  =  ( "+" / "-" ) 4DIGIT
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
The "+" or "-" indicates whether the
time-of-day is ahead of (i.e., east of) or behind (i.e., west of)
UTC.  The first two digits indicate the number of hours
difference from Universal Time, and the last two digits indicate the
number of minutes difference from Universal Time. Note that this agrees with
the RFC 2822 format for time zone offsets, not the ISO 8601 format.
</t>

<t>
If both the :zone and :originalzone arguments are omitted, the local time zone
MUST be used.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Date-part Argument">

<t>
The date-part argument specifies a particular part of the resulting date/time
value to match against the key-list. Possible case-insensitive values are:
</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  "year"      => the year, "0000" .. "9999".
  "month"     => the month, "01" .. "12".
  "day"       => the day, "01" .. "31".
  "date"      => the date in "yyyy-mm-dd" format.
  "julian"    => the Modified Julian Day, that is, the date
                 expressed as an integer number of days since
                 00:00 UTC on November 17, 1858 (using the Gregorian
                 calendar).  This corresponds to the regular
                 Julian Day minus 2400000.5.  Sample routines to
                 convert to and from modified Julian dates are
                 given in Appendix A.
  "hour"      => the hour, "00" .. "23".
  "minute"    => the minute, "00" .. "59".
  "second"    => the second, "00" .. "60".
  "time"      => the time in "hh:mm:ss" format.
  "iso8601"   => the date and time in restricted ISO 8601 format.
  "std11"     => the date and time in a format appropriate
                 for use in a Date: header field [RFC2822].
  "zone"      => the time zone in use.  If the user specified a
                 time zone with ":zone", "zone" will
                 contain that value.  If :originalzone is specified
                 this value will be the original zone specified
                 in the date-time value.  If neither argument is
                 specified the value will be the server's default
                 time zone in offset format "+hhmm" or "-hhmm".  An
                 offset of 0 (Zulu) always has a positive sign.
  "weekday"   => the day of the week expressed as an integer between
                 "0" and "6". "0" is Sunday, "1" is Monday, etc.
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
The restricted ISO 8601 format is specified by the date-time ABNF
production given in <xref target="RFC3339" />, Section 5.6, with
the added restrictions that the letters "T" and "Z" MUST be in
upper case, and a time zone offset of zero MUST be represented by
"Z" and not "+00:00".
</t>

</section>

<section title="Comparator Interactions with Date-part Arguments">

<t>
Not all comparators are suitable with all date-part arguments. In 
general, the date-parts can be compared and tested for equality with 
either "i;ascii-casemap" (the default) or "i;octet", but there are 
two exceptions:
</t>

<t>
<list style="hanging" hangIndent="8">

<t hangText="julian">
This is an integer, and may or may not 
have leading zeros. As such, "i;ascii-numeric" is almost
certainly the best comparator to use with it.
</t>

<t hangText="std11">
This is provided as a means to obtain date/time values in a format appropriate
for inclusion in email header fields. The wide range of possible syntaxes for
a std11 date/time -- which implementations of this extension are free to use
when composing a std11 string -- makes this format a poor choice for comparisons.
Nevertheless, if a comparison must be performed, this is case-insensitive, and
therefore "i;ascii-casemap"  needs to be used.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
"year", "month", "day", "hour", "minute", "second" and 
"weekday" all use fixed-width string representations of integers, and 
can therefore be compared with "i;octet", "i;ascii-casemap", and 
"i;ascii-numeric" with equivalent results.
</t>

<t>
"date" and "time" also use fixed-width string representations of integers, and
can therefore be compared with "i;octet" and "i;ascii-casemap";
however, "i;ascii-numeric" can't be used with it, as "i;ascii-numeric"
doesn't allow for non-digit characters.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="dateexamples" title="Examples">

<t>
The Date: field can be checked to test when the sender claims to
have created the message and act accordingly:
</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  require ["date", "relational", "fileinto"];
  if allof(header :is "from" "boss@example.com",
           date :value "ge" :originalzone "date" "hour" "09",
           date :value "lt" :originalzone "date" "hour" "17")
  { fileinto "urgent"; }
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
Testing the initial Received: field can provide an indication of when a message
was actually received by the local system:
</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  require ["date", "relational", "fileinto"];
  if anyof(date :is "received" "weekday" "0",
           date :is "received" "weekday" "6")
  { fileinto "weekend"; }
]]></artwork></figure>

</section>

</section>

<section anchor="currentdate" title="Currentdate Test">

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Usage:   currentdate [":zone" <time-zone: string>]
                     [COMPARATOR] [MATCH-TYPE]
                     <date-part: string>
                     <key-list: string-list>
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
The currentdate test is similar to the date test, except that it
operates on the current date/time rather than a value extracted from
the message header. In particular, the ":zone" and date-part
arguments are the same as those in the date test.
</t>

<t>
All currentdate tests in a single Sieve script 
MUST refer to the same point in time during execution of the script.
</t>

<t>
The :count value of a currentdate test is always 1.
</t>

<section anchor="currentdateexamples" title="Examples">

<t>
The simplest use of currentdate is to have an action that only
operates at certain times. For example, a user might want to
have messages redirected to their pager after business hours and on
weekends:
</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  require ["date", "relational"];
  if anyof(currentdate :is "weekday" "0",
           currentdate :is "weekday" "6",
           currentdate :value "lt" "hour" "09",
           currentdate :value "ge" "hour" "17")
  { redirect "pager@example.com"; }
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
Currentdate can be used to set up vacation 
<xref target='RFC5230' /> responses in advance and to
stop response generation automatically:
</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  require ["date", "relational", "vacation"];
  if allof(currentdate :value "ge" "date" "2007-06-30",
           currentdate :value "le" "date" "2007-07-07")
  { vacation :days 7  "I'm away during the first week in July."; }
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
Currentdate may also be used in conjunction with the variables
extension to pass time-dependent arguments to other tests and
actions. The following Sieve places messages in a folder named
according to the current month and year:
</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  require ["date", "variables", "fileinto"];
  if currentdate :matches "month" "*" { set "month" "${1}"; }
  if currentdate :matches "year"  "*" { set "year"  "${1}"; }
  fileinto "${month}-${year}";
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
Finally, currentdate can be used in conjunction with the editheader
extension to insert a header-field containing date/time information:
</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   require ["variables", "date", "editheader"];
   if currentdate :matches "std11" "*"
     {addheader "Processing-date" "${0}";}
]]></artwork></figure>

</section>

</section>

<section anchor="index" title="Index Extension">

<t>
The "index" extension, if specified, adds optional :index and :last
arguments to the header, address, and date tests as follows:
</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Syntax:   date [":index" <fieldno: number> [":last"]]
               [<":zone" <time-zone: string>> / ":originalzone"]
               [COMPARATOR] [MATCH-TYPE] <header-name: string>
               <date-part: string> <key-list: string-list>
]]></artwork></figure>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Syntax:   header [":index" <fieldno: number> [":last"]]
                 [COMPARATOR] [MATCH-TYPE]
                 <header-names: string-list> <key-list: string-list>
]]></artwork></figure>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Syntax:   address [":index" <fieldno: number> [":last"]]
                  [ADDRESS-PART] [COMPARATOR] [MATCH-TYPE]
                  <header-list: string-list> <key-list: string-list>
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
If :index &lt;fieldno&gt; is specified, the attempts to match 
a value are limited to the header field fieldno (beginning
at 1, the first named header field).  If :last is also specified,
the count is backwards; 1 denotes the last named header field,
2 the second to last, and so on. Specifying :last without :index
is an error.
</t>

<t>
:index only counts separate header fields, not multiple occurrences within
a single field. In particular, :index cannot be used to test a specific
address in an address list contained within a single header field.
</t>

<t>
Both header and address allow the specification of more than one
header field name. If more than one header field name is specified,
all the named header fields are counted in the order specified by the
header-list.
</t>

<section anchor="indexexample" title="Example">

<t>
Mail delivery may involve multiple hops, resulting in the Received: field
containing information about when a message first entered the local
administrative domain being the second or subsequent field in the message.
As long as the field offset is consistent, it can be tested:
</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  # Implement the Internet-Draft cutoff date check assuming the
  # second Received: field specifies when the message first
  # entered the local email infrastructure.
  require ["date", "relational", "index"];
  if date :value "gt" :index 2 :zone "-0500" "received"
          "iso8601" "2007-02-26T09:00:00-05:00",
  { redirect "aftercutoff@example.org"; }
]]></artwork></figure>

<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

<t>
The facilities defined here, like the facilities in the base
Sieve specification, operate on message header information that
can easily be forged. Note, however, that some fields are
inherently more reliable than others. For example, the Date: field
is typically inserted by the message sender and can be altered at
any point. By contrast, the uppermost Received: field is typically
inserted by the local mail system and is therefore difficult for the
sender or an intermediary to falsify.
</t>

<t>
Use of the currentdate test makes script behavior inherently less
predictable and harder to analyze. This may have consequences for systems
that use script analysis to try and spot problematic scripts.
</t>

<t>
All of the security considerations given in the base Sieve
specification also apply to these extensions.
