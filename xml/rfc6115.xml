    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	It is commonly recognized that the Internet routing and addressing
	architecture is facing challenges in scalability, multihoming, and
	inter-domain traffic engineering.  The problem being addressed has
	been documented in
	<xref target='Scalability_PS'/>, and the design
	goals that we have discussed can be found in
	<xref target='RRG_Design_Goals'/>. 
      </t>
      <t>
	This document surveys many of the proposals that were brought
	forward for discussion in this activity.  For some of the
	proposals, this document also includes additional analysis showing
	some of the concerns with specific proposals, and how some of those
	concerns may be addressed.  Readers are cautioned not to draw any
	conclusions about the degree of interest or endorsement by the
	Routing Research Group (RRG) from the presence of any proposals in
	this document, or the amount of analysis devoted to specific
	proposals.
      </t>
      <section title="Background to This Document">
	<t>
	  The RRG was chartered to research and recommend a new routing
	  architecture for the Internet.  The goal was to explore many
	  alternatives and build consensus around a single proposal.  The
	  only constraint on the group's process was that the process be
	  open and the group set forth with the usual discussion of
	  proposals and trying to build consensus around them.  There were
	  no explicit contingencies in the group's process for the
	  eventuality that the group did not reach consensus.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The group met at every IETF meeting from March 2007 to March 2010
	  and discussed many proposals, both in person and via its mailing
	  list. Unfortunately, the group did not reach consensus.  Rather
	  than lose the contributions and progress that had been made, the
	  chairs (Lixia Zhang and Tony Li) elected to collect the proposals of
	  the group and some of the debate concerning the proposals and
	  make a recommendation from those proposals.  Thus, the
	  recommendation reflects the opinions of the chairs and not
	  necessarily the consensus of the group.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The group was able to reach consensus on a number of items that
	  are included below.  The proposals included here were collected
	  in an open call amongst the group.  Once the proposals were
	  collected, the group was solicited to submit critiques of each
	  proposal.  The group was asked to self-organize to produce a
	  single critique for each proposal.  In cases where there were
	  several critiques submitted, the editor selected one.  The
	  proponents of each proposal then were given the opportunity to
	  write a rebuttal of the critique.  Finally, the group again had
	  the opportunity to write a counterpoint of the rebuttal.  No
	  counterpoints were submitted.  For pragmatic reasons, each
	  submission was severely constrained in length.
	</t>
	<t>
	  All of the proposals were given the opportunity to progress their
	  documents to RFC status; however, not all of them have chosen to
	  pursue this path.  As a result, some of the references in this
	  document may become inaccessible.  This is unfortunately
	  unavoidable.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The group did reach consensus that the overall document should be
	  published.  The document has been reviewed by many of the active
	  members of the Research Group.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Areas of Group Consensus" anchor='Consensus'>
	<t>
	  The group was also able to reach broad and clear consensus on
	  some terminology and several important technical points.  For the
	  sake of posterity, these are recorded here:
	  <list style='numbers'>
	    <t>
	      A "node" is either a host or a router.  
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      A "router" is any device that forwards packets at the network
	      layer (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) of the Internet architecture.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      A "host" is a device that can send/receive packets 
	      to/from the network, but does not forward packets.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      A "bridge" is a device that forwards packets at the link
	      layer (e.g., Ethernet) of the Internet architecture.  An
	      Ethernet switch or Ethernet hub are examples of bridges.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      An "address" is an object that combines aspects of identity
	      with topological location.  IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are
	      current examples. 
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      A "locator" is a structured topology-dependent name that 
	      is not used for node identification and is not a path.  
	      Two related meanings are current, depending on the class 
	      of things being named:
	      <list style='numbers'>
		<t>
		  The topology-dependent name of a node's interface.
		</t>
		<t>
		  The topology-dependent name of a single subnetwork OR
		  topology-dependent name of a group of related subnetworks
		  that share a single aggregate.  An IP routing prefix is a
		  current example of the latter.
		</t>
	      </list>
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      An "identifier" is a topology-independent name for a logical
	      node. Depending upon instantiation, a "logical node" might be
	      a single physical device, a cluster of devices acting as a
	      single node, or a single virtual partition of a single
	      physical device.  An OSI End System Identifier (ESID) is an
	      example of an identifier.  A Fully Qualified Domain Name
	      (FQDN) that
	      precisely names one logical node is another example. (Note
	      well that not all FQDNs meet this definition.)
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Various other names (i.e., other than addresses, locators, or
	      identifiers), each of which has the sole purpose of
	      identifying a component of a logical system or physical
	      device, might exist at various protocol layers in the
	      Internet architecture.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The Research Group has rough consensus that separating identity
	      from location is desirable and technically feasible.  However,
	      the Research Group does NOT have consensus on the best
	      engineering approach to such an identity/location split.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The Research Group has consensus that the Internet needs to
	      support multihoming in a manner that scales well and does not
	      have prohibitive costs.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Any IETF solution to Internet scaling has to not only support
	      multihoming, but address the real-world constraints of the 
	      end customers (large and small).

      <section title='Critique'>
	<t>
	  LISP+ALT distributes mapping information to ITRs via (optional,
	  local, potentially caching) Map Resolvers and with globally
	  distributed query servers: ETRs and optional Map Servers (MSes).
	</t>

	<t>
	  A fundamental problem with any global query server network is
	  that the frequently long paths and greater risk of packet loss
	  may cause ITRs to drop or significantly delay the initial packets
	  of many new sessions.  ITRs drop the packet(s) they have no
	  mapping for.  After the mapping arrives, the ITR waits for a
	  re-sent packet and will tunnel that packet correctly.  These
	  "initial-packet delays" reduce performance and so create a major
	  barrier to voluntary adoption on a wide enough basis to solve the
	  routing scaling problem.
	</t>

	<t>
	  ALT's delays are compounded by its structure being "aggressively
	  aggregated", without regard to the geographic location of the
	  routers.  Tunnels between ALT routers will often span
	  intercontinental distances and traverse many Internet routers.
	</t>

	<t>
	  The many levels to which a query typically ascends in the ALT
	  hierarchy before descending towards its destination will often
	  involve excessively long geographic paths and so worsen
	  initial-packet delays.
	</t>

	<t>
	  No solution has been proposed for these problems or for the
	  contradiction between the need for high aggregation while making
	  the ALT structure robust against single points of failure.
	</t>

	<t>
	  LISP's ITRs' multihoming service restoration depends on their
	  determining the reachability of end-user networks via two or more
	  ETRs.  Large numbers of ITRs doing this is inefficient and may
	  overburden ETRs.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Testing reachability of the ETRs is complex and costly -- and
	  insufficient.  ITRs cannot test network reachability via each
	  ETR, since the ITRs do not have the address of a device in
	  each ETR's network.
	  So, ETRs must report network unreachability to ITRs.
	</t>

	<t>
	  LISP involves complex communication between ITRs and ETRs, with
	  UDP and 64-bit LISP headers in all traffic packets.
	</t>

	<t>
	  The advantage of LISP+ALT is that its ability to handle billions
	  of EIDs is not constrained by the need to transmit or store the
	  mapping to any one location.  Such numbers, beyond a few tens of
	  millions of EIDs, will only result if the system is used for
	  mobility.  Yet the concerns just mentioned about ALT's structure
	  arise from the millions of ETRs that would be needed just for
	  non-mobile networks.
	</t>

	<t>
	  In LISP's mobility approach, each Mobile Node (MN) needs an RLOC
	  address to be its own ETR, meaning the MN cannot be behind a
	  NAT. Mapping changes must be sent instantly to all relevant ITRs
	  every time the MN gets a new address -- LISP cannot achieve this.
	</t>

	<t>
	  In order to enforce ISP filtering of incoming packets by source
	  address, LISP ITRs would have to implement the same filtering on
	  each decapsulated packet. This may be prohibitively expensive.
	</t>

	<t>
	  LISP monolithically integrates multihoming failure detection and
	  restoration decision-making processes into the Core-Edge
	  Separation (CES) scheme itself.  End-user networks must rely on the
	  necessarily limited capabilities that are built into every ITR.
	</t>

	<t>
	  LISP+ALT may be able to solve the routing scaling problem, but
	  alternative approaches would be superior because they eliminate
	  the initial-packet delay problem and give end-user networks
	  real-time control over ITR tunneling.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Rebuttal'>
	<t>
	  Initial-packet loss/delays turn out not to be a deep
	  issue. Mechanisms for interoperation with the legacy part of the
	  network are needed in any viably deployable design, and LISP has
	  such mechanisms. If needed, initial packets can be sent via those
	  legacy mechanisms until the ITR has a mapping. (Field experience
	  has shown that the caches on those interoperation devices are
	  guaranteed to be populated, as 'crackers' doing address-space
	  sweeps periodically send packets to every available mapping.)
	</t>
	<t>
	  On ALT issues, it is not at all mandatory that ALT be the mapping
	  system used in the long term. LISP has a standardized mapping
	  system interface, in part to allow reasonably smooth deployment
	  of whatever new mapping system(s) experience might show are
	  required. At least one other mapping system (LISP-TREE)
	  <xref target='LISP-TREE'/>, which avoids ALT's problems (such as
	  query load concentration at high-level nodes), has already been
	  laid out and extensively simulated. Exactly what mixture of
	  mapping system(s) is optimal is not really answerable without
	  more extensive experience, but LISP is designed to allow
	  evolutionary changes to other mapping system(s).
	</t>
	<t>
	  As far as ETR reachability goes, a potential problem to which
	  there is a solution with an adequate level of efficiency,
	  complexity, and robustness is not really a problem. LISP has a
	  number of overlapping mechanisms that it is believed will
	  provide adequate reachability detection (along the three axes
	  above), and in field testing to date, they have behaved as
	  expected.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Operation of LISP devices behind a NAT has already been
	  demonstrated. A number of mechanisms to update correspondent
	  nodes when a mapping is updated have been designed (some are
	  already in use).

    <section title="Routing Architecture for the Next Generation Internet
		    (RANGI)"> 
      <section title='Summary'>
	<section title="Key Idea">
	  <t>
	    Similar to Host Identity Protocol (HIP)
	    <xref target='RFC4423'/>, RANGI introduces a host identifier
	    layer between the network layer and the transport layer, and
	    the transport-layer associations (i.e., TCP connections) are no
	    longer bound to IP addresses, but to host identifiers. The
	    major difference from HIP is that the host identifier in RANGI
	    is a 128-bit hierarchical and cryptographic identifier that has
	    organizational structure. As a result, the corresponding
	    ID->locator mapping system for such identifiers has a
	    reasonable business model and clear trust boundaries. In
	    addition, RANGI uses IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses as
	    locators. The Locator Domain Identifier (LD ID) (i.e., the
	    leftmost 96 bits) of this locator is a provider-assigned /96
	    IPv6 prefix, while the last four octets of this locator are a
	    local IPv4 address (either public or private). This special
	    locator could be used to realize 6over4 automatic tunneling
	    (borrowing ideas from the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel
	    Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) <xref target='RFC5214'/>), which
	    will reduce the deployment cost of this new routing
	    architecture. Within RANGI, the mappings from FQDN to host
	    identifiers are stored in the DNS system, while the mappings
	    from host identifiers to locators are stored in a distributed
	    ID/locator mapping system (e.g., a hierarchical Distributed
	    Hash Table (DHT) system, or a reverse DNS system).
	  </t>
	</section>

	<section title='Gains'>
	  <t>
	    RANGI achieves almost all of the goals set forth by RRG as
	    follows:
	    <list style='numbers'>
	      <t>
		Routing Scalability: Scalability is achieved by decoupling
		identifiers from locators.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Traffic Engineering: Hosts located in a multihomed site
		can suggest the upstream ISP for outbound and inbound
		traffic, while the first-hop Locator Domain Border Router
		(LDBR; i.e., site border router) has the final decision
		on the upstream ISP selection.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Mobility and Multihoming: Sessions will not be interrupted
		due to locator change in cases of mobility or multihoming.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Simplified Renumbering: When changing providers, the local
		IPv4 addresses of the site do not need to change. Hence, the
		internal routers within the site don't need renumbering.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Decoupling Location and Identifier: Obvious.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Routing Stability: Since the locators are topologically
		aggregatable and the internal topology within the LD will
		not be disclosed outside, routing stability could be
		improved greatly.

	      <t>
		Routing Security: RANGI reuses the current routing system
		and does not introduce any new security risks into the
		routing system.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Incremental Deployability: RANGI allows an easy transition
		from IPv4 networks to IPv6 networks. In addition, RANGI

      <section title='Critique'>
	<t>
	  RANGI is an ID/locator split protocol that, like HIP, places a
	  cryptographically signed ID between the network layer (IPv6) and
	  transport. Unlike the HIP ID, the RANGI ID has a hierarchical
	  structure that allows it to support ID->locator lookups. This
	  hierarchical structure addresses two weaknesses of the flat HIP
	  ID: the difficulty of doing the ID->locator lookup, and the
	  administrative scalability of doing firewall filtering on flat
	  IDs. The usage of this hierarchy is overloaded: it serves to make
	  the ID unique, to drive the lookup process, and possibly other
	  things like firewall filtering.  More thought is needed as to
	  what constitutes these levels with respect to these various
	  roles.
	</t>

	<t>
	  The RANGI document <xref target="RANGI"/> suggests FQDN->ID
	  lookup through DNS, and separately an ID->locator lookup that may
	  be DNS or may be something else (a hierarchy of DHTs).  It would
	  be more efficient if the FQDN lookup produces both ID and
	  locators (as does the Identifier-Locator Network Protocol
	  (ILNP)).  Probably DNS alone is sufficient for the ID->locator
	  lookup since individual DNS servers can hold very large numbers
	  of mappings.
	</t>

	<t>
	  RANGI provides strong sender identification, but at the cost of
	  computing crypto.  Many hosts (public web servers) may prefer to
	  forgo the crypto at the expense of losing some functionality
	  (receiver mobility or dynamic multihoming load balancing).  While
	  RANGI doesn't require that the receiver validate the sender, it
	  may be good to have a mechanism whereby the receiver can signal
	  to the sender that it is not validating, so that the sender can
	  avoid locator changes.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Architecturally, there are many advantages to putting the mapping
	  function at the end host (versus at the edge).  This simplifies
	  the problems of neighbor aliveness and delayed first packet, and
	  avoids stateful middleboxes.  Unfortunately, the early-adopter
	  incentive for host upgrade may not be adequate (HIP's lack of
	  uptake being an example).
	</t>

	<t>
	  RANGI does not have an explicit solution for the mobility race
	  condition (there is no mention of a home-agent-like device).
	  However, host-to-host notification combined with fallback on the
	  ID->locators lookup (assuming adequate dynamic update of the
	  lookup system) may be good enough for the vast majority of
	  mobility situations.
	</t>

	<t>
	  RANGI uses proxies to deal with both legacy IPv6 and IPv4 sites.
	  RANGI proxies have no mechanisms to deal with the edge-to-edge
	  aliveness problem. The edge-to-edge proxy approach dirties up an
	  otherwise clean end-to-end model.
	</t>

	<t>
	  RANGI exploits existing IPv6 transition technologies (ISATAP and
	  softwire).  These transition technologies are in any event being
	  pursued outside of RRG and do not need to be specified in RANGI
	  drafts per se.  RANGI only needs to address how it interoperates
	  with IPv4 and legacy IPv6, which it appears to do
	  adequately well through proxies.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Rebuttal'>
	<t>
	  The reason why the ID->locator lookup is separated from the
	  FQDN->ID lookup is: 1) not all applications are tied to FQDNs,
	  and 2) it seems unnecessary to require all devices to possess a
	  FQDN of their own. Basically, RANGI uses DNS to realize the
	  ID->locator mapping system. If there are too many entries to be
	  maintained by the authoritative servers of a given Administrative
	  Domain (AD), Distributed Hash Table (DHT) technology can be used
	  to make these authoritative servers scale better, e.g., the
	  mappings maintained by a given AD will be distributed among a
	  group of authoritative servers in a DHT fashion. As a result, the
	  robustness feature of DHT is inherited naturally into the
	  ID->locator mapping system. Meanwhile, there is no trust issue
	  since each AD authority runs its own DHT ring, which maintains
	  only the mappings for those identifiers that are administrated by
	  that AD authority.
	</t>
	<t>
	  For host mobility, if communicating entities are RANGI nodes, the
	  mobile node will notify the correspondent node of its new locator
	  once its locator changes due to a mobility or re-homing
	  event. Meanwhile, it should also update its locator information
	  in the ID->locator mapping system in a timely fashion by using
	  the Secure DNS Dynamic Update mechanism defined in
	  <xref target='RFC3007'/>. In case of simultaneous mobility, at
	  least one of the nodes has to resort to the ID->locator mapping
	  system for resolving the correspondent node's new locator so as
	  to continue their communication. If the correspondent node is a
	  legacy host, Transit Proxies, which fulfill a similar function as
	  the home agents in Mobile IP, will relay the packets between the
	  communicating parties.
	</t>
	<t>
	  RANGI uses proxies (e.g., Site Proxy and Transit Proxy) to deal
	  with both legacy IPv6 and IPv4 sites. Since proxies function as
	  RANGI hosts, they can handle Locator Update Notification messages
	  sent from remote RANGI hosts (or even from remote RANGI proxies)
	  correctly. Hence, there is no edge-to-edge aliveness
	  problem. Details will be specified in a later version of
	  RANGI-PROXY.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The intention behind RANGI using IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses as
	  locators is to reduce the total deployment cost of this new
	  Internet architecture and to avoid renumbering the site's internal
	  routers when such a site changes ISPs.

    <section title="Internet Vastly Improved Plumbing (Ivip)">
      <section title='Summary'>
	<section title='Key Ideas'>
	  <t>
	    Ivip (pronounced eye-vip, est. 2007-06-15) is a Core-Edge
	    Separation scheme for IPv4 and IPv6.  It provides multihoming,
	    portability of address space, and inbound traffic engineering
	    for end-user networks of all sizes and types, including those
	    of corporations, SOHO (Small Office, Home Office), and mobile devices.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Ivip meets all the constraints imposed by the need for widespread
	    voluntary adoption <xref target='Ivip_Constraints' />.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Ivip's global fast-push mapping distribution network is
	    structured like a cross-linked multicast tree.  This pushes all
	    mapping changes to full-database query servers (QSDs) within
	    ISPs and end-user networks that have ITRs.  Each mapping
	    change is sent to all QSDs within a few seconds. (Note: "QSD"
	    is from Query Server with full Database.)
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    ITRs gain mapping information from these local QSDs within a
	    few tens of milliseconds.  QSDs notify ITRs of changed mappings
	    with similarly low latency.  ITRs tunnel all traffic packets to
	    the correct ETR without significant delay.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Ivip's mapping consists of a single ETR address for each range
	    of mapped address space.  Ivip ITRs do not need to test
	    reachability to ETRs because the mapping is changed in
	    real-time to that of the desired ETR.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    End-user networks control the mapping, typically by contracting
	    a specialized company to monitor the reachability of their ETRs,
	    and change the mapping to achieve multihoming and/or traffic
	    engineering (TE).  So, the mechanisms that control ITR
	    tunneling are controlled by the end-user networks in real-time
	    and are completely separate from the Core-Edge Separation
	    scheme itself.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    ITRs can be implemented in dedicated servers or hardware-based
	    routers.  The ITR function can also be integrated into sending
	    hosts.  ETRs are relatively simple and only communicate with
	    ITRs rarely -- for Path MTU management with longer packets.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Ivip-mapped ranges of end-user address space need not be subnets.
	    They can be of any length, in units of IPv4 addresses or IPv6 /64s.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Compared to conventional unscalable BGP techniques, and to the
	    use of Core-Edge Separation architectures with non-real-time
	    mapping systems, end-user networks will be able to achieve more
	    flexible and responsive inbound TE.  If inbound traffic is
	    split into several streams, each to addresses in different
	    mapped ranges, then real-time mapping changes can be used to
	    steer the streams between multiple ETRs at multiple ISPs.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Default ITRs in the DFZ (DITRs; similar to LISP's Proxy Tunnel
	    Routers) tunnel packets sent by hosts in networks that lack
	    ITRs.  So multihoming, portability, and TE benefits apply to all
	    traffic.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    ITRs request mappings either directly from a local QSD or via
	    one or more layers of caching query servers (QSCs), which in
	    turn request it from a local QSD.  QSCs are optional but
	    generally desirable since they reduce the query load on
	    QSDs.  (Note: "QSC" is from Query Server with Cache.)
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    ETRs may be in ISP or end-user networks.  IP-in-IP
	    encapsulation is used, so there is no UDP or any other header.
	    PMTUD (Path MTU Discovery) management with minimal complexity
	    and overhead will handle the problems caused by encapsulation,
	    and adapt smoothly to jumbo frame paths becoming available in
	    the DFZ.  The outer header's source address is that of the
	    sending host -- this enables existing ISP Border Router (BR)
	    filtering of source addresses to be extended to encapsulated
	    traffic packets by the simple mechanism of the ETR dropping
	    packets whose inner and outer source address do not match.
	  </t>
	</section>

	<section title='Extensions'>
	  <section title='TTR Mobility'>
	    <t>
	      The Translating Tunnel Router (TTR) approach to mobility
	      <xref target='Ivip_Mobility' /> is applicable to all
	      Core-Edge Separation techniques and provides scalable IPv4
	      and IPv6 mobility in which the MN keeps its own mapped IP
	      address(es) no matter how or where it is physically
	      connected, including behind one or more layers of NAT.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Path lengths are typically optimal or close to optimal, and
	      the MN communicates normally with all other non-mobile hosts
	      (no stack or application changes), and of course other MNs.
	      Mapping changes are only needed when the MN uses a new TTR,
	      which would typically occur if the MN moved more than 1000
	      km.  Mapping changes are not required when the MN changes its
	      physical address(es).
	    </t>
	  </section>
	  <section title='Modified Header Forwarding'>
	    <t>
	      Separate schemes for IPv4 and IPv6 enable tunneling from ITR
	      to ETR without encapsulation.  This will remove the
	      encapsulation overhead and PMTUD problems.  Both approaches
	      involve modifying all routers between the ITR and ETR to
	      accept a modified form of the IP header.  These schemes
	      require new FIB/RIB functionality in DFZ and some other
	      routers but do not alter the BGP functions of DFZ routers.

	<t>
	  Looked at from the thousand-foot level, Ivip shares the basic
	  design approaches with LISP and a number of other map-and-encap
	  designs based on the Core-Edge Separation.  However, the details
	  differ substantially. Ivip's design makes a bold assumption that,
	  with technology advances, one could afford to maintain a
	  real-time distributed global mapping database for all networks
	  and hosts. Ivip proposes that multiple parties collaborate to
	  build a mapping distribution system that pushes all mapping
	  information and updates to local, full-database query servers
	  located in all ISPs within a few seconds.  The system has no
	  single point of failure and uses end-to-end authentication.
	</t>

	<t>
	  A "real time, globally synchronized mapping database" is a
	  critical assumption in Ivip. Using that as a foundation, Ivip
	  design avoids several challenging design issues that others have
	  studied extensively, that include
	  <list style='numbers'>
	    <t>
	      special considerations of mobility support that add
	      additional complexity to the overall system;
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      prompt detection of ETR failures and notification to all
	      relevant ITRs, which turns out to be a rather difficult
	      problem; and
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      development of a partial-mapping lookup sub-system. Ivip
	      assumes the existence of local query servers with a full
	      database with the latest mapping information changes.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>

	<t>
	  To be considered as a viable solution to the Internet routing
	  scalability problem, Ivip faces two fundamental questions.
	  First, whether a global-scale system can achieve real-time
	  synchronized operations as assumed by Ivip is an entirely open
	  question.  Past experiences suggest otherwise.
	</t>

	<t>
	  The second question concerns incremental rollout. Ivip represents
	  an ambitious approach, with real-time mapping and local
	  full-database query servers -- which many people regard as
	  impossible.  Developing and implementing Ivip may take a fair
	  amount of resources, yet there is an open question regarding how
	  to quantify the gains by first movers -- both those who will
	  provide the Ivip infrastructure and those that will use
	  it. Significant global routing table reduction only happens when
	  a large enough number of parties have adopted Ivip. The same
	  question arises for most other proposals as well.
	</t>

	<t>
	  One belief is that Ivip's more ambitious mapping system makes a
	  good design tradeoff for the greater benefits for end-user
	  networks and for those that develop the infrastructure. Another
	  belief is that this ambitious design is not viable.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Rebuttal'>
	<t>
	  Since the Summary and Critique were written, Ivip's mapping system
	  has been significantly redesigned: DRTM - Distributed Real Time
	  Mapping <xref target="Ivip_DRTM"/>.
	</t>
	<t>
	  DRTM makes it easier for ISPs to install their own ITRs.  It also
	  facilitates Mapped Address Block (MAB) operating companies --
	  which need not be ISPs -- leasing Scalable Provider-Independent
	  (SPI) address space to end-user networks with almost no ISP
	  involvement.  ISPs need not install ITRs or ETRs.  For an ISP to
	  support its customers using SPI space, they need only allow the
	  forwarding of outgoing packets whose source addresses are from
	  SPI space.  End-user networks can implement their own ETRs on
	  their existing PA address(es) -- and MAB operating companies make
	  all the initial investments.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Once SPI adoption becomes widespread, ISPs will be motivated to
	  install their own ITRs to locally tunnel packets that are sent from
	  customer networks and that must be tunneled to SPI-using customers
	  of the same ISP -- rather than letting these packets exit the
	  ISP's network and return in tunnels to ETRs in the network.
	</t>
	<t>
	  There is no need for full-database query servers in ISPs or for
	  any device that stores the full mapping information for all
	  Mapped Address Blocks (MABs).  ISPs that want ITRs will install
	  two or more Map Resolver (MR) servers.  These are caching query
	  servers which query multiple (typically nearby) query servers that
	  are full-database for the subset of MABs they serve.  These
	  "nearby" query servers will be at DITR sites, which will be run
	  by, or for, MAB operating companies who lease MAB space to large
	  numbers of end-user networks.  These DITR-site servers will
	  usually be close enough to the MRs to generate replies with
	  sufficiently low delay and risk of packet loss for ITRs to buffer
	  initial packets for a few tens of milliseconds while the mapping
	  arrives.
	</t>
	<t>
	  DRTM will scale to billions of micronets, tens of thousands of MABs,
	  and potentially hundreds of MAB operating companies, without single
	  points of failure or central coordination.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The critique implies a threshold of adoption is required before
	  significant routing scaling benefits occur.  This is untrue of any
	  Core-Edge Separation proposal, including LISP and Ivip.  Both can
	  achieve scalable routing benefits in direct proportion to their level
	  of adoption by providing portability, multihoming, and inbound TE to
	  large numbers of end-user networks.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Core-Edge Elimination (CEE) architectures require all Internet
	  communications to change to IPv6 with a new locator/identifier
	  separation naming model.  This would impose burdens of extra
	  management effort, packets, and session establishment delays on all
	  hosts -- which is a particularly unacceptable burden on
	  battery-operated mobile hosts that rely on wireless links.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Core-Edge Separation architectures retain the current, efficient,
	  naming model, require no changes to hosts, and support both IPv4 and
	  IPv6.  Ivip is the most promising architecture for future development
	  because its scalable, distributed, real-time mapping system best
	  supports TTR mobility, enables ITRs to be simpler, and gives real-time
	  control of ITR tunneling to the end-user network or to organizations
	  they appoint to control the mapping of their micronets.

    <section title="Hierarchical IPv4 Framework (hIPv4)">
      <section title='Summary'>
	<section title='Key Idea'>
	  <t>
	    The Hierarchical IPv4 Framework (hIPv4) adds scalability to the
	    routing architecture by introducing additional hierarchy in the
	    IPv4 address space. The IPv4 addressing scheme is divided into
	    two parts, the Area Locator (ALOC) address space, which is
	    globally unique, and the Endpoint Locator (ELOC) address space,
	    which is only regionally unique. The ALOC and ELOC prefixes are
	    added as a shim header between the IP header and transport
	    protocol header; the shim header is identified with a new
	    protocol number in the IP header. Instead of creating a
	    tunneling (i.e., overlay) solution, a new routing element is
	    needed in the service provider's routing domain (called ALOC
	    realm) -- a Locator Swap Router. The current IPv4 forwarding
	    plane remains intact, and no new routing protocols, mapping
	    systems, or caching solutions are required. The control plane
	    of the ALOC realm routers needs some modification in order for
	    ICMP to be compatible with the hIPv4 framework. When an area
	    (one or several autonomous systems (ASes)) of an ISP has
	    transformed into an ALOC realm, only ALOC prefixes are
	    exchanged with other ALOC realms. Directly attached ELOC
	    prefixes are only inserted to the RIB of the local ALOC realm;
	    ELOC prefixes are not distributed to the DFZ. Multihoming can
	    be achieved in two ways, either the enterprise requests an ALOC
	    prefix from the RIR (this is not recommended) or the enterprise
	    receives the ALOC prefixes from their upstream ISPs.  ELOC
	    prefixes are PI addresses and remain intact when an upstream
	    ISP is changed; only the ALOC prefix is replaced. When the RIB
	    of the DFZ is compressed (containing only ALOC prefixes),
	    ingress routers will no longer know the availability of the

	    responsibility for their sessions. This can be achieved by
	    using multipath enabled transport protocols, such as SCTP
	    <xref target='RFC4960'/> and Multipath TCP (MPTCP)
	    <xref target='MPTCP_Arch'/>, at the endpoints. The multipath
	    transport protocols also provide a session identifier, i.e.,
	    verification tag or token; thus, the location and identifier
	    split is carried out -- site mobility, endpoint mobility, and
	    mobile site mobility are achieved. DNS needs to be upgraded: in
	    order to resolve the location of an endpoint, the endpoint must
	    have one ELOC value (current A-record) and at least one ALOC
	    value in DNS (in multihoming solutions there will be several
	    ALOC values for an endpoint).

		Improved routing scalability: Adding additional hierarchy

		Decoupling Location and Identifier: The verification tag

	  hIPv4 is an innovative approach to expanding the IPv4 addressing
	  system in order to resolve the scalable routing problem.  This
	  critique does not attempt a full assessment of hIPv4's architecture
	  and mechanisms.  The only question addressed here is whether hIPv4
	  should be chosen for IETF development in preference to, or together
	  with, the only two proposals which appear to be practical solutions
	  for IPv4: Ivip and LISP.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Ivip and LISP appear to have a major advantage over hIPv4 in
	  terms of support for packets sent from non-upgraded
	  hosts/networks.  Ivip's DITRs (Default ITRs in the DFZ) and
	  LISP's PTRs (Proxy Tunnel Routers) both accept packets sent by
	  any non-upgraded host/network and tunnel them to the correct ETR
	  -- thus providing the full benefits of portability, multihoming,
	  and inbound TE for these packets as well as those sent by hosts
	  in networks with ITRs.  hIPv4 appears to have no such mechanism,
	  so these benefits are only available for communications between
	  two upgraded hosts in upgraded networks.
	</t>
	<t>
	  This means that significant benefits for adopters -- the ability
	  to rely on the new system to provide the portability, multihoming,
	  and inbound TE benefits for all, or almost all, their
	  communications -- will only arise after all, or almost all,
	  networks upgrade their networks, hosts, and addressing
	  arrangements.  hIPv4's relationship between adoption levels and
	  benefits to any adopter therefore are far less favorable to
	  widespread adoption than those of Core-Edge Separation (CES)
	  architectures such as Ivip and LISP.
	</t>
	<t>
	  This results in hIPv4 also being at a disadvantage regarding the
	  achievement of significant routing scaling benefits, which likewise
	  will only result once adoption is close to ubiquitous.  Ivip and LISP
	  can provide routing scaling benefits in direct proportion to their
	  level of adoption, since all adopters gain full benefits for all
	  their communications, in a highly scalable manner.
	</t>
	<t>
	  hIPv4 requires stack upgrades, which are not required by any CES
	  architecture.  Furthermore, a large number of existing IPv4
	  application protocols convey IP addresses between hosts in a manner
	  that will not work with hIPv4:  "There are several applications that
	  are inserting IP address information in the payload of a packet.
	  Some applications use the IP address information to create new
	  sessions or for identification purposes. This section is trying to
	  list the applications that need to be enhanced; however, this is by
	  no means a comprehensive list" <xref target='hIPv4'/>.
	</t>
	<t>
	  If even a few widely used applications would need to be rewritten to
	  operate successfully with hIPv4, then this would be such a
	  disincentive to adoption to rule out hIPv4 ever being adopted widely
	  enough to solve the routing scaling problem, especially since CES
	  architectures fully support all existing protocols, without the need
	  for altering host stacks.
	</t>
	<t>
	  It appears that hIPv4 involves major practical difficulties, which
	  mean that in its current form it is not suitable for IETF
	  development.

	    At the edge network, we introduce a new type of gateway, a Name
	    Transfer Relay (NTR), which blocks the PI addresses of edge
	    networks into upstream transit networks.  NTRs perform address
	    and/or port translation between blocked PI addresses and
	    globally routable addresses, which seem like today's widely
	    used NAT / Network Address Port Translation (NAPT) devices.
	    Both legacy and NOL applications behind a NTR can access the
	    outside as usual. To access the hosts behind a NTR from
	    outside, we need to use NOL to traverse the NTR by name and
	    initiate connections to the hosts behind it.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    Different from proposed host-based ID/locator split solutions,
	    such as HIP, Shim6, and name-oriented stack, NOL doesn't need
	    to change the existing TCP/IP stack, sockets, or their packet
	    formats. NOL can coexist with the legacy infrastructure, and
	    the Core-Edge Separation solutions (e.g., APT, LISP, Six/One,

	      Applications on hosts need to be rebuilt based on a name
	      overlay library to be NOL-enabled. The legacy software that
	      is not maintained will not be able to benefit from NOL in the
	      Core-Edge Elimination situation. In the Core-Edge Separation
	      scheme, a new gateway NTR is deployed to prevent
	      edge-specific PI prefixes from leaking into the transit
	      core. NOL doesn't impede the legacy endpoints behind the NTR
	      from accessing the outside Internet, but the legacy endpoints
	      cannot access or will have difficultly accessing the
	      endpoints behind a NTR without the help of NOL.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      In the case of Core-Edge Elimination, the end site will be
	      assigned multiple PA address spaces, which leads to
	      renumbering troubles when switching to other upstream
	      providers. Upgrading endpoints to support NOL doesn't give
	      any benefits to edge networks. Endpoints have little
	      incentive to use NOL in a Core-Edge Elimination scenario, and
	      the same is true with other host-based ID/locator split
	      proposals. Whether they are IPv4 or IPv6 networks, edge
	      networks prefer PI address space to PA address space.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      In the Core-Edge Separation scenario, the additional gateway
	      NTR is to prevent the specific prefixes from the edge
	      networks, just like a NAT or the ITR/ETR of LISP. A NTR
	      gateway can be seen as an extension of NAT (Network Address
	      Translation). Although NATs are deployed widely, upgrading
	      them to support NOL extension or deploying additional new
	      gateway NTRs at the edge networks is on a voluntary basis
	      and has few economic incentives.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      The stateful or stateless translation for each packet
	      traversing a NTR will require the cost of the CPU and memory
	      of NTRs, and increase forwarding delay. Thus, it is not
	      appropriate to deploy NTRs at the high-level transit networks
	      where aggregated traffic may cause congestion at the NTRs.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      In the Core-Edge Separation scenario, the requirement for
	      multihoming and inter-domain traffic engineering will make
	      end sites accessible via multiple different NTRs. For
	      reliability, all of the associations between multiple NTRs and
	      the end site name will be kept in DNS, which may increase the
	      load on DNS.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      To support mobility, it is necessary for DNS to update the
	      corresponding name-NTR mapping records when an end system
	      moves from behind one NTR to another NTR. The NOL-enabled end
	      relies on the NOL layer to preserve the continuity of the
	      transport layer, since the underlying TCP/UDP transport
	      session would be broken when the IP address changed.

	  NOL resembles neither CEE nor CES as a solution. By supporting
	  application-level sessions through the name overlay layer, NOL can
	  support some solutions in the CEE style.  However, NOL is in
	  general closer to CES solutions, i.e., preventing PI prefixes of
	  edge networks from entering into the upstream transit networks.
	  This is done by the NTR, like the ITRs/ETRs in CES solutions, but
	  NOL has no need to define the clear boundary between core and
	  edge networks.  NOL is designed to try to provide end users or
	  networks a service that facilitates the adoption of multihoming,
	  multipath routing, and traffic engineering by the indirect routing
	  through NTRs, and that, in the mean time, doesn't accelerate or
	  decelerate the growth of global routing table size.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Some problems are described in the NOL critique. In the original
	  NOL proposal document, the DNS query for a host that is behind a
	  NTR will induce the return of the actual IP addresses of the host
	  and the address of the NTR. This arrangement might cause some
	  difficulties for legacy applications due to the non-standard
	  response from DNS. To resolve this problem, we instead have the
	  NOL service use a new namespace, and have DNS not return NTR IP
	  addresses for the legacy hosts. The names used for NOL are
	  formatted like email addresses, such as "des@example.net".  The
	  mapping between "example.net" and the IP address of the
	  corresponding NTR will be registered in DNS. The NOL layer will
	  understand the meaning of the name "des@example.net" , and it
	  will send a query to DNS only for "example.net".  DNS will then
	  return IP addresses of the corresponding NTRs.  Legacy
	  applications will still use the traditional FQDN name, and DNS
	  will return the actual IP address of the host. However, if the
	  host is behind a NTR, the legacy applications may be unable to
	  access the host.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The stateless address translation or stateful address and port
	  translation may cause a scaling problem with the number of table
	  entries NTR must maintain, and legacy applications cannot
	  initiate sessions with hosts inside the NOL-adopting End User
	  Network (EUN). However, these problems may not be a big barrier
	  for the deployment of NOL or other similar approaches. Many
	  NAT-like boxes, proxy, and firewall devices are widely used at
	  the ingress/egress points of enterprise networks, campus networks,
	  or other stub EUNs.  The hosts running as servers can be deployed
	  outside NTRs or can be assigned PA addresses in an NTR-adopting EUN.

	<t>
	  The CRM proposal is not a complete proposal and therefore cannot
	  be considered for further development by the IETF as a scalable
	  routing solution.
	</t>
	<t>
	  While Compact Routing principles may be able to improve a mapping
	  overlay structure such as LISP+ALT, there are several objections
	  to this approach.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Firstly, a CRM-modified ALT structure would still be a global
	  query server system.  No matter how ALT's path lengths and delays
	  are optimized, there is a problem with a querier -- which could be
	  anywhere in the world -- relying on mapping information from one
	  or ideally two or more authoritative query servers, which could
	  also be anywhere in the world.  The delays and risks of packet
	  loss that are inherent in such a system constitute a fundamental
	  problem. This is especially true when multiple, potentially long,
	  traffic streams are received by ITRs and forwarded over the CRM
	  networks for delivery to the destination network.  ITRs must use
	  the CRM infrastructure while they are awaiting a map reply.  The
	  traffic forwarded on the CRM infrastructure functions as map
	  requests and can present a scalability and performance issue to
	  the infrastructure.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Secondly, the alterations contemplated in this proposal involve
	  the roles of particular nodes in the network being dynamically
	  assigned as part of the network's self-organizing nature.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The discussion of clustering in the middle of page 4 of
	  <xref target="CRM"/> also
	  indicates that particular nodes are responsible for registering
	  EIDs from typically far-distant ETRs, all of which are handling
	  closely related EIDs that this node can aggregate.  Since MSes
	  are apparently nodes within the compact routing system, and the
	  process of an MS deciding whether to accept EID registrations is
	  determined as part of the self-organizing properties of the
	  system, there are concerns about how EID registration can be
	  performed securely, when no particular physical node is
	  responsible for it.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Thirdly, there are concerns about individually owned nodes
	  performing work for other organizations.  Such problems of trust
	  and of responsibilities and costs being placed on those who do
	  not directly benefit already exist in the inter-domain routing
	  system and are a challenge for any scalable routing solution.
	</t>
	<t>
	  There are simpler solutions to the mapping problem than having an
	  elaborate network of routers.  If a global-scale query system is
	  still preferred, then it would be better to have ITRs use local
	  MRs, each of which is dynamically configured to know the IP
	  address of the million or so authoritative Map Server (MS) query
	  servers -- or two million or so assuming they exist in pairs for
	  redundancy.
	</t>
	<t>
	  It appears that the inherently greater delays and risks of packet
	  loss of global query server systems make them unsuitable
	  mapping solutions for Core-Edge Elimination or Core-Edge
	  Separation architectures.  The solution to these problems appears
	  to involve a greater number of widely distributed authoritative
	  query servers, one or more of which will therefore be close
	  enough to each querier that delays and risk of packet loss are
	  reduced to acceptable levels.  Such a structure would be suitable
	  for map requests, but perhaps not for handling traffic packets to
	  be delivered to the destination networks.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Rebuttal'>
	<t>
	  CRM is most easily understood as an alteration to the routing
	  structure of the LISP+ALT mapping overlay system, by altering or
	  adding to the network's BGP control plane.
	</t>
	<t>
	  CRM's aims include the delivery of initial traffic packets to
	  their destination networks where they also function as map
	  requests.  These packet streams may be long and numerous in the
	  fractions of a second to perhaps several seconds that may elapse
	  before the ITR receives the map reply.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Compact Routing principles are used to optimize the path length
	  taken by these query or traffic packets through a significantly
	  modified version of the ALT (or similar) network, while also
	  generally reducing typical or maximum paths taken by the query
	  packets.

	<t>
	  LMS is a mapping mechanism based on Core-Edge Separation. In
	  fact, any proposal that needs a global mapping system with keys
	  with similar properties to that of an "edge address" in a
	  Core-Edge Separation scenario can use such a mechanism. This
	  means that those keys are globally unique (by authorization or
	  just statistically), at the disposal of edge users, and may have
	  several satisfied mappings (with possibly different weights).  A
	  proposal to address routing scalability that needs mapping but
	  doesn't specify the mapping mechanism can use LMS to strengthen
	  its infrastructure.
	</t>

	<t>
	  The key idea of LMS is similar to that of LISP+ALT: that the
	  mapping system should be hierarchically organized to gain
	  scalability for storage and updates and to achieve quick
	  indexing for lookups. However, LMS advocates an ISP-independent
	  mapping system, and ETRs are not the authorities of mapping
	  data. ETRs or edge-sites report their mapping data to related
	  mapping servers.
	</t>

	<t>
	  LMS assumes that mapping servers can be incrementally deployed in
	  that a server may not be constructed if none of its administered
	  edge addresses are allocated, and that mapping servers can charge
	  for their services, which provides the economic incentive for
	  their existence.  How this brand-new system can be constructed is
	  still not clear. Explicit layering is only an ideal state, and
	  the proposal analyzes the layering limits and feasibility, rather
	  than provide a practical way for deployment.
	</t>

	<t>
	  The drawbacks of LMS's feasibility analysis also include that it
	  1) is based on current PC power and may not represent future
	  circumstances (especially for IPv6), and 2) does not consider the
	  variability of address utilization. Some IP address spaces may be
	  effectively allocated and used while some may not, causing some
	  mapping servers to be overloaded while others are poorly
	  utilized. More thoughts are needed as to the flexibility of the
	  layer design.
	</t>

	<t>
	  LMS doesn't fit well for mobility. It does not solve the problem
	  when hosts move faster than the mapping updates and propagation
	  between relative mapping servers. On the other hand,  mobile hosts'
	  moving across ASes and changing their attachment points (core
	  addresses) is less frequent than hosts' moving within an AS.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Separation needs two planes: Core-Edge Separation (which is to
	  gain routing table scalability) and identity/location separation
	  (which is to achieve mobility). The Global Locator, Local
	  Locator, and Identifier (GLI) scheme does a good clarification of
	  this, and in that case, LMS can be used to provide
	  identity-to-core address mapping. Of course, other schemes may be
	  competent, and LMS can be incorporated with them if the scheme has
	  global keys and needs to map them to other namespaces.

       title='Global Locator, Local Locator, and Identifier Split (GLI-Split)'>
      <section title='Summary'>
	<section title='Key Idea'>
	  <t>
	    GLI-Split implements a separation between global routing (in
	    the global Internet outside edge networks) and local routing
	    (inside edge networks) using global and local locators (GLs and
	    LLs). In addition, a separate static identifier (ID) is used to
	    identify communication endpoints (e.g., nodes or services)
	    independently of any routing information. Locators and IDs are
	    encoded in IPv6 addresses to enable backwards-compatibility
	    with the IPv6 Internet. The higher-order bits store either a GL
	    or a LL, while the lower-order bits contain the ID. A local
	    mapping system maps IDs to LLs, and a global mapping system
	    maps IDs to GLs. The full GLI-mode requires nodes with upgraded
	    networking stacks and special GLI-gateways. The GLI-gateways
	    perform stateless locator rewriting in IPv6 addresses with the
	    help of the local and global mapping system. Non-upgraded IPv6
	    nodes can also be accommodated in GLI-domains since an enhanced
	    DHCP service and GLI-gateways compensate for their missing
	    GLI-functionality. This is an important feature for incremental
	    deployability.

	    The benefits of GLI-Split are:

	      <t>

		Internet through separation of edge and core routing
	      </t>

	<t>
	  GLI-Split makes a clear distinction between two separation
	  planes: the separation between identifier and locator (which is
	  to meet end-users' needs including mobility) and the separation
	  between local and global locator (which makes the global routing
	  table scalable). The distinction is needed since ISPs and hosts
	  have different requirements, with both needing to make the
	  changes inside and outside GLI-domains invisible to their
	  opposites.
	</t>

	<t>
	  A main drawback of GLI-Split is that it puts a burden on
	  hosts. Before routing a packet received from upper layers,
	  network stacks in hosts first need to resolve the DNS name to an
	  IP address; if the IP address is GLI-formed, it may look up the
	  map from the identifier extracted from the IP address to the
	  local locator. If the communication is between different
	  GLI-domains, hosts may further look up the mapping from the
	  identifier to the global locator. Having the local mapping system
	  forward requests to the global mapping system for hosts is just
	  an option. Though host lookup may ease the burden of intermediate
	  nodes, which would otherwise to perform the mapping lookup, the
	  three lookups by hosts in the worst case may lead to large delays
	  unless a very efficient mapping mechanism is devised. The work
	  may also become impractical for low-powered hosts. On one hand,
	  GLI-Split can provide backward compatibility where classic and
	  upgraded IPv6 hosts can communicate. This is its big virtue. On
	  the other hand, the need to upgrade may work against hosts'
	  enthusiasm to change. This is offset against the benefits they
	  would gain.
	</t>

	<t>
	  GLI-Split provides additional features to improve TE and to
	  improve resilience, e.g., exerting multipath routing. However, the
	  cost is that more burdens are placed on hosts, e.g., they may need
	  more lookup actions and route selections. However, these kinds of
	  tradeoffs between costs and gains exist in most proposals.
	</t>

	<t>
	  One improvement of GLI-Split is its support for mobility by
	  updating DNS data as GLI-hosts move across GLI-domains. Through
	  this, the GLI-corresponding-node can query DNS to get a valid
	  global locator of the GLI-mobile-node and need not query the
	  global mapping system (unless it wants to do multipath routing),
	  giving more incentives for nodes to become GLI-enabled. The
	  merits of GLI-Split, including simplified-mobility-handover
	  provision, compensate for the costs of this improvement.
	</t>

	<t>
	  GLI-Split claims to use rewriting instead of tunneling for
	  conversions between local and global locators when packets span
	  GLI-domains. The major advantage is that this kind of rewriting
	  needs no extra state, since local and global locators need not
	  map to each other. Many other rewriting mechanisms instead need
	  to maintain extra state. It also avoids the MTU problem faced by
	  the tunneling methods. However, GLI-Split achieves this only by
	  compressing the namespace size of each attribute (identifier and
	  local/global locator). GLI-Split encodes two namespaces
	  (identifier and local/global locator) into an IPv6 address (each
	  has a size of 2^64 or less), while map-and-encap proposals assume
	  that identifier and locator each occupy a 128-bit space.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Rebuttal'>
	<t>
	  The arguments in the GLI-Split critique are correct. There are
	  only two points that should be clarified here. First, it is
	  not a drawback that hosts perform the mapping lookups. 
	  Second, the critique proposed an improvement to the mobility
	  mechanism, which is of a general nature and not specific to
	  GLI-Split.
	</t>
	<t>
	  <list style='numbers'>
	    <t>
	      The additional burden on the hosts is actually a benefit,
	      compared to having the same burden on the gateways. If the
	      gateway would perform the lookups and packets addressed to
	      uncached EIDs arrive, a lookup in the mapping system must be
	      initiated. Until the mapping reply returns, packets must be
	      either dropped, cached, or sent over the
	      mapping system to the destination. All these options are not
	      optimal and have their drawbacks. To avoid these problems in
	      GLI-Split, the hosts perform the lookup. The short additional
	      delay is not a big issue in the hosts because it happens
	      before the first packets are sent. So, no packets are lost or
	      have to be cached. GLI-Split could also easily be adapted to
	      special GLI-hosts (e.g., low-power sensor nodes) that do not
	      have to do any lookup and simply let the gateway do all the
	      work. This functionality is included anyway for backward
	      compatibility with regular IPv6 hosts inside the GLI-domain.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The critique proposes a DNS-based mobility mechanism as
	      an improvement to GLI-Split. However, this improvement is an
	      alternative mobility approach that can be applied to any
	      routing architecture (including GLI-Split) and also raises some
	      concerns, e.g., the update speed of DNS. Therefore, we prefer
	      to keep this issue out of the discussion.

	  For a TIDR-using network to receive packets sent from any host,
	  every BR of all ISPs must be upgraded to have the new ITR-like
	  functionality.  Furthermore, all DFZ routers would need to be
	  altered so they accepted and correctly propagated the routes for
	  end-user network address space, with the new LOCATOR
	  attribute,
	  which contains the ETR address and a REMOTE-PREFERENCE value.
	  Firstly, if they received two such advertisements with different
	  LOCATORs, they would advertise a single route to this prefix
	  containing both.  Secondly, for end-user address space (for IPv4)
	  to be more finely divided, the DFZ routers must propagate
	  LOCATOR-containing advertisements for prefixes longer than /24.
	</t>
	<t>
	  TIDR's ITR-like routers store the full mapping database -- so
	  there would be no delay in obtaining mapping, and therefore no
	  significant delay in tunneling traffic packets.
	</t>
	<t>
	  <xref target="TIDR"/> is written as if traffic packets are
	  classified by reference to the RIB, but routers use the FIB for
	  this purpose, and "FIB" does not appear in <xref target="TIDR"/>.
	</t>
	<t>
	  TIDR does not specify a tunneling technique, leaving this to be
	  chosen by the ETR-like function of BRs and specified as part of a
	  second kind of new BGP route advertised by that ETR-like BR.
	  There is no provision for solving the PMTUD problems inherent in
	  encapsulation-based tunneling.
	</t>
	<t>
	  ITR functions must be performed by already busy routers of ISPs,
	  rather than being distributed to other routers or to sending
	  hosts.  There is no practical support for mobility.  The mapping
	  in each end-user route advertisement includes a REMOTE-PREFERENCE
	  for each ETR-like BR, but this is used by the ITR-like functions
	  of BRs to always select the LOCATOR with the highest value.  As
	  currently described, TIDR does not provide inbound load-splitting
	  TE.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Multihoming service restoration is achieved initially by the
	  ETR-like function of the BR at the ISP (whose link to the end-user
	  network has just failed). It looks up the mapping to find the next
	  preferred ETR-like BR's address.  The first ETR-like router
	  tunnels the packets to the second ETR-like router in the other
	  ISP.  However, if the failure was caused by the first ISP itself
	  being unreachable, then connectivity would not be restored until
	  a revised mapping (with higher REMOTE-PREFERENCE) from the
	  reachable ETR-like BR of the second ISP propagated across the DFZ
	  to all ITR-like routers, or the withdrawn advertisement for the
	  first one reaches the ITR-like router.

      <section title='Critique'>
	<t>
	  The primary issue for ILNP is how the deployment incentives and
	  benefits line up with the RRG goal of reducing the rate of growth
	  of entries and churn in the core routing table.  If a site is
	  currently using PI space, it can only stop advertising that space
	  when the entire site is ILNP capable.  This needs (at least) clear
	  elucidation of the incentives for ILNP which are not related to
	  routing scaling, in order for there to be a path for this to
	  address the RRG needs.  Similarly, the incentives for upgrading
	  hosts need to align with the value for those hosts.
	</t>

	<t>
	  A closely related question is whether this mechanism actually
	  addresses the sites need for PI addresses.  Assuming ILNP is
	  deployed, the site does achieve flexible, resilient,
	  communication using all of its Internet connections.  While the
	  proposal addresses the host updates when the host learns of
	  provider changes, there are other aspects of provider change that
	  are not addressed.  This includes renumbering routers, subnets,
	  and certain servers.  (It is presumed that most servers, once the
	  entire site has moved to ILNP, will not be concerned if their
	  locator changes.  However, some servers must have known locators,
	  such as the DNS server.)  The issues described in
	  <xref target='RFC5887'/> will be ameliorated, but not resolved.
	  To be able to adopt this proposal, and have sites use it, we need
	  to address these issues.  When a site changes points of
	  attachment, only a small amount of DNS provisioning should be
	  required.  The LP resource record type is apparently intended to
	  help with this.  It is also likely that the use of dynamic DNS
	  will help this.
	</t>

	<t>
	  The ILNP mechanism is described as being suitable for use in
	  conjunction with mobility.  This raises the question of race
	  conditions.  To the degree that mobility concerns are valid at
	  this time, it is worth asking how communication can be
	  established if a node is sufficiently mobile that it is moving
	  faster than the DNS update and DNS fetch cycle can effectively
	  propagate changes.
	</t>

	<t>
	  This proposal does presume that all communication using this
	  mechanism is tied to DNS names.  While it is true that most
	  communication does start from a DNS name, it is not the case that
	  all exchanges have this property.  Some communication initiation
	  and referral can be done with an explicit identifier/locator pair.  This does
	  appear to require some extensions to the existing mechanism (for
	  both sides to add locators).  In general, some additional clarity
	  on the assumptions regarding DNS, particularly for low-end
	  devices, would seem appropriate.
	</t>

	<t>
	  One issue that this proposal shares with many others is the
	  question of how to determine which locator pairs (local and
	  remote) are actually functional.  This is an issue both for
	  initial communications establishment and for robustly
	  maintaining communication.  It is likely that a combination
	  of monitoring of traffic (in the host, where this is tractable),
	  coupled with other active measures, can address this.  ICMP is
	  clearly insufficient.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Rebuttal'>
	<t>
	  ILNP eliminates the perceived need for PI addressing
	  and encourages increased DFZ aggregation. Many enterprise users 
	  view DFZ scaling issues as too abstruse, so ILNP creates 
	  more user-visible incentives to upgrade deployed systems.
	</t>
	<t>
	  ILNP mobility eliminates Duplicate Address Detection (DAD),
	  reducing the layer-3 handoff time significantly when compared to IETF
	  standard Mobile IP, as shown in <xref target='MobiArch1'/> and
	  <xref target='MobiArch2'/>. ICMP location updates separately
	  reduce the layer-3 handoff latency.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Also, ILNP enables both host multihoming and site 
	  multihoming.  Current BGP approaches cannot support 
	  host multihoming.  Host multihoming is valuable in
	  reducing the site's set of externally visible nodes.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Improved mobility support is very important.  This is shown 
	  by the research literature and also appears in discussions 
	  with vendors of mobile devices (smartphones, MP3 players).  
	  Several operating system vendors push "updates" with major 
	  networking software changes in maintenance releases today.
	  Security concerns mean most hosts receive vendor updates 
	  more quickly these days.
	</t>
	<t>
	  ILNP enables a site to hide exterior connectivity changes from
	  interior nodes, using various approaches.  One approach deploys
	  unique local address (ULA) prefixes within the site, and has the
	  site border router(s) rewrite the Locator values.  The usual NAT
	  issues don't arise because the Locator value is not used above
	  the network-layer. <xref target='MILCOM1'/>
	  <xref target='MILCOM2'/>
	</t>
	<t>
	  <xref target='RFC5902'/> makes clear that many users 
	  desire IPv6 NAT, with site interior obfuscation as a
	  major driver.  This makes global-scope PI addressing much
	  less desirable for end sites than formerly.
	</t>
	<t>
	  ILNP-capable nodes can talk existing IP with legacy 
	  IP-only nodes, with no loss of current IP capability.  
	  So, ILNP-capable nodes will never be worse off.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Secure Dynamic DNS Update is standard and widely supported in
	  deployed hosts and DNS servers.  <xref target='DNSnBIND'/> says
	  many sites have deployed this technology without realizing it
	  (e.g., by enabling both the DHCP server and Active Directory of
	  the MS-Windows Server).
	</t>
	<t>
	  If a node is as mobile as the critique says, then existing 
	  IETF Mobile IP standards also will fail.  They also use 
	  location updates (e.g., MN -> home agent, MN -> foreign agent).  
	</t>
	<t>
	  ILNP also enables new approaches to security that eliminate
	  dependence upon location-dependent Access Control Lists (ACLs)
	  without packet authentication.  Instead, security appliances
	  track flows using Identifier values and validate the
	  identifier/locator relationship cryptographically
	  <xref target='RFC4033'/> <xref target='RFC4034'/>
	  <xref target='RFC4035'/> or non-cryptographically by reading the
	  nonce <xref target='ILNP_Nonce'/>.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The DNS LP record has a more detailed explanation now.
	  LP records enable a site to change its upstream connectivity
	  by changing the L resource records of a single FQDN covering the
	  whole site, thereby providing scalability.
	</t>
	<t>
	  DNS-based server load balancing works well with ILNP by using DNS
	  SRV records.  DNS SRV records are not new, are widely available
	  in DNS clients and servers, and are widely used today in the
	  IPv4 Internet for server load balancing.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Recent ILNP documents discuss referrals in more detail.  A node with a
	  binary referral can find the FQDN using DNS PTR records, which
	  can be authenticated <xref target='RFC4033'/>
	  <xref target='RFC4034'/> <xref target='RFC4035'/>.  Approaches
	  such as <xref target='Referral_Obj'/>
	  improve user experience and user capability, so are likely to
	  self-deploy.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Selection from multiple Locators is identical to an 
	  IPv4 system selecting from multiple A records for its 
	  correspondent.  Deployed IP nodes can track reachability 
	  via existing host mechanisms or by using the SHIM6 method.

    <section title='Enhanced Efficiency of Mapping Distribution Protocols
		    in Map-and-Encap Schemes (EEMDP)'>
      <section title='Summary'>
	<section title='Introduction'>
	  <t>
	    We present some architectural principles pertaining to the
	    mapping distribution protocols, especially applicable to the
	    map-and-encap (e.g., LISP) type of protocols. These principles
	    enhance the efficiency of the map-and-encap protocols in terms
	    of (1) better utilization of resources (e.g., processing and
	    memory) at Ingress Tunnel Routers (ITRs) and mapping servers,
	    and consequently, (2) reduction of response time (e.g., first-packet delay). We consider how Egress Tunnel Routers (ETRs) can
	    perform aggregation of endpoint ID (EID) address space
	    belonging to their downstream delivery networks, in spite of
	    migration/re-homing of some subprefixes to other ETRs. This
	    aggregation may be useful for reducing the processing load and
	    memory consumption associated with map messages, especially at
	    some resource-constrained ITRs and subsystems of the mapping
	    distribution system. We also consider another architectural
	    concept where the ETRs are organized in a hierarchical manner
	    for the potential benefit of aggregation of their EID address
	    spaces. The two key architectural ideas are discussed in some
	    more detail below. A more complete description can be found in
	    <xref target='EEMDP_Considerations'/> and
	    <xref target='EEMDP_Presentation'/>.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    It will be helpful to refer to Figures 1, 2, and 3 in <xref target='EEMDP_Considerations'/> for some of the discussions that follow here
	    below.
	  </t>
	</section>

	<section title='Management of Mapping Distribution of Subprefixes
			Spread across Multiple ETRs'>
	  <t>
	    To assist in this discussion, we start with the high level
	    architecture of a map-and-encap approach (it would be helpful to
	    see Figure 1 in <xref target='EEMDP_Considerations'/>). In this architecture,
	    we have the usual ITRs, ETRs, delivery networks, etc. In
	    addition, we have the ID-Locator Mapping (ILM) servers, which are
	    repositories for complete mapping information, while the
	    ILM-Regional (ILM-R) servers can contain partial and/or
	    regionally relevant mapping information.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    While a large endpoint address space contained in a prefix may be
	    mostly associated with the delivery networks served by one ETR,
	    some fragments (subprefixes) of that address space may be located
	    elsewhere at other ETRs. Let a/20 denote a prefix that is
	    conceptually viewed as composed of 16 subnets of /24 size that
	    are denoted as a1/24, a2/24, ..., a16/24. For example, a/20 is
	    mostly at ETR1, while only two of its subprefixes a8/24 and
	    a15/24 are elsewhere at ETR3 and ETR2, respectively (see Figure 2
	    <xref target='EEMDP_Considerations'/>). From the point of view of efficiency of the
	    mapping distribution protocol, it may be beneficial for ETR1 to
	    announce a map for the entire space a/20 (rather than fragment it
	    into a multitude of more-specific prefixes), and provide the
	    necessary exceptions in the map information. Thus, the map message
	    could be in the form of Map:(a/20, ETR1; Exceptions: a8/24,
	    a15/24). In addition, ETR2 and ETR3 announce the maps for a15/24
	    and a8/24, respectively, and so the ILMs know where the exception
	    EID addresses are located. Now consider a host associated with
	    ITR1 initiating a packet destined for an address a7(1), which is
	    in a7/24 that is not in the exception portion of a/20. Now a
	    question arises as to which of the following approaches would be
	    the best choice:
	    <list style='numbers'>
	      <t>
		ILM-R provides the complete mapping information for a/20 to
		ITR1 including all maps for relevant exception subprefixes.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		ILM-R provides only the directly relevant map to ITR1, which
		in this case is (a/20, ETR1).
	      </t>
	    </list>
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    In the first approach, the advantage is that ITR1 would have the
	    complete mapping for a/20 (including exception subnets), and it
	    would not have to generate queries for subsequent first packets
	    that are destined to any address in a/20, including a8/24 and
	    a15/24. However, the disadvantage is that if there is a
	    significant number of exception subprefixes, then the very first
	    packet destined for a/20 will experience a long delay, and also
	    the processors at ITR1 and ILM-R can experience overload. In
	    addition, the memory usage at ITR1 can be very inefficient. The advantage of the second approach above is that the
	    ILM-R does not overload resources at ITR1, neither in terms of
	    processing or memory usage, but it needs an enhanced map response
	    in of the form Map:(a/20, ETR1, MS=1), where the MS (More Specific)
	    indicator is set to 1 to indicate to ITR1 that not all subnets in
	    a/20 map to ETR1. The key idea is that aggregation is beneficial,
	    and subnet exceptions must be handled with additional messages or
	    indicators in the maps.
	  </t>
	</section>
	<section title='Management of Mapping Distribution for Scenarios with
			Hierarchy of ETRs and Multihoming'>
	  <t>
	    Now we highlight another architectural concept related to
	    mapping management (please refer to Figure 3 in <xref target='EEMDP_Considerations'/>). Here we consider the possibility that ETRs may be
	    organized in a hierarchical manner. For instance, ETR7 is higher
	    in the hierarchy relative to ETR1, ETR2, and ETR3, and like-wise
	    ETR8 is higher relative to ETR4, ETR5, and ETR6. For instance,
	    ETRs 1 through 3 can relegate the locator role to ETR7 for
	    their EID address space. In essence, they can allow ETR7 to act
	    as the locator for the delivery networks in their purview. ETR7
	    keeps a local mapping table for mapping the appropriate EID
	    address space to specific ETRs that are hierarchically
	    associated with it in the level below. In this situation, ETR7
	    can perform EID address space aggregation across ETRs 1 through
	    3 and can also include its own immediate EID address space for
	    the purpose of that aggregation. The many details related to
	    this approach and special circumstances involving multihoming
	    of subnets are discussed in detail in <xref target='EEMDP_Considerations'/>. The hierarchical organization of ETRs and
	    delivery networks should help in the future growth and
	    scalability of ETRs and mapping distribution networks. This is
	    essentially recursive map-and-encap, and some of the mapping
	    distribution and management functionality will remain local to
	    topologically neighboring delivery networks that are
	    hierarchically underneath ETRs.

      <section title='Critique'>
	<t>
	  The scheme described in <xref target='EEMDP_Considerations'/> represents one
	  approach to mapping overhead reduction, and it is a general idea
	  that is applicable to any proposal that includes prefix or EID
	  aggregation. A somewhat similar idea is also used in Level-3
	  aggregation in the FIB aggregation proposal
	  <xref target='FIBAggregatability'/>. There can be cases where
	  deaggregation of EID prefixes occur in such a way that the bulk of an
	  EID prefix P would be attached to one locator (say, ETR1) while a
	  few subprefixes under P would be attached to other locators
	  elsewhere (say, ETR2, ETR3, etc.). Ideally, such cases should not
	  happen; however, in reality it can happen as the RIR's address
	  allocations are imperfect. In addition, as new IP address
	  allocations become harder to get, an IPv4 prefix owner might
	  split previously unused subprefixes of that prefix and allocate
	  them to remote sites (homed to other ETRs). Assuming these
	  situations could arise in practice, the nature of the solution
	  would be that the response from the mapping server for the
	  coarser site would include information about the more
	  specifics. The solution as presented seems correct.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The proposal mentions that in Approach 1, the ID-Locator Mapping
	  (ILM) system provides the complete mapping information for an
	  aggregate EID prefix to a querying ITR, including all the maps for
	  the relevant exception subprefixes. The sheer number of such
	  more-specifics can be worrisome, for example, in LISP. What if a
	  company's mobile-node EIDs came out of their corporate
	  EID prefix? Approach 2 is far better but still there may be too
	  many entries for a regional ILM to store. In Approach 2, the ILM
	  communicates that there are more specifics but does not
	  communicate their mask-length. A suggested improvement would be
	  that rather than saying that there are more specifics, indicate
	  what their mask-lengths are. There can be multiple mask
	  lengths. This number should be pretty small for IPv4 but can
	  be large for IPv6.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Later in the proposal, a different problem is addressed,
	  involving a hierarchy of ETRs and how aggregation of EID
	  prefixes from lower-level ETRs can be performed at a higher-level ETR. The various scenarios here are well illustrated and
	  described. This seems like a good idea, and a solution like
	  LISP can support this as specified. As any optimization scheme
	  would inevitably add some complexity; the proposed scheme for
	  enhancing mapping efficiency comes with some of its own
	  overhead. The gain depends on the details of specific EID
	  blocks, i.e., how frequently the situations (such as an
	  ETR that has a bigger EID block with a few holes) arise.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Rebuttal'>
	<t>
	  There are two main points in the critique that are addressed
	  here: (1) The gain depends on the details of specific EID blocks,
	  i.e., how frequently the situations arise such as an ETR having a
	  bigger EID block with a few holes, and (2) Approach 2 is lacking
	  an added feature of conveying just the mask-length of the more
	  specifics that exist as part of the current map response.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Regarding comment (1) above, there are multiple possibilities
	  regarding how situations can arise, resulting in allocations
	  having holes in them.  An example of one of these possibilities
	  is as follows. Org-A has historically received multiple /20s,
	  /22s, and /24s over the course of time that are adjacent to each
	  other. At the present time, these prefixes would all aggregate to
	  a /16 but for the fact that just a few of the underlying /24s
	  have been allocated elsewhere historically to other organizations
	  by an RIR or ISPs.  An example of a second possibility is that
	  Org-A has an allocation of a /16. It has suballocated a /22 to
	  one of its subsidiaries, and subsequently sold the subsidiary to
	  another Org-B. For ease of keeping the /22 subnet up and running
	  without service disruption, the /22 subprefix is allowed to be
	  transferred in the acquisition process.  Now the /22 subprefix
	  originates from a different AS and is serviced by a different ETR
	  (as compared to the parent \16 prefix).  We are in the process of
	  performing an analysis of RIR allocation data and are aware of
	  other studies (notably at UCLA) that are also performing similar
	  analysis to quantify the frequency of occurrence of the holes. We
	  feel that the problem that has been addressed is a realistic one,
	  and the proposed scheme would help reduce the overheads
	  associated with the mapping distribution system.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Regarding comment (2) above, the suggested modification to
	  Approach 2 would be definitely beneficial. In fact, we feel that
	  it would be fairly straightforward to dynamically use Approach 1
	  or Approach 2 (with the suggested modification), depending on
	  whether there are only a few (e.g., &lt;=5) or many (e.g., >5)
	  more specifics, respectively. The suggested modification of
	  notifying the mask-length of the more specifics in the map response
	  is indeed very helpful because then the ITR would not have to
	  resend a map-query for EID addresses that match the EID address
	  in the previous query up to at least mask-length bit
	  positions. There can be a two-bit field in the map response that
	  would be interpreted as follows.

<list style="format (%c)">
<t>value 00: there are no more specifics</t>
<t>value 01: there are more specifics and their exact information follows in additional
	  map-responses</t>
<t>value 10: there are more-specifics and the mask-length of the next more-specific is
	  indicated in the current map-response.</t>
</list>

 An additional field will
	  be included that will be used to specify the mask-length of the
	  next more-specific in the case of value 10 (case (c)
	  above).

	<t>
	  As the Internet continues its rapid growth, router memory size and
	  CPU cycle requirements are outpacing feasible hardware upgrade
	  schedules. We propose to solve this problem by applying aggregation
	  with increasing scopes to gradually evolve the routing system
	  towards a scalable structure. At each evolutionary step, our
	  solution is able to interoperate with the existing system and
	  provide immediate benefits to adopters to enable deployment. This
	  document summarizes the need for an evolutionary design, the
	  relationship between our proposal and other revolutionary proposals,
	  and the steps of aggregation with increasing scopes. Our detailed
	  proposal can be found in <xref target='Evolution' />.
	</t>
	<section title='Need for Evolution'>
	  <t>
	    Multiple different views exist regarding the routing scalability
	    problem.  Networks differ vastly in goals, behavior, and
	    resources, giving each a different view of the severity and
	    imminence of the scalability problem. Therefore, we believe that,
	    for any solution to be adopted, it will start with one or a few
	    early adopters and may not ever reach the entire Internet. The
	    evolutionary approach recognizes that changes to the Internet can
	    only be a gradual process with multiple stages. At each stage,
	    adopters are driven by and rewarded with solving an immediate
	    problem. Each solution must be deployable by individual networks
	    who deem it necessary at a time they deem it necessary, without
	    requiring coordination from other networks, and the solution has
	    to bring immediate relief to a single first-mover.
	  </t>
	</section>
	<section title='Relation to Other RRG Proposals'>
	  <t>
	    Most proposals take a revolutionary approach that expects the
	    entire Internet to eventually move to some new design whose
	    main benefits would not materialize until the vast majority of
	    the system has been upgraded; their incremental deployment plan
	    simply ensures interoperation between upgraded and legacy parts
	    of the system. In contrast, the evolutionary approach
	    depicts a system where changes may happen here and there as needed, but
	    there is no dependency on the system as a whole making a
	    change. Whoever takes a step forward gains the benefit by
	    solving his own problem, without depending on others to take
	    actions.  Thus, deployability includes not only
	    interoperability, but also the alignment of costs and gains.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The main differences between our approach and more revolutionary
	    map-and-encap proposals are: (a) we do not start with a pre-defined
	    boundary between edge and core; and (b) each step brings
	    immediate benefits to individual first-movers. Note that our
	    proposal neither interferes nor prevents any revolutionary
	    host-based solutions such as ILNP from being rolled out. However,
	    host-based solutions do not bring useful impact until a large
	    portion of hosts have been upgraded. Thus, even if a host-based
	    solution is rolled out in the long run, an evolutionary solution
	    is still needed for the near term.

	<section title='Aggregation with Increasing Scopes'>
	  <t>
	    Aggregating many routing entries to a fewer number is a basic
	    approach to improving routing scalability. Aggregation can take
	    different forms and be done within different scopes. In our
	    design, the aggregation scope starts from a single router, then
	    expands to a single network and neighbor networks. The order
	    of the following steps is not fixed but is merely a suggestion;
	    it is under each individual network's discretion which steps
	    they choose to take based on their evaluation of the severity
	    of the problems and the affordability of the solutions.
	    <list style='numbers'>
	      <t>
		FIB Aggregation (FA) in a single router. A router
		algorithmically aggregates its FIB entries without changing
		its RIB or its routing announcements. No coordination among
		routers is needed, nor any change to existing protocols. This
		brings scalability relief to individual routers with only a
		software upgrade.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Enabling 'best external' on Provider Edge routers
		(PEs), Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBRs), and
		Route Reflectors (RRs), and turning
		on next-hop-self on RRs.  For hierarchical networks, the RRs
		in each Point of Presence (PoP) can serve as a default gateway for nodes in the
		PoP, thus allowing the non-RR nodes in each PoP to maintain
		smaller routing tables that only include paths that egress
		that PoP. This is known as 'topology-based mode'
		Virtual Aggregation, and can be done with existing hardware
		and configuration changes only. Please see
		<xref target='Evolution_Grow_Presentation'/> for details.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Virtual Aggregation (VA) in a single network. Within an AS,
		some fraction of existing routers are designated as
		Aggregation Point Routers (APRs). These routers are either
		individually or collectively maintain the full FIB
		table. Other routers may suppress entries from their FIBs,
		instead forwarding packets to APRs, which will then tunnel
		the packets to the correct egress routers. VA can be viewed
		as an intra-domain map-and-encap system to provide the
		operators with a control mechanism for the FIB size in their
		routers.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		VA across neighbor networks. When adjacent networks have VA
		deployed, they can go one step further by piggybacking egress
		router information on existing BGP announcements, so that
		packets can be tunneled directly to a neighbor network's
		egress router. This improves packet delivery performance by
		performing the encapsulation/decapsulation only once across
		these neighbor networks, as well as reducing the stretch of
		the path.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Reducing RIB Size by separating the control plane from the
		data plane. Although a router's FIB can be reduced by FA or
		VA, it usually still needs to maintain the full RIB to
		produce complete routing announcements to its neighbors. To
		reduce the RIB size, a network can set up special boxes,
		which we call controllers, to take over the External BGP (eBGP) sessions
		from border routers.  The controllers receive eBGP
		announcements, make routing decisions, and then inform
		other routers in the same network of how to forward
		packets, while the regular routers just focus on the job of
		forwarding packets. The controllers, not being part of the
		data path, can be scaled using commodity hardware.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Insulating forwarding routers from routing churn. For
		routers with a smaller RIB, the rate of routing churn is
		naturally reduced. Further reduction can be achieved by not
		announcing failures of customer prefixes into the core, but
		handling these failures in a data-driven fashion, e.g., a
		link failure to an edge network is not reported unless and
		until there are data packets that are heading towards the
		failed link.

      <section title='Critique'>
	<t>
	  All of the RRG proposals that scale the routing architecture
	  share one fundamental approach, route aggregation, in different
	  forms, e.g., LISP removes "edge prefixes" using encapsulation at
	  ITRs, and ILNP achieves the goal by locator rewrite. In this
	  evolutionary path proposal, each stage of the evolution applies
	  aggregation with increasing scopes to solve a specific
	  scalability problem, and eventually the path leads towards global
	  routing scalability. For example, it uses FIB aggregation at the
	  single router level, virtual aggregation at the network level,
	  and then between neighboring networks at the inter-domain level.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Compared to other proposals, this proposal has the lowest hurdle
	  to deployment, because it does not require that all networks move
	  to use a global mapping system or upgrade all hosts, and it is
	  designed for each individual network to get immediate benefits
	  after its own deployment.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Criticisms of this proposal fall into two types.  The first type
	  concerns several potential issues in the technical design as
	  listed below:
	  <list style='numbers'>
	    <t>
	      FIB aggregation, at level-3 and level-4, may introduce extra
	      routable space.  Concerns have been raised about the
	      potential routing loops resulting from forwarding otherwise
	      non-routable packets, and the potential impact on
	      Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF)
	      checking.  These concerns can be addressed by choosing a
	      lower level of aggregation and by adding null routes to
	      minimize the extra space, at the cost of reduced aggregation
	      gain.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      Virtual Aggregation changes the traffic paths in an ISP
	      network, thereby introducing stretch. Changing the traffic
	      path may also impact the reverse path checking practice used
	      to filter out packets from spoofed sources.  More analysis is
	      need to identify the potential side-effects of VA and to
	      address these issues.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      The current Virtual Aggregation description is difficult to
	      understand, due to its multiple options for encapsulation and
	      popular prefix configurations, which makes the mechanism look
	      overly complicated. More thought is needed to simplify the
	      design and description.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      FIB Aggregation and Virtual Aggregation may require
	      additional operational cost.  There may be new design
	      trade-offs that the operators need to understand in order to
	      select the best option for their networks. More analysis is
	      needed to identify and quantify all potential operational
	      costs.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      In contrast to a number of other proposals, this solution
	      does not provide mobility support. It remains an open
	      question as to whether the routing system should handle
	      mobility.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>

	<t>
	  The second criticism is whether deploying quick fixes like FIB
	  aggregation would alleviate scalability problems in the short
	  term and reduce the incentives for deploying a new architecture;
	  and whether an evolutionary approach would end up with adding
	  more and more patches to the old architecture, and not lead to a
	  fundamentally new architecture as the proposal had expected.
	  Though this solution may get rolled out more easily and quickly,
	  a new architecture, if/once deployed, could solve more problems
	  with cleaner solutions.

    <section title='Name-Based Sockets'>
      <section title='Summary'>
	<t>
	  Name-based sockets are an evolution of the existing address-based
	  sockets, enabling applications to initiate and receive
	  communication sessions based on the use of domain names in lieu
	  of IP addresses.  Name-based sockets move the existing
	  indirection from domain names to IP addresses from its current
	  position in applications down to the IP layer.  As a result,
	  applications communicate exclusively based on domain names, while
	  the discovery, selection, and potentially in-session re-selection
	  of IP addresses is centrally performed by the IP stack itself.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Name-based sockets help mitigate the Internet routing scalability
	  problem by separating naming and addressing more consistently
	  than what is possible with the existing address-based sockets.
	  This supports IP address aggregation because it simplifies the
	  use of IP addresses with high topological significance, as well
	  as the dynamic replacement of IP addresses during
	  network-topological and host-attachment changes.
	</t>
	<t>
	  A particularly positive effect of name-based sockets on Internet
	  routing scalability is the new incentives for edge network
	  operators to use provider-assigned IP addresses, which are more
	  aggregatable than the typically preferred provider-independent IP
	  addresses.  Even though provider-independent IP addresses are
	  harder to get and more expensive than provider-assigned IP
	  addresses, many operators desire provider-independent addresses
	  due to the high indirect cost of provider-assigned IP addresses.
	  This indirect cost is comprised of both difficulties in
	  multihoming, and tedious and largely manual renumbering upon
	  provider changes.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Name-based sockets reduce the indirect cost of provider-assigned
	  IP addresses in three ways, and hence make the use of
	  provider-assigned IP addresses more acceptable: (1) They enable
	  fine-grained and responsive multihoming.  (2) They simplify
	  renumbering by offering an easy means to replace IP addresses in
	  referrals with domain names.  This helps avoiding updates to
	  application and operating system configurations, scripts, and
	  databases during renumbering.  (3) They facilitate low-cost
	  solutions that eliminate renumbering altogether.  One such
	  low-cost solution is IP address translation, which in combination
	  with name-based sockets loses its adverse impact on applications.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The prerequisite for a positive effect of name-based sockets on
	  Internet routing scalability is their adoption in operating
	  systems and applications.  Operating systems should be augmented
	  to offer name-based sockets as a new alternative to the existing
	  address-based sockets, and applications should use name-based
	  sockets for their communications.  Neither an instantaneous, nor
	  an eventually complete transition to name-based sockets is
	  required, yet the positive effect on Internet routing scalability
	  will grow with the extent of this transition.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Name-based sockets were hence designed with a focus on deployment
	  incentives, comprising both immediate deployment benefits as well
	  as low deployment costs.  Name-based sockets provide a benefit to
	  application developers because the alleviation of applications
	  from IP address management responsibilities simplifies and
	  expedites application development.  This benefit is immediate
	  owing to the backwards compatibility of name-based sockets with
	  legacy applications and legacy peers.  The appeal to application
	  developers, in turn, is an immediate benefit for operating system
	  vendors who adopt name-based sockets.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Name-based sockets furthermore minimize deployment costs:
	  Alternative techniques to separate naming and addressing provide
	  applications with "surrogate IP addresses" that dynamically map
	  onto regular IP addresses.  A surrogate IP address is
	  indistinguishable from a regular IP address for applications, but
	  does not have the topological significance of a regular IP
	  address.  Mobile IP and the Host Identity Protocol are examples
	  of such separation techniques.  Mobile IP uses "home IP
	  addresses" as surrogate IP addresses with reduced topological
	  significance.  The Host Identity Protocol uses "host identifiers"
	  as surrogate IP addresses without topological significance.  A
	  disadvantage of surrogate IP addresses is their incurred cost in
	  terms of extra administrative overhead and, for some techniques,
	  extra infrastructure.  Since surrogate IP addresses must be
	  resolvable to the corresponding regular IP addresses, they must
	  be provisioned in the DNS or similar infrastructure.  Mobile IP
	  uses a new infrastructure of home agents for this purpose, while
	  the Host Identity Protocol populates DNS servers with host
	  identities.  Name-based sockets avoid this cost because they
	  function without surrogate IP addresses, and hence without the
	  provisioning and infrastructure requirements that accompany
	  surrogate addresses.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Certainly, some edge networks will continue to use
	  provider-independent addresses despite name-based sockets,
	  perhaps simply due to inertia. But name-based sockets will help
	  reduce the number of those networks, and thus have a positive
	  impact on Internet routing scalability.

      <section title='Critique'>
	<t>
	  Name-based sockets contribution to the routing scalability
	  problem is to decrease the reliance on PI addresses, allowing a
	  greater use of PA addresses, and thus a less fragmented routing
	  table. It provides end hosts with an API which makes the
	  applications address-agnostic. The name abstraction allows the
	  hosts to use any type of locator, independent of format or
	  provider. This increases the motivation and usability of PA
	  addresses. Some applications, in particular bootstrapping
	  applications, may still require hard coded IP addresses, and as
	  such will still motivate the use of PI addresses.
	</t>
	<section title='Deployment'>
	  <t>
	    The main incentives and drivers are geared towards the
	    transition of applications to the name-based sockets. Adoption
	    by applications will be driven by benefits in terms of reduced
	    application development cost. Legacy applications are expected
	    to migrate to the new API at a slower pace, as the name-based
	    sockets are backwards compatible, this can happen in a per-host
	    fashion. Also, not all applications can be ported to a FQDN
	    dependent infrastructure, e.g., DNS functions. This hurdle is
	    manageable, and may not be a definite obstacle for the
	    transition of a whole domain, but it needs to be taken into
	    account when striving for mobility/multihoming of an entire
	    site. The transition of functions on individual hosts may be
	    trivial, either through upgrades/changes to the OS or as linked
	    libraries. This can still happen incrementally and
	    independently, as compatibility is not affected by the use of
	    name-based sockets.
	  </t>
	</section>
	<section title='Edge-networks'>
	  <t>
	    Name-based sockets rely on the transition of individual
	    applications and are backwards compatible, so they do not
	    require bilateral upgrades. This allows each host to migrate
	    its applications independently. Name-based sockets may make an
	    individual client agnostic to the networking medium, be it
	    PA/PI IP-addresses or in a the future an entirely different
	    networking medium. However, an entire edge-network, with
	    internal and external services will not be able to make a
	    complete transition in the near future. Hence, even if a
	    substantial fraction of the hosts in an edge-network use
	    name-based sockets, PI addresses may still be required by the
	    edge-network. In short, new services may be implemented using
	    name-based sockets, old services may be ported. Name-based
	    sockets provide an increased motivation to move to PA-addresses
	    as actual provider independence relies less and less on
	    PI-addressing.

      <section title='Summary'>
	<t>
	  RANGER is a locator/identifier separation approach that uses
	  IP-in-IP encapsulation to connect edge networks across transit
	  networks such as the global Internet. End systems use endpoint
	  interface identifier (EID) addresses that may be routable within
	  edge networks but do not appear in transit network routing
	  tables. EID to Routing Locator (RLOC) address bindings are
	  instead maintained in mapping tables and also cached in default
	  router FIBs (i.e., very much the same as for the global DNS and
	  its associated caching resolvers). RANGER enterprise networks are
	  organized in a recursive hierarchy with default mappers
	  connecting lower layers to the next higher layer in the
	  hierarchy.  Default mappers forward initial packets and push
	  mapping information to lower-tier routers and end systems through
	  secure redirection.

	  The RANGER architectural framework is intended to be applicable
	  for a Core-Edge Separation (CES) architecture for scalable
	  routing, using either IPv4 or IPv6 -- or using both in an
	  integrated system which may carry one protocol over the other.
	</t>
	<t>
	  However, despite <xref target="IRON"/> being readied for
	  publication as an experimental RFC, the framework falls well
	  short of the level of detail required to envisage how it could be
	  used to implement a practical scalable routing solution.  For
	  instance, the document contains no specification for a mapping
	  protocol, or how the mapping lookup system would work on a global
	  scale.
	</t>
	<t>
	  There is no provision for RANGER's ITR-like routers being able
	  to probe the reachability of end-user networks via multiple
	  ETR-like routers -- nor for any other approach to multihoming
	  service restoration.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Nor is there any provision for inbound TE or support of mobile
	  devices which frequently change their point of attachment.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Therefore, in its current form, RANGER cannot be contemplated as
	  a superior scalable routing solution to some other proposals
	  which are specified in sufficient detail and which appear to be
	  feasible.
	</t>
	<t>
	  RANGER uses its own tunneling and PMTUD management protocol:
	  SEAL.  Adoption of SEAL in its current form would prevent the
	  proper utilization of jumbo frame paths in the DFZ, which will
	  become the norm in the future.  SEAL uses "Packet Too Big"
	  <xref target='RFC4443'/> and "Fragmentation Needed"
	  <xref target='RFC0792'/> messages to the sending host only to fix
	  a preset maximum packet length.  To avoid the need for the SEAL
	  layer to fragment packets of this length, this MTU value (for the
	  input of the tunnel) needs to be set significantly below 1500
	  bytes, assuming the typically ~1500 byte MTU values for paths
	  across the DFZ today.  In order to avoid this excessive
	  fragmentation, this value could only be raised to a ~9k byte
	  value at some time in the future where essentially all paths
	  between ITRs and ETRs were jumbo frame capable.

	<t>
	  The Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) <xref target='IRON'/>
	  is a scalable Internet routing architecture that builds on the
	  RANGER recursive enterprise network hierarchy
	  <xref target='RFC5720'/>. IRON bonds together participating
	  RANGER networks using VET <xref target='VET'/> and SEAL
	  <xref target='SEAL'/> to enable secure and scalable routing
	  through automatic tunneling within the Internet core.  The
	  IRON-RANGER automatic tunneling abstraction views the entire
	  global Internet DFZ as a virtual Non-Broadcast Multi-Access
	  (NBMA) link similar to ISATAP <xref target='RFC5214'/>.
	</t>
	<t>
	  IRON-RANGER is an example of a Core-Edge Separation (CES)
	  system. Instead of a classical mapping database, however,
	  IRON-RANGER uses a hybrid combination of a proactive dynamic
	  routing protocol for distributing highly aggregated Virtual
	  Prefixes (VPs) and an on-demand data driven protocol for
	  distributing more-specific Provider-Independent (PI) prefixes
	  derived from the VPs.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The IRON-RANGER hierarchy consists of recursively-nested
	  RANGER enterprise networks joined together by IRON routers
	  that participate in a global BGP instance. The IRON BGP
	  instance is maintained separately from the current Internet
	  BGP Routing LOCator (RLOC) address space (i.e., the set of
	  all public IPv4 prefixes in the Internet). Instead, the IRON
	  BGP instance maintains VPs taken from Endpoint Interface
	  iDentifier (EID) address space, e.g., the IPv6 global unicast
	  address space. To accommodate scaling, only O(10k) -- O(100k)
	  VPs are allocated e.g., using /20 or shorter IPv6 prefixes.
	</t>
	<t>
	  IRON routers lease portions of their VPs as Provider-Independent
	  (PI) prefixes for customer equipment (CEs), thereby creating a
	  sustainable business model. CEs that lease PI prefixes propagate
	  address mapping(s) throughout their attached RANGER networks and
	  up to VP-owning IRON router(s) through periodic transmission of
	  "bubbles" with authentication and PI prefix information. Routers
	  in RANGER networks and IRON routers that receive and forward the
	  bubbles securely install PI prefixes in their FIBs, but do not
	  inject them into the RIB.  IRON routers therefore keep track of
	  only their customer base via the FIB entries and keep track of
	  only the Internet-wide VP database in the RIB.
	</t>
	<t>
	  IRON routers propagate more-specific prefixes using secure
	  redirection to update router FIBs. Prefix redirection is
	  driven by the data plane and does not affect the control
	  plane. Redirected prefixes are not injected into the RIB,
	  but rather are maintained as FIB soft state that is purged
	  after expiration or route failure. Neighbor unreachability
	  detection is used to detect failure.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Secure prefix registrations and redirections are accommodated
	  through the mechanisms of SEAL. Tunnel endpoints using SEAL
	  synchronize sequence numbers, and can therefore discard any
	  packets they receive that are outside of the current sequence
	  number window. Hence, off-path attacks are defeated. These
	  synchronized tunnel endpoints can therefore exchange prefixes
	  with signed certificates that prove prefix ownership in such
	  a way that DoS vectors that attack crypto calculation overhead
	  are eliminated due to the prevention of off-path attacks.
	</t>
	<t>
	  CEs can move from old RANGER networks and re-inject their PI
	  prefixes into new RANGER networks. This would be accommodated by
	  IRON-RANGER as a site multihoming event while host mobility and
	  true locator-ID separation is accommodated via HIP
	  <xref target='RFC5201'/>.

    <section title="Recommendation">
      <t>
	As can be seen from the extensive list of proposals above, the
	group explored a number of possible solutions. Unfortunately, the
	group did not reach rough consensus on a single best approach.
	Accordingly, the recommendation has been left to the co-chairs.
	The remainder of this section describes the rationale and decision
	of the co-chairs.
      </t>
      <t>
	As a reminder, the goal of the research group was to develop a
	recommendation for an approach to a routing and addressing
	architecture for the Internet.  The primary goal of the
	architecture is to provide improved scalability for the routing
	subsystem.  Specifically, this implies that we should be able to
	continue to grow the routing subsystem to meet the needs of the
	Internet without requiring drastic and continuous increases in the
	amount of state or processing requirements for routers.
      </t>
      <section title='Motivation'>
	<t>
	  There is a general concern that the cost and structure of the
	  routing and addressing architecture as we know it today may
	  become prohibitively expensive with continued growth, with
	  repercussions to the health of the Internet. As such, there is an
	  urgent need to examine and evaluate potential scalability
	  enhancements.
	</t>
	<t>
	  For the long term future of the Internet, it has become apparent
	  that IPv6 is going to play a significant role.  It has taken more
	  than a decade, but IPv6 is starting to see some non-trivial
	  amount of deployment.  This is in part due to the depletion of
	  IPv4 addresses.  It therefore seems apparent that the new
	  architecture must be applicable to IPv6.  It may or may not be
	  applicable to IPv4, but not addressing the IPv6 portion of the
	  network would simply lead to recreating the routing scalability
	  problem in the IPv6 domain, because the two share a common
	  routing architecture.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Whatever change we make, we should expect that this is a very
	  long-lived change.  The routing architecture of the entire
	  Internet is a loosely coordinated, complex, expensive subsystem,
	  and permanent, pervasive changes to it will require difficult
	  choices during deployment and integration.  These cannot be
	  undertaken lightly.
	</t>
	<t>
	  By extension, if we are going to the trouble, pain, and expense
	  of making major architectural changes, it follows that we want to
	  make the best changes possible.  We should regard any such
	  changes as permanent and we should therefore aim for long term
	  solutions that place the network in the best possible position
	  for ongoing growth.  These changes should be cleanly integrated,
	  first-class citizens within the architecture.  That is to say
	  that any new elements that are integrated into the architecture
	  should be fundamental primitives, on par with the other existing
	  legacy primitives in the architecture, that interact naturally
	  and logically when in combination with other elements of the
	  architecture.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Over the history of the Internet, we have been very good about
	  creating temporary, ad-hoc changes, both to the routing
	  architecture and other aspects of the network layer.  However,
	  many of these band-aid solutions have come with a significant
	  overhead in terms of long-term maintenance and architectural
	  complexity.  This is to be avoided and short-term improvements
	  should eventually be replaced by long-term, permanent solutions.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In the particular instance of the routing and addressing
	  architecture today, we feel that the situation requires that we
	  pursue both short-term improvements and long-term solutions.
	  These are not incompatible because we truly intend for the
	  short-term improvements to be completely localized and temporary.
	  The short-term improvements are necessary to give us the time
	  necessary to develop, test, and deploy the long-term solution.
	  As the long-term solution is rolled out and gains traction, the
	  short-term improvements should be of less benefit and can
	  subsequently be withdrawn.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor='recommendation' title='Recommendation to the IETF'>
	<t>
	  The group explored a number of proposed solutions but did not reach
	  consensus on a single best approach.  Therefore, in fulfillment
	  of the routing research group's charter, the co-chairs recommend
	  that the IETF pursue work in the following areas:	  
	  <list>
	    <t>
	      Evolution
	      <xref target='Evolution'/> 
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP)
	      <xref target='ILNP_Site'/> 
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Renumbering <xref target='RFC5887'/>
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Rationale'>
	<t>
	  We selected Evolution because it is a short-term improvement.  It
	  can be applied on a per-domain basis, under local administration
	  and has immediate effect.  While there is some complexity
	  involved, we feel that this option is constructive for service
	  providers who find the additional complexity to be less painful
	  than upgrading hardware.  This improvement can be deployed by
	  domains that feel it necessary, for as long as they feel it is
	  necessary.  If this deployment lasts longer than expected, then
	  the implications of that decision are wholly local to the domain.
	</t>
	<t>
	  We recommended ILNP because we find it to be a clean solution for
	  the architecture.  It separates location from identity in a
	  clear, straightforward way that is consistent with the remainder
	  of the Internet architecture and makes both first-class
	  citizens.  Unlike the many map-and-encap proposals, there are no
	  complications due to tunneling, indirection, or semantics that
	  shift over the lifetime of a packet's delivery.
	</t>
	<t>
	  We recommend further work on automating renumbering because even
	  with ILNP, the ability of a domain to change its locators at
	  minimal cost is fundamentally necessary.  No routing architecture
	  will be able to scale without some form of abstraction, and
	  domains that change their point of attachment must fundamentally
	  be prepared to change their locators in line with this
	  abstraction.  We recognize that
	  <xref target='RFC5887'/> is not a solution
	  so much as a problem statement, and we are simply recommending
	  that the IETF create effective and convenient mechanisms for site
	  renumbering.

	      There has been much discussion over the last years about the

	      This draft describes a network-based protocol that enables
	      separation of IP addresses into two new numbering spaces:
	      Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and Routing Locators (RLOCs).  No
	      changes are required to either host protocol stacks or to the
	      "core" of the Internet infrastructure.  LISP can be
	      incrementally deployed, without a "flag day", and offers

	      to early adopters, when there are relatively few LISP-

	  <abstract>
	    <t>
	      This document describes techniques for allowing sites running
	      the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) to interoperate
	      with Internet sites (which may be using either IPv4, IPv6, or
	      both) but which are not running LISP.  A fundamental property
	      of LISP speaking sites is that they use Endpoint Identifiers
	      (EIDs), rather than traditional IP addresses, in the source
	      and destination fields of all traffic they emit or receive.
	      While EIDs are syntactically identical to IPv4 or IPv6
	      addresses, normally routes to them are not carried in the
	      global routing system so an interoperability mechanism is
	      needed for non- LISP-speaking sites to exchange traffic with
	      LISP-speaking sites. This document introduces three such
	      mechanisms.  The first uses a new network element, the LISP
	      Proxy Ingress Tunnel Routers (PITR) (Section 5) to act as a
	      intermediate LISP Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR) for
	      non-LISP-speaking hosts.  Second the document adds Network
	      Address Translation (NAT) functionality to LISP Ingress and
	      LISP Egress Tunnel Routers (xTRs) to substitute routable IP
	      addresses for non-routable EIDs.  Finally, this document
	      introduces a Proxy Egress Tunnel Router (PETR) to handle
	      cases where a LISP ITR cannot send packets to non-LISP sites
	      without encapsulation.

	    <t>
	      Recent work on Locator/ID Separation has focused primarily on
	      the control plane protocols concerned with finding
	      Identifier-to-Locator mappings. However, experience gained
	      with a trial deployment of a system designed to implement
	      Locator/ID Separation has revealed two general classes of
	      problems which must be resolved after the mapping is found:
	      The Locator Path Liveness Problem and the State
	      Synchronization Problem.  These problems have implications
	      for the data plane as well as the control plane.

	  <abstract>
	    <t>
	      This document describes a framework how the current IPv4
	      address space can be divided in two new address categories; a
	      core address space (Area Locators, ALOC) that is globally
	      unique and an edge address space (Endpoint Locators, ELOC)
	      that is regionally unique - in the future the ELOC space is
	      only significant in a private network or in a service
	      provider domain, therefore a 32 x 32 bit addressing scheme
	      and a hierarchical routing architecture is achieved. The
	      hierarchical IPv4 framework is backwards compatible with the
	      current IPv4 Internet; it also discusses a method to decouple
	      the location and identifier functions, future applications
	      can make use of the separation. The framework requires
	      extensions to the existing Domain Name System, the existing
	      IPv4 stack of the endpoints, middleboxes and to routers in
	      the Internet. The framework can be implemented incrementally
	      to endpoints, DNS, middleboxes and routers.

	  <abstract>
	    <t>
	      Often endpoints are connected by multiple paths, but the
	      nature of TCP/IP restricts communications to a single path
	      per socket. Resource usage within the network would be more
	      efficient were these multiple paths able to be used
	      concurrently.  This should enhance user experience through
	      improved resilience to network failure and higher throughput.
	      This document outlines architectural guidelines for the
	      development of a Multipath Transport Protocol, with
	      references to how these architectural components come
	      together in the Multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocol.  This
	      document also lists certain high level design decisions that
	      provide foundations for the MPTCP design, based upon these
	      architectural requirements.

	    <t>
	      The purpose of a referral is to enable a given entity in a
	      multiparty application to pass information to another party.
	      This memo specifies a Generic Referral Object (GRO) to be
	      used in the context of referrals.  The proposed object is
	      compact and is application- independent.  Both IPv4 and IPv6
	      schemes are supported, as well as upper layer identifiers.
	      Additional information to characterise an enclosed reference
	      is also described.  To allow proper interpretation of
	      referrals, a new notion of scope identifiers is introduced.

	  <abstract>
	    <t>
	      Internet routing scalability has long been considered a
	      serious problem.  Although many efforts have been devoted to
	      address this problem over the years, the IETF community as a
	      whole is yet to achieve a shared understanding on what is the
	      best way forward.  In this draft, we step up a level to
	      re-examine the problem and the ongoing efforts. we conclude
	      that, to effectively solve the routing scalability problem,
	      we first need a clear understanding on how to introduce
	      solutions to the Internet which is a global scale deployed
	      system.  In this draft we sketch out our reasoning on the
	      need for an evolutionary path towards scaling the global
	      routing system, instead of attempting to introduce a brand
	      new design.

	      Since the Internet must continue to support escalating growth
	      due to increasing demand, it is clear that current routing
	      architectures and operational practices must be updated.
	      This document proposes an Internet Routing Overlay Network
	      (IRON) that supports sustainable growth while requiring no
	      changes to end systems and no changes to the existing routing
	      system.  IRON further addresses other important issues
	      including routing scaling, mobility management, multihoming,
	      traffic engineering and NAT traversal.  While business
	      considerations are an important determining factor for
	      widespread adoption, they are out of scope for this document.

	      Routing and Addressing in Networks with Global Enterprise
	      Recursion (RANGER) [RFC5720] provides an architectural
	      framework for scalable routing and addressing.  It provides
	      an incrementally deployable approach for scalability,
	      provider independence, mobility, multihoming, traffic
	      engineering and security.  This document describes a series
	      of use cases in order to showcase the architectural
	      capabilities.  It further shows how the RANGER architecture
	      restores the network-within-network principles originally
	      intended for the sustained growth of the Internet.

	      Enterprise networks connect hosts and routers over various
	      link types, and often also connect to provider networks
	      and/or the global Internet.  Enterprise network nodes require

	      For the purpose of this document, a subnetwork is defined as
	      a virtual topology configured over a connected IP network
	      routing region and bounded by encapsulating border nodes.
	      These virtual topologies are manifested by tunnels that may
	      span multiple IP and/or sub-IP layer forwarding hops, and can
	      introduce failure modes due to packet duplication and/or
	      links with diverse Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs).  This
	      document specifies a Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation
	      Layer (SEAL) that accommodates such virtual topologies over
