         <t>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) permits a person, role, or
            organization that owns the signing domain to claim some
            responsibility for a message by associating the domain with the

            of the Signer of the message from the purported author of the

            cryptographic signature and by querying the Signer's domain directly to
            retrieve the appropriate public key. Message transit from author to

      <section
         title="Introduction">

         <t>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) permits a person, role, or
            organization to claim some responsibility for a message by
            associating a domain name <xref
               target="RFC1034" /> with the message <xref
               target="RFC5322" />, which they are authorized to use. This can
            be an author's organization, an operational relay, or one of their
            agents. Assertion of responsibility is validated through a
            cryptographic signature and by querying the Signer's domain directly to
            retrieve the appropriate public key. Message transit from author to
            recipient is through relays that typically make no substantive
            change to the message content and thus preserve the DKIM signature.
            A message can contain multiple signatures, from the same or
            different organizations involved with the message. </t>

         <t>The approach taken by DKIM differs from previous approaches to
            message signing (e.g., Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
            (S/MIME) <xref
               target="RFC5751" />, OpenPGP <xref
               target="RFC4880" />) in that: <list
               style="symbols">
               <t>the message signature is written as a message header field so
                  that neither human recipients nor existing MUA (Mail User
                  Agent) software is confused by signature-related content
                  appearing in the message body;</t>
               <t>there is no dependency on public- and private-key pairs being
                  issued by well-known, trusted certificate authorities; </t>
               <t>there is no dependency on the deployment of any new Internet
                  protocols or services for public-key distribution or
                  revocation;</t>
               <t>signature verification failure does not force rejection of the
                  message;</t>
               <t>no attempt is made to include encryption as part of the
                  mechanism; and</t>
               <t>message archiving is not a design goal.</t>
            </list></t>

         <t>DKIM: <list
               style="symbols">
               <t>is compatible with the existing email infrastructure and
                  transparent to the fullest extent possible;</t>
               <t>requires minimal new infrastructure;</t>
               <t>can be implemented independently of clients in order to reduce
                  deployment time;</t>
               <t>can be deployed incrementally; and</t>

		<t> Readers are advised to be familiar with the material in
			<xref target="RFC4686"/>, <xref target="RFC5585"/>,

         <section
            title="Signing Identity">

            <t>DKIM separates the question of the identity of the Signer of the
               message from the purported author of the message. In particular,
               a signature includes the identity of the Signer. Verifiers can
               use the signing information to decide how they want to process
               the message. The signing identity is included as part of the
               signature header field. <list>
                  <t>INFORMATIVE RATIONALE: The signing identity specified by a
                     DKIM signature is not required to match an address in any
                     particular header field because of the broad methods of
                     interpretation by recipient mail systems, including
                     MUAs.</t>
               </list></t>
         </section>

         <section
            title="Scalability">

            <t>DKIM is designed to support the extreme scalability requirements
               that characterize the email identification problem. There are
               many millions of domains and a much larger number of
               individual addresses. DKIM seeks to preserve the positive aspects
               of the current email infrastructure, such as the ability for
               anyone to communicate with anyone else without introduction.</t>
         </section>

         <section
            title="Simple Key Management">

            <t>DKIM differs from traditional hierarchical public-key systems in
               that no certificate authority infrastructure is required; the
               Verifier requests the public key from a repository in the domain
               of the claimed Signer directly rather than from a third
               party.</t>

            <t>The DNS is proposed as the initial mechanism for the public keys.
               Thus, DKIM currently depends on DNS administration and the
               security of the DNS system. DKIM is designed to be extensible to
               other key fetching services as they become available.</t>

         </section>

         <section
            title="Data Integrity">

            <t>A DKIM signature associates the "d=" name with the computed hash of
               some or all of the message (see Section 3.7) in order to prevent
               the reuse of the signature with different messages. Verifying
               the signature asserts that the hashed content has not changed
               since it was signed and asserts nothing else about "protecting"
               the end-to-end integrity of the message.</t>

      <section
         title="Terminology and Definitions">

         <t>This section defines terms used in the rest of the document. </t>

         <t>DKIM is designed to operate within the Internet Mail service, as
            defined in <xref
               target="RFC5598" />. Basic email terminology is taken from that
            specification.</t>

         <t>Syntax descriptions use Augmented BNF (ABNF) <xref
               target="RFC5234" />. </t>
         <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
            "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
	    and "OPTIONAL" in this
            document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
               target="RFC2119" />.  These words take their normative meanings
		only when they are presented in ALL UPPERCASE. </t>



         <section
            title="Signers">

            <t>Elements in the mail system that sign messages on behalf of a
               domain are referred to as Signers. These may be MUAs (Mail User
               Agents), MSAs (Mail Submission Agents), MTAs (Mail Transfer
               Agents), or other agents such as mailing list exploders. In
               general, any Signer will be involved in the injection of a
               message into the message system in some way. The key issue is
               that a message must be signed before it leaves the administrative
               domain of the Signer.</t>
         </section>

         <section
            title="Verifiers">

            <t> Elements in the mail system that verify signatures are referred
               to as Verifiers. These may be MTAs, Mail Delivery Agents (MDAs),
               or MUAs. In most cases, it is expected that Verifiers will be
               close to an end user (reader) of the message or some consuming
               agent such as a mailing list exploder.</t>
         </section>








         <section
            title="Identity">
            <t>A person, role, or organization. In the context of DKIM, examples
               include the author, the author's organization, an ISP along the
               handling path, an independent trust assessment service, and a
               mailing list operator.</t>
         </section>

         <section
            title="Identifier">
            <t> A label that refers to an identity.</t>
         </section>

         <section
            title="Signing Domain Identifier (SDID)">
            <t>A single domain name that is the mandatory payload output of DKIM
               and that refers to the identity claiming some responsibility for
               the message by signing it.  It is specified in
	       <xref target="dkimsighead" />.</t>
         </section>

         <section
            title="Agent or User Identifier (AUID)">
            <t>A single identifier that refers to the agent or user on behalf of
               whom the Signing Domain Identifier (SDID) has taken
               responsibility. The AUID comprises a domain name and an optional
               &lt;local-part&gt;. The domain name is the same as that used for
               the SDID or is a subdomain of it. For DKIM processing, the
               domain name portion of the AUID has only basic domain name
               semantics; any possible owner-specific semantics are outside the
               scope of DKIM. It is specified in <xref
                  target="dkimsighead" />.</t>

	    <t>Note that acceptable values for the AUID may be constrained
               via a flag in the public-key record.  (See
	       <xref target="textrep"/>.) </t>
         </section>

         <section
            title="Identity Assessor">
            <t>An element in the mail system that consumes DKIM's payload,
	       which is the responsible Signing Domain Identifier (SDID). The
	       Identity Assessor is
               dedicated to the assessment of the delivered identifier. Other
               DKIM (and non-DKIM) values can also be used by the Identity
               Assessor (if they are available) to provide a more general
	       message evaluation filtering engine.
               However, this additional activity is outside the scope of
               this specification.</t>

                  <t>FWS is folding whitespace. It allows multiple lines

               (%x7F), SPACE (%x20), and semicolon (";", %x3B) MUST be encoded.
               Note that all whitespace, including SPACE, CR, and LF characters,
               MUST be encoded. After encoding, FWS MAY be added at arbitrary
               locations in order to avoid excessively long lines; such
               whitespace is NOT part of the value, and MUST be removed before
               decoding.  Use of characters not listed as "mail-safe" in
	       <xref target="RFC2049"/> is NOT RECOMMENDED.

      <section
         title="Protocol Elements">

         <t> Protocol Elements are conceptual parts of the protocol that are not
            specific to either Signers or Verifiers. The protocol descriptions
            for Signers and Verifiers are described in later sections ("Signer
            Actions" (<xref
               target="signer" />) and "Verifier Actions" (<xref
               target="verifier" />)). NOTE: This section must be read in the
            context of those sections.</t>

         <section
            anchor="selectors"
            title="Selectors">

            <t>To support multiple concurrent public keys per signing domain,
               the key namespace is subdivided using "selectors". For example,
               selectors might indicate the names of office locations (e.g.,
               "sanfrancisco", "coolumbeach", and "reykjavik"), the signing date
               (e.g., "january2005", "february2005", etc.), or even an
               individual user.</t>

            <t>Selectors are needed to support some important use cases. For
               example: <list
                  style="symbols">
                  <t>Domains that want to delegate signing capability for a
                     specific address for a given duration to a partner, such as
                     an advertising provider or other outsourced function.</t>
                  <t> Domains that want to allow frequent travelers to send
                     messages locally without the need to connect with a
                     particular MSA.</t>
                  <t>"Affinity" domains (e.g., college alumni associations) that
                     provide forwarding of incoming mail, but that do not
                     operate a mail submission agent for outgoing mail.</t>
               </list></t>

            <t> Periods are allowed in selectors and are component separators.
               When keys are retrieved from the DNS, periods in selectors define
               DNS label boundaries in a manner similar to the conventional use
               in domain names. Selector components might be used to combine
               dates with locations, for example, "march2005.reykjavik". In a
               DNS implementation, this can be used to allow delegation of a
               portion of the selector namespace.</t>

                     <figure>
                        <preamble>ABNF:</preamble>

selector =   sub-domain *( "." sub-domain )]]></artwork>
                     </figure>


            <t>The number of public keys and corresponding selectors for each
               domain is determined by the domain owner. Many domain owners will
               be satisfied with just one selector, whereas administratively
               distributed organizations can choose to manage disparate
               selectors and key pairs in different regions or on different
               email servers.</t>

            <t>Beyond administrative convenience, selectors make it possible to
               seamlessly replace public keys on a routine basis. If a domain
               wishes to change from using a public key associated with selector
               "january2005" to a public key associated with selector
               "february2005", it merely makes sure that both public keys are
               advertised in the public-key repository concurrently for the
               transition period during which email may be in transit prior to
               verification. At the start of the transition period, the outbound
               email servers are configured to sign with the "february2005"
               private key. At the end of the transition period, the
               "january2005" public key is removed from the public-key
               repository. <list>
                  <t>INFORMATIVE NOTE: A key may also be revoked as described
                     below. The distinction between revoking and removing a key
                     selector record is subtle. When phasing out keys as
                     described above, a signing domain would probably simply
                     remove the key record after the transition period. However,
                     a signing domain could elect to revoke the key (but
                     maintain the key record) for a further period. There is no
                     defined semantic difference between a revoked key and a
                     removed key.</t>
               </list></t>

            <t>While some domains may wish to make selector values well-known,
               others will want to take care not to allocate selector names in a
               way that allows harvesting of data by outside parties. For
               example, if per-user keys are issued, the domain owner will need
               to decide whether to associate this selector
               directly with the name of a registered end user or make it some
               unassociated random value, such as a fingerprint of the public
               key. <list>
                  <t>INFORMATIVE OPERATIONS NOTE: Reusing a selector with a new
                     key (for example, changing the key associated with a user's
                     name) makes it impossible to tell the difference between a
                     message that didn't verify because the key is no longer
                     valid and a message that is actually forged. For this
                     reason, Signers are ill-advised to reuse selectors for new
                     keys. A better strategy is to assign new keys to new
                     selectors.</t>

            <t>DKIM uses a simple "tag=value" syntax in several contexts,
               including in messages and domain signature records.</t>

            <t>Values are a series of strings containing either plain text,
               "base64" text (as defined in <xref
                  target="RFC2045" />, Section&nbsp;6.8), "qp-section" (ibid,
               Section&nbsp;6.7), or "dkim-quoted-printable" (as defined in
               <xref target="dkim-quoted-printable"/>).
	       The name of the tag will determine the
               encoding of each value. Unencoded semicolon (";") characters MUST
               NOT occur in the tag value, since that separates tag-specs. <list>
                  <t>INFORMATIVE IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: Although the "plain text"
                     defined below (as "tag-value") only includes 7-bit
                     characters, an implementation that wished to anticipate
                     future standards would be advised not to preclude the use
                     of UTF-8-encoded (<xref target="RFC3629"/>) text in
		     tag=value lists. </t>

                     </figure>


            <t>Note that WSP is allowed anywhere around tags. In particular, any
               WSP after the "=" and any WSP before the terminating ";" is not
               part of the value; however, WSP inside the value is
               significant.</t>

            <t>Tags MUST be interpreted in a case-sensitive manner. Values MUST
               be processed as case sensitive unless the specific tag
               description of semantics specifies case insensitivity.</t>

            <t>Tags with duplicate names MUST NOT occur within a single
               tag-list; if a tag name does occur more than once, the entire
               tag-list is invalid.</t>

            <t>Whitespace within a value MUST be retained unless explicitly
               excluded by the specific tag description.</t>

            <t>Tag=value pairs that represent the default value MAY be included
               to aid legibility.</t>

            <t> Unrecognized tags MUST be ignored.</t>

            <t>Tags that have an empty value are not the same as omitted tags.
               An omitted tag is treated as having the default value; a tag with
               an empty value explicitly designates the empty string as the
               value. </t>

               <t>Selecting appropriate key sizes is a trade-off between cost,
                  performance, and risk. Since short RSA keys more easily
                  succumb to off-line attacks, Signers MUST use RSA keys of at
                  least 1024 bits for long-lived keys. Verifiers MUST be able to
                  validate signatures with keys ranging from 512 bits to 2048
                  bits, and they MAY be able to validate signatures with larger
                  keys. Verifier policies may use the length of the signing key
                  as one metric for determining whether a signature is
                  acceptable.</t>

            title="Canonicalization">

            <t>Some mail systems modify email in transit, potentially
               invalidating a signature. For most Signers, mild modification of
               email is immaterial to validation of the DKIM domain name's use.
               For such Signers, a canonicalization algorithm that survives
               modest in-transit modification is preferred.</t>

            <t>Other Signers demand that any modification of the email, however
               minor, result in a signature verification failure. These Signers
               prefer a canonicalization algorithm that does not tolerate
               in-transit modification of the signed email.</t>

            <t>Some Signers may be willing to accept modifications to header
               fields that are within the bounds of email standards such as <xref
                  target="RFC5322" />, but are unwilling to accept any
               modification to the body of messages.</t>

            <t>To satisfy all requirements, two canonicalization algorithms are
               defined for each of the header and the body: a "simple" algorithm

               that tolerates common modifications such as whitespace
               replacement and header field line rewrapping. A Signer MAY
               specify either algorithm for header or body when signing an
               email. If no canonicalization algorithm is specified by the
               Signer, the "simple" algorithm defaults for both header and body.
               Verifiers MUST implement both canonicalization algorithms. Note
               that the header and body may use different canonicalization
               algorithms. Further canonicalization algorithms MAY be defined in
               the future; Verifiers MUST ignore any signatures that use
               unrecognized canonicalization algorithms.</t>

            <t>Canonicalization simply prepares the email for presentation to
               the signing or verification algorithm. It MUST NOT change the
               transmitted data in any way. Canonicalization of header fields
               and body are described below.</t>

                  <t>The AUID is specified as having the same syntax as an email
                     address but it need not have the same semantics.
                     Notably, the domain name need not be registered
                     in the DNS -- so it might not resolve in a query -- and the
                     local-part MAY be drawn from a namespace unrelated to any
                     mailbox. The details of the structure and semantics for the
                     namespace are determined by the Signer. Any knowledge or
                     use of those details by Verifiers or Assessors is outside
                     the scope of this specification. The Signer MAY
                     choose to use the same namespace for its AUIDs as its
                     users' email addresses or MAY choose other means of
                     representing its users. However, the Signer SHOULD use the
                     same AUID for each message intended to be evaluated as
                     being within the same sphere of responsibility, if it
                     wishes to offer receivers the option of using the AUID as a
                     stable identifier that is finer grained than the SDID. 
                   <list>
                        <t>INFORMATIVE NOTE: The local-part of the "i=" tag is
                           optional because in some cases a Signer may not be
                           able to establish a verified individual identity. In
                           such cases, the Signer might wish to assert that
                           although it is willing to go as far as signing for
                           the domain, it is unable or unwilling to commit to an
                           individual user name within the domain. It can do
                           so by including the domain part but not the
                           local-part of the identity.</t>
                        <t>INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION: This specification does not
                           require the value of the "i=" tag to match the
                           identity in any message header fields. This is
                           considered to be a Verifier policy issue. Constraints
                           between the value of the "i=" tag and other
                           identities in other header fields seek to apply basic
                           authentication into the semantics of trust associated
                           with a role such as content author. Trust is a broad
                           and complex topic, and trust mechanisms are subject to
                           highly creative attacks. The real-world efficacy of
                           any but the most basic bindings between the "i="
                           value and other identities is not well established,
                           nor is its vulnerability to subversion by an
                           attacker. Hence, reliance on the use of these options
                           should be strictly limited. In particular, it is not
                           at all clear to what extent a typical end-user
                           recipient can rely on any assurances that might be
                           made by successful use of the "i=" options.</t>

            <t>Signature applications require some level of assurance that the
               verification public key is associated with the claimed Signer.
               Many applications achieve this by using public-key certificates
               issued by a trusted third party. However, DKIM can achieve a
               sufficient level of security, with significantly enhanced
               scalability, by simply having the Verifier query the purported
               Signer's DNS entry (or some security-equivalent) in order to
               retrieve the public key.</t>

            <t>DKIM keys can potentially be stored in multiple types of key
               servers and in multiple formats. The storage and format of keys
               are irrelevant to the remainder of the DKIM algorithm.</t>

            <t>Parameters to the key lookup algorithm are the type of the lookup
               (the "q=" tag), the domain of the Signer (the "d=" tag of the
               DKIM-Signature header field), and the selector
	       (the "s=" tag).

            <t>This document defines a single binding, using DNS TXT RRs
	       to distribute the keys.  Other bindings may be defined

               <t>It is expected that many key servers will choose to present
                  the keys in an otherwise unstructured text format (for
                  example, an XML form would not be considered to be
                  unstructured text for this purpose). The following definition
                  MUST be used for any DKIM key represented in an otherwise
                  unstructured textual form.</t>

            title="Computing the Message Hashes">

            <t>Both signing and verifying message signatures start with a step
               of computing two cryptographic hashes over the message. Signers
               will choose the parameters of the signature as described in
               "Signer Actions" (<xref
                  target="signer"/>); Verifiers will use the parameters
               specified in the DKIM-Signature header field being verified. In
               the following discussion, the names of the tags in the
               DKIM-Signature header field that either exists (when verifying)
               or will be created (when signing) are used. Note that
               canonicalization (<xref
                  target="canon" />) is only used to prepare the email for
               signing or verifying; it does not affect the transmitted email in
               any way.</t>

            <t>The Signer/Verifier MUST compute two hashes: one over the body of
               the message and one over the selected header fields of the
               message.</t>


            <t>Signers MUST compute them in the order shown. Verifiers MAY
               compute them in any order convenient to the Verifier, provided
               that the result is semantically identical to the semantics that
               would be the case had they been computed in this order.</t>

            <t>In hash step 1, the Signer/Verifier MUST hash the message body,
               canonicalized using the body canonicalization algorithm specified
               in the "c=" tag and then truncated to the length specified in the
               "l=" tag. That hash value is then converted to base64 form and
               inserted into (Signers) or compared to (Verifiers) the "bh=" tag
               of the DKIM-Signature header field.</t>

            <t>In hash step 2, the Signer/Verifier MUST pass the following to
               the hash algorithm in the indicated order. <list
                  style="numbers">
                  <t>The header fields specified by the "h=" tag, in the order
                     specified in that tag, and canonicalized using the header
                     canonicalization algorithm specified in the "c=" tag. Each
                     header field MUST be terminated with a single CRLF. </t>
                  <t>The DKIM-Signature header field that exists (verifying) or
                     will be inserted (signing) in the message, with the value
                     of the "b=" tag (including all surrounding whitespace)
                     deleted (i.e., treated as the empty string), canonicalized
                     using the header canonicalization algorithm specified in
                     the "c=" tag, and without a trailing CRLF. </t>
               </list></t>

            <t>All tags and their values in the DKIM-Signature header field are
               included in the cryptographic hash with the sole exception of the
               value portion of the "b=" (signature) tag, which MUST be treated
               as the null string. All tags MUST be included even if they might
               not be understood by the Verifier. The header field MUST be
               presented to the hash algorithm after the body of the message
               rather than with the rest of the header fields and MUST be
               canonicalized as specified in the "c=" (canonicalization) tag.
               The DKIM-Signature header field MUST NOT be included in its own
               "h=" tag, although other DKIM-Signature header fields MAY be signed
               (see <xref
                  target="multisig" />).</t>

            <t>When calculating the hash on messages that will be transmitted
               using base64 or quoted-printable encoding, Signers MUST compute
               the hash after the encoding. Likewise, the Verifier MUST
               incorporate the values into the hash before decoding the base64
               or quoted-printable text. However, the hash MUST be computed
               before transport-level encodings such as SMTP "dot-stuffing" (the
               modification of lines beginning with a "." to avoid confusion
               with the SMTP end-of-message marker, as specified in <xref
                  target="RFC5321" />).</t>

            <t>With the exception of the canonicalization procedure described in <xref
                  target="canon" />, the DKIM signing process treats the body of
               messages as simply a string of octets. DKIM messages MAY be
               either in plain-text or in MIME format; no special treatment is
               afforded to MIME content. Message attachments in MIME format MUST
               be included in the content that is signed.</t>

            <t>In some circumstances, it is desirable for a domain to apply a
               signature on behalf of any of its subdomains without the need to
               maintain separate selectors (key records) in each subdomain. By
               default, private keys corresponding to key records can be used to
               sign messages for any subdomain of the domain in which they
               reside; for example, a key record for the domain example.com can
               be used to verify messages where the AUID ("i=" tag of the
               signature) is sub.example.com, or even sub1.sub2.example.com. In
               order to limit the capability of such keys when this is not
               intended, the "s" flag MAY be set in the "t=" tag of the key
               record, to constrain the validity of the domain of the AUID. If
               the referenced key record contains the "s" flag as part of the
               "t=" tag, the domain of the AUID ("i=" flag) MUST be the same as
               that of the SDID (d=) domain. If this flag is absent, the domain
               of the AUID MUST be the same as, or a subdomain of, the SDID.</t>

         <section
            title="Relationship between SDID and AUID">

            <t>DKIM's primary task is to communicate from the Signer to a
               recipient-side Identity Assessor a single Signing Domain
               Identifier (SDID) that refers to a responsible identity. DKIM MAY
               optionally provide a single responsible Agent or User Identifier
               (AUID).</t>

            <t>Hence, DKIM's mandatory output to a receive-side Identity
               Assessor is a single domain name. Within the scope of its use as
               DKIM output, the name has only basic domain name semantics; any
               possible owner-specific semantics are outside the scope of DKIM.
               That is, within its role as a DKIM identifier, additional
               semantics cannot be assumed by an Identity Assessor.</t>

            <t>Upon successfully verifying the signature, a receive-side DKIM
               Verifier MUST communicate the Signing Domain Identifier (d=) to a
               consuming Identity Assessor module and MAY communicate the Agent
               or User Identifier (i=) if present.</t>

            <t>To the extent that a receiver attempts to intuit any structured
               semantics for either of the identifiers, this is a heuristic
               function that is outside the scope of DKIM's specification and
               semantics. Hence, it is relegated to a higher-level service, such
               as a delivery-handling filter that integrates a variety of inputs
               and performs heuristic analysis of them. <list>
                  <t>INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION: This document does not require the
                     value of the SDID or AUID to match an identifier in any
                     other message header field. This requirement is, instead,
                     an Assessor policy issue. The purpose of such a linkage
                     would be to authenticate the value in that other header
                     field. This, in turn, is the basis for applying a trust
                     assessment based on the identifier value. Trust is a broad
                     and complex topic, and trust mechanisms are subject to
                     highly creative attacks. The real-world efficacy of any but
                     the most basic bindings between the SDID or AUID and other
                     identities is not well established, nor is its
                     vulnerability to subversion by an attacker. Hence, reliance
                     on the use of such bindings should be strictly limited. In
                     particular, it is not at all clear to what extent a typical
                     end-user recipient can rely on any assurances that might be
                     made by successful use of the SDID or AUID.</t>

         title="Semantics of Multiple Signatures">

         <section
            title="Example Scenarios">

            <t>There are many reasons why a message might have multiple
               signatures. For example, suppose SHA-256 is in the future found
                     to be insufficiently strong, and DKIM usage transitions to
                     SHA-1024. A Signer might immediately sign using the newer
                     algorithm but also continue to sign using the older
		     algorithm for interoperability with Verifiers that had
		     not yet upgraded. The Signer would do this by adding two
                     DKIM-Signature header fields, one using each algorithm.
                     Older Verifiers that did not recognize SHA-1024 as an
                     acceptable algorithm would skip that signature and use the
                     older algorithm; newer Verifiers could use either signature
                     at their option and, all other things being equal, might not
                     even attempt to verify the other signature.</t>

            <t>Similarly, a Signer might sign a message including all header
               fields and no "l=" tag (to satisfy strict Verifiers) and a
	       second time with a limited set of header fields and an "l="
	       tag (in anticipation of possible message modifications en route
	       to other Verifiers).  Verifiers could then choose which
	       signature they prefer. </t>

            <t>Of course, a message might also have multiple signatures because
               it passed through multiple Signers. A common case is expected to
               be that of a signed message that passes through a mailing list
               that also signs all messages. Assuming both of those signatures
               verify, a recipient might choose to accept the message if either
               of those signatures were known to come from trusted sources. </t>

                  <t>In particular, recipients might choose to whitelist
                     mailing lists to which they have subscribed and that have
                     acceptable anti-abuse policies so as to accept messages
                     sent to that list even from unknown authors. They might
                     also subscribe to less trusted mailing lists (e.g., those
                     without anti-abuse protection) and be willing to accept all
                     messages from specific authors but insist on doing
                     additional abuse scanning for other messages.</t>

            <t>Another related example of multiple Signers might be forwarding
               services, such as those commonly associated with academic alumni
               sites. For example, a recipient might have an address at
                     members.example.org, a site that has anti-abuse protection
                     that is somewhat less effective than the recipient would
                     prefer. Such a recipient might have specific authors whose
                     messages would be trusted absolutely, but messages from
                     unknown authors that had passed the forwarder's scrutiny
                     would have only medium trust.</t>
         </section>

         <section
            title="Interpretation">

            <t>A Signer that is adding a signature to a message merely creates a
               new DKIM-Signature header, using the usual semantics of the "h="
               option. A Signer MAY sign previously existing DKIM-Signature
               header fields using the method described in <xref
                  target="fields2sign" /> to sign trace header fields. </t>
	    <t> Note that Signers should be cognizant that signing
                     DKIM-Signature header fields may result in signature
                     failures with intermediaries that do not recognize that
                     DKIM-Signature header fields are trace header fields and
                     unwittingly reorder them, thus breaking such signatures.
                     For this reason, signing existing DKIM-Signature header
                     fields is unadvised, albeit legal.</t>
	    <t> <list>
                  <t>INFORMATIVE NOTE: If a header field with multiple instances
                     is signed, those header fields are always signed from the
                     bottom up. Thus, it is not possible to sign only specific
                     DKIM-Signature header fields. For example, if the message
                     being signed already contains three DKIM-Signature header
                     fields A, B, and C, it is possible to sign all of them, B
                     and C only, or C only, but not A only, B only, A and B
                     only, or A and C only.</t>
               </list></t>

            <t>A Signer MAY add more than one DKIM-Signature header field using
               different parameters. For example, during a transition period, a
               Signer might want to produce signatures using two different hash
               algorithms.</t>

            <t>Signers SHOULD NOT remove any DKIM-Signature header fields from
               messages they are signing, even if they know that the signatures
               cannot be verified.</t>

            <t>When evaluating a message with multiple signatures, a Verifier
               SHOULD evaluate signatures independently and on their own merits.
               For example, a Verifier that by policy chooses not to accept
               signatures with deprecated cryptographic algorithms would
               consider such signatures invalid. Verifiers MAY process
               signatures in any order of their choice; for example, some
               Verifiers might choose to process signatures corresponding to the
               From field in the message header before other signatures. See <xref
                  target="extractsig" /> for more information about signature
               choices. <list>
                  <t>INFORMATIVE IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: Verifier attempts to
                     correlate valid signatures with invalid signatures in an
                     attempt to guess why a signature failed are ill-advised. In
                     particular, there is no general way that a Verifier can
                     determine that an invalid signature was ever valid.</t>
               </list></t>

            <t>Verifiers SHOULD continue to
	       check signatures until a signature successfully verifies to the
               satisfaction of the Verifier. To limit potential
               denial-of-service attacks, Verifiers MAY limit the total number
               of signatures they will attempt to verify.</t>

	    <t>If a Verifier module reports signatures whose evaluations
               produced PERMFAIL results, Identity Assessors SHOULD ignore
               those signatures (see <xref target="extractsig"/>), acting
	       as though they were not present in the message. </t>

            <t>A Signer can obviously only sign email for domains for which it

               corresponding public key and selector information. However, there
               are a number of other reasons beyond the lack of a private key
               why a Signer could choose not to sign an email. <list>
                  <t>INFORMATIVE NOTE: A Signer can be implemented as part of
                     any portion of the mail system as deemed appropriate,
                     including an MUA, a SUBMISSION server, or an MTA. Wherever
                     implemented, Signers should beware of signing (and thereby
                     asserting responsibility for) messages that may be
                     problematic. In particular, within a trusted enclave, the
                     signing domain might be derived from the header according
                     to local policy; SUBMISSION servers might only sign
                     messages from users that are properly authenticated and
                     authorized.</t>
                  <t>INFORMATIVE IMPLEMENTER ADVICE: SUBMISSION servers should
                     not sign Received header fields if the outgoing gateway MTA

            <t>This specification does not define the basis by which a Signer
               should choose which private key and selector information to use.
               Currently, all selectors are equal as far as this specification
               is concerned, so the decision should largely be a matter of
               administrative convenience. Distribution and management of
               private keys is also outside the scope of this document. <list>
                  <t>INFORMATIVE OPERATIONS ADVICE: A Signer should not sign
                     with a private key when the selector containing the
                     corresponding public key is expected to be revoked or
                     removed before the Verifier has an opportunity to validate
                     the signature. The Signer should anticipate that Verifiers
                     can choose to defer validation, perhaps until the message
                     is actually read by the final recipient. In particular,
                     when rotating to a new key pair, signing should immediately
                     commence with the new private key, and the old public key
                     should be retained for a reasonable validation interval
                     before being removed from the key server.</t>

            title="Normalize the Message to Prevent Transport Conversions">

            <t>Some messages, particularly those using 8-bit characters, are
               subject to modification during transit, notably conversion to
               7-bit form. Such conversions will break DKIM signatures. In order
               to minimize the chances of such breakage, Signers SHOULD convert
               the message to a suitable MIME content-transfer encoding such as
               quoted-printable or base64 as described in <xref
                  target="RFC2045" /> before signing. Such conversion is outside
               the scope of DKIM; the actual message SHOULD be converted to
               7-bit MIME by an MUA or MSA prior to presentation to the DKIM
               algorithm.</t>

            <t>If the message is submitted to the Signer with any local encoding
               that will be modified before transmission, that modification to
               canonical <xref
                  target="RFC5322" /> form MUST be done before signing. In
               particular, bare CR or LF characters (used by some systems as a
               local line separator convention) MUST be converted to the
               SMTP-standard CRLF sequence before the message is signed. Any
               conversion of this sort SHOULD be applied to the message actually
               sent to the recipient(s), not just to the version presented to
               the signing algorithm.</t>

            <t>More generally, the Signer MUST sign the message as it is
               expected to be received by the Verifier rather than in some local
               or internal form.</t>

                        the list). Until those messages are also signed, the
                        body length count is a useful tool for the Verifier
                        since it can, as a matter of policy, accept messages
                        having valid signatures with extraneous data.</t>

                  data to be appended to the end of the body of a signed

                  the canonicalization algorithm; for example, any whitespace
                  ignored by a canonicalization algorithm is not included as
                  part of the body length count. </t>

            <t>The From header field MUST be signed (that is, included in the

               legitimately modified or removed in transit. In particular, <xref

               of the Return-Path header field in transit. Signers MAY include
               any other header fields present at the time of signing at the
               discretion of the Signer. <list>
                  <t>INFORMATIVE OPERATIONS NOTE: The choice of which header
                     fields to sign is non-obvious. One strategy is to sign all
                     existing, non- repeatable header fields. An alternative
                     strategy is to sign only header fields that are likely to
                     be displayed to or otherwise be likely to affect the
                     processing of the message at the receiver. A third strategy
                     is to sign only "well-known" headers. Note that Verifiers
                     may treat unsigned header fields with extreme skepticism,
                     including refusing to display them to the end user or even
                     ignoring the signature if it does not cover certain header
                     fields. For this reason, signing fields present in the
                     message such as Date, Subject, Reply-To, Sender, and all
                     MIME header fields are highly advised.</t>

            <t> The DKIM-Signature header field is always implicitly signed and

            <t>Signers MAY claim to have signed header fields that do not exist
               (that is, Signers MAY include the header field name in the "h="
               tag even if that header field does not exist in the message).
               When computing the signature, the nonexisting header field MUST
               be treated as the null string (including the header field name,
               header field value, all punctuation, and the trailing CRLF). <list>
                  <t>INFORMATIVE RATIONALE: This allows Signers to explicitly
                     assert the absence of a header field; if that header field

                     further additions. For example, if there is a single
                     Comments header field at the time of signing, listing
                     Comments twice in the "h=" tag is sufficient to prevent any
                     number of Comments header fields from being appended; it is
                     not necessary (but is legal) to list Comments three or more

               have additional instances added later in the delivery process,
               since such header fields might be inserted after the signed
               instance or otherwise reordered. Trace header fields (such as
               Received) and Resent-* blocks are the only fields prohibited by <xref
                  target="RFC5322" /> from being reordered. In particular, since
               DKIM-Signature header fields may be reordered by some
               intermediate MTAs, signing existing DKIM-Signature header fields
               is error-prone. <list>
                  <t>INFORMATIVE ADMONITION: Despite the fact that <xref
                        target="RFC5322" /> does not prohibit
		     the reordering of header fields,
                     reordering of signed header fields with multiple instances
                     by intermediate MTAs will cause DKIM signatures to be
                     broken; such antisocial behavior should be avoided.</t>
                  <t>INFORMATIVE IMPLEMENTER'S NOTE: Although not required by
                     this specification, all end-user visible header fields
                     should be signed to avoid possible "indirect spamming". For
                     example, if the Subject header field is not signed, a
                     spammer can resend a previously signed mail, replacing the
                     legitimate subject with a one-line spam.</t>
               </list></t>

           <section
              title="Recommended Signature Content">
		<t> The purpose of the DKIM cryptographic algorithm is to
		    affix an identifier to the message in a way that is both
		    robust against normal transit-related changes and
		    resistant to kinds of replay attacks.  An essential
		    aspect of satisfying these requirements is choosing what
		    header fields to include in the hash and what fields to
		    exclude. </t>

		<t> The basic rule for choosing fields to include is to
		    select those fields that constitute the "core" of the
		    message content.  Hence, any replay attack will have to
		    include these in order to have the signature succeed;
		    however, with these included, the core of the message is valid,
		    even if sent on to new recipients. </t>

		<t> Common examples of fields with addresses and fields
		    with textual content related to the body are:

		    <list style="symbols">
			<t> From (REQUIRED; see
			    <xref target="fields2sign"/>) </t>
			<t> Reply-To </t>
			<t> Subject </t>
			<t> Date </t>
			<t> To, Cc </t>
			<t> Resent-Date, Resent-From, Resent-To, Resent-Cc </t>
			<t> In-Reply-To, References </t>
			<t> List-Id, List-Help, List-Unsubscribe,
			    List-Subscribe, List-Post, List-Owner,
			    List-Archive </t>
		    </list> </t>

		<t> If the "l=" signature tag is in use (see
		    <xref target="dkimsighead"/>), the Content-Type field
		    is also a candidate for being included as it could be
		    replaced in a way that causes completely different
		    content to be rendered to the receiving user. </t>

		<t> There are trade-offs in the decision of what constitutes
		    the "core" of the message, which for some fields is a
		    subjective concept.  Including fields such as "Message-ID",
		    for example, is useful if one considers a mechanism for
		    being able to distinguish separate instances of the same
		    message to be core content.  Similarly, "In-Reply-To"
		    and "References" might be desirable to include if one
		    considers message threading to be a core part of the
		    message. </t>

		<t> Another class of fields that may be of interest are those
		    that convey security-related information about the
		    message, such as Authentication-Results
		    <xref target="RFC5451"/>. </t>

		<t> The basic rule for choosing fields to exclude is to
		    select those fields for which there are multiple fields
		    with the same name and fields that are modified in
		    transit.  Examples of these are:

		    <list style="symbols">
			<t> Return-Path </t>
			<t> Received </t>
			<t> Comments, Keywords </t>
		    </list> </t>

		<t> Note that the DKIM-Signature field is also excluded from
		    the header hash because its handling is specified
		    separately. </t>

		<t> Typically, it is better to exclude other optional fields
		    because of the potential that additional fields of the
		    same name will be legitimately added or reordered prior
		    to verification.  There are likely to be legitimate
		    exceptions to this rule because of the wide variety
                    of application-specific header fields that might be
		    applied to a message, some of which are unlikely to be
		    duplicated, modified, or reordered.</t>

            <t>Signers SHOULD choose canonicalization algorithms based on the
               types of messages they process and their aversion to risk. For
               example, e-commerce sites sending primarily purchase receipts,
               which are not expected to be processed by mailing lists or other
               software likely to modify messages, will generally prefer
               "simple" canonicalization. Sites sending primarily
               person-to-person email will likely prefer to be more resilient to
               modification during transport by using "relaxed"
               canonicalization.</t>

            <t>Unless mail is processed through intermediaries, such as
	       mailing lists that might add "unsubscribe" instructions to
	       the bottom of the message body, the "l=" tag is likely to
	       convey no additional benefit while providing an avenue for
	       unauthorized addition of text to a message.  The use of "l=0"
	       takes this to the extreme, allowing complete alteration of the
	       text of the message without invalidating the signature.
	       Moreover, a Verifier would be within its rights to consider a
	       partly signed message body as unacceptable.  Judicious use is
	       advised. </t>

         title="Verifier Actions">

         <t>Since a Signer MAY remove or revoke a public key at any time, it is
            advised that verification occur in a timely manner. In many
            configurations, the most timely place is during acceptance by the
            border MTA or shortly thereafter. In particular, deferring
            verification until the message is accessed by the end user is
            discouraged.</t>

         <t>A border or intermediate MTA MAY verify the message signature(s). An
            MTA who has performed verification MAY communicate the result of
            that verification by adding a verification header field to incoming
            messages. This simplifies things considerably for the user, who can
            now use an existing mail user agent. Most MUAs have the ability to
            filter messages based on message header fields or content; these
            filters would be used to implement whatever policy the user wishes
            with respect to unsigned mail.</t>

         <t>A verifying MTA MAY implement a policy with respect to unverifiable
            mail, regardless of whether or not it applies the verification
            header field to signed messages.</t>

         <t>Verifiers MUST produce a result that is semantically equivalent to
            applying the steps listed in Sections <xref target="extractsig"
format="counter" />, <xref target="validatesig"
format="counter" />, and <xref target="pubkey" format="counter" /> in order. In practice,
            several of these steps can be performed in parallel in order to
            improve performance.</t>


         <section
            anchor="extractsig"
            title="Extract Signatures from the Message">

            <t> The order in which Verifiers try DKIM-Signature header fields is
               not defined; Verifiers MAY try signatures in any order they like.
               For example, one implementation might try the signatures in
               textual order, whereas another might try signatures by identities
               that match the contents of the From header field before trying
               other signatures. Verifiers MUST NOT attribute ultimate meaning
               to the order of multiple DKIM-Signature header fields. In
               particular, there is reason to believe that some relays will
               reorder the header fields in potentially arbitrary ways. <list>
                  <t>INFORMATIVE IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: Verifiers might use the
                     order as a clue to signing order in the absence of any
                     other information. However, other clues as to the semantics
                     of multiple signatures (such as correlating the signing
                     host with Received header fields) might also be
                     considered.</t>
               </list></t>

            <t>Survivability of signatures after transit is not guaranteed,
	       and signatures can fail to verify
	       through no fault of the Signer.  Therefore, a Verifier SHOULD
	       NOT treat a message that has one or more bad signatures and no
	       good signatures differently from a message with no signature
	       at all. </t>

            <t>When a signature successfully verifies, a Verifier will either
               stop processing or attempt to verify any other signatures, at the
               discretion of the implementation. A Verifier MAY limit the number
               of signatures it tries, in order to avoid denial-of-service
	       attacks (see <xref target="key_dos"/> for further
	       discussion). </t>

            <t>In the following description, text reading "return status
               (explanation)" (where "status" is one of "PERMFAIL" or
               "TEMPFAIL") means that the Verifier MUST immediately cease
               processing that signature. The Verifier SHOULD proceed to the
               next signature, if one is present, and completely ignore the bad
               signature. If the status is "PERMFAIL", the signature failed and
               should not be reconsidered. If the status is "TEMPFAIL", the
               signature could not be verified at this time but may be tried
               again later. A Verifier MAY either arrange to defer the message
	       for later processing or try another signature; if no good
	       signature is found and any of the signatures resulted in a
	       TEMPFAIL status, the Verifier MAY arrange to defer the message
	       for later processing. The "(explanation)" is not normative
	       text; it is provided solely for clarification.</t>

            <t>Verifiers that are prepared to
               validate multiple signature header fields SHOULD proceed to the
               next signature header field, if one exists. However, Verifiers
               MAY make note of the fact that an invalid signature was present
               for consideration at a later step. <list>
                  <t>INFORMATIVE NOTE: The rationale of this requirement is to
                     permit messages that have invalid signatures but also a
                     valid signature to work. For example, a mailing list
                     exploder might opt to leave the original submitter
                     signature in place even though the exploder knows that it
                     is modifying the message in some way that will break that
                     signature, and the exploder inserts its own signature. In
                     this case, the message should succeed even in the presence
                     of the known-broken signature.</t>
               </list></t>

            <t>For each signature to be validated, the following steps should be
               performed in such a manner as to produce a result that is
               semantically equivalent to performing them in the indicated
               order.</t>

                  depends on the query type as defined by the "q=" tag in the
                  DKIM-Signature header field. Obviously, a public key need only
                  be retrieved if the process of extracting the signature
                  information is completely successful. Details of key
                  management and representation are described in <xref
                     target="keymgmt" />. The Verifier MUST validate the key
                  record and MUST ignore any public-key records that are
                  malformed.</t>

                  performing them in the order indicated; in some cases, the
                  implementation may parallelize or reorder these steps, as long

                        remainder of these steps on each record at the
                        discretion of the implementer. The order of the key

               title="Compute the Verification">

               <t>Given a Signer and a public key, verifying a signature
                  consists of actions semantically equivalent to the following
                  steps. <list
                     style="numbers">
                     <t>Based on the algorithm defined in the "c=" tag, the body
                        length specified in the "l=" tag, and the header field
                        names in the "h=" tag, prepare a canonicalized version
                        of the message as is described in <xref
                           target="msghash" /> (note that this canonicalized
			version does not actually replace the original
			content). When matching header
                        field names in the "h=" tag against the actual message
                        header field, comparisons MUST be case-insensitive.</t>
                     <t>Based on the algorithm indicated in the "a=" tag,
                        compute the message hashes from the canonical copy as
                        described in <xref
                           target="msghash" />.</t>
                     <t>Verify that the hash of the canonicalized message body
                        computed in the previous step matches the hash value
                        conveyed in the "bh=" tag. If the hash does not match,
                        the Verifier SHOULD ignore the signature and return
                        PERMFAIL (body hash did not verify).</t>
                     <t> Using the signature conveyed in the "b=" tag, verify
                        the signature against the header hash using the
                        mechanism appropriate for the public-key algorithm
                        described in the "a=" tag. If the signature does not
                        validate, the Verifier SHOULD ignore the signature and
                        return PERMFAIL (signature did not verify).</t>
                     <t>Otherwise, the signature has correctly verified.</t>

                  <list>
                     <t>INFORMATIVE IMPLEMENTER'S NOTE: Implementations might
                        wish to initiate the public-key query in parallel with
                        calculating the hash as the public key is not needed
                        until the final decryption is calculated.
                        Implementations may also verify the signature on the
                        message header before validating that the message hash
                        listed in the "bh=" tag in the DKIM-Signature header
                        field matches that of the actual message body; however,
                        if the body hash does not match, the entire signature
                        must be considered to have failed.</t>
                  </list>
               </t>

               <t>A body length specified in the "l=" tag of the signature
                  limits the number of bytes of the body passed to the
                  verification algorithm. All data beyond that limit is not
                  validated by DKIM. Hence, Verifiers might treat a message
		  that contains bytes beyond the indicated body length with
                  suspicion and can choose to treat the signature as if it
		  were invalid (e.g., by returning PERMFAIL (unsigned
		  content)). </t>

		<t> Should the algorithm reach this point, the verification
		    has succeeded, and DKIM reports SUCCESS for this
		    signature. </t>

         <section
            title="Communicate Verification Results">

            <t>Verifiers wishing to communicate the results of verification to
               other parts of the mail system may do so in whatever manner they
               see fit. For example, implementations might choose to add an
               email header field to the message before passing it on. Any such
               header field SHOULD be inserted before any existing
               DKIM-Signature or preexisting authentication status header fields
               in the header field block. The Authentication-Results: header
               field (<xref
                  target="RFC5451" />) MAY be used for this purpose. <list>
                  <t>INFORMATIVE ADVICE to MUA filter writers: Patterns intended
                     to search for results header fields to visibly mark
                     authenticated mail for end users should verify that such a
                     header field was added by the appropriate verifying domain
                     and that the verified identity matches the author identity
                     that will be displayed by the MUA. In particular, MUA
                     filters should not be influenced by bogus results header
                     fields added by attackers. To circumvent this attack,
                     Verifiers MAY wish to request deletion of existing
		     results header fields after verification and before
		     arranging to add a new header field.</t>

         <section
            title="Interpret Results/Apply Local Policy">

            <t>It is beyond the scope of this specification to describe what
               actions an Identity Assessor can make, but mail carrying a
               validated SDID presents an opportunity to an Identity Assessor
               that unauthenticated email does not. Specifically, an
               authenticated email creates a predictable identifier by which
               other decisions can reliably be managed, such as trust and
               reputation. Conversely, unauthenticated email lacks a reliable
               identifier that can be used to assign trust and reputation. It is
               reasonable to treat unauthenticated email as lacking any trust
               and having no positive reputation.</t>

            <t>In general, modules that consume DKIM verification output SHOULD
	       NOT determine message acceptability based solely on a lack of
	       any signature or on an unverifiable
	       signature; such rejection would cause severe interoperability
	       problems.  If an MTA does wish to reject such messages during
	       an SMTP session (for example, when communicating
	       with a peer who, by prior agreement, agrees to only send signed
	       messages), and a signature is missing or does not verify, the
	       handling MTA SHOULD use a 550/5.7.x reply code.</t>

            <t>
               <figure
                  align="left">
                  <preamble>Where the Verifier is integrated within the MTA
		     and it is not possible to fetch the public key,
                     perhaps because the key server is not available, a
                     temporary failure message MAY be generated using a
                     451/4.7.5 reply code, such as: </preamble>
                  <artwork><![CDATA[
451 4.7.5 Unable to verify signature - key server unavailable]]></artwork>
               </figure>
            </t>

            <t>Temporary failures such as inability to access the key server or
               other external service are the only conditions that SHOULD use a
               4xx SMTP reply code. In particular, cryptographic signature
               verification failures MUST NOT provoke 4xx SMTP replies.</t>

            <t>Once the signature has been verified, that information MUST be
               conveyed to the Identity Assessor (such as an explicit allow/
               whitelist and reputation system) and/or to the end user. If the
               SDID is not the same as the address in the From: header field,
               the mail system SHOULD take pains to ensure that the actual SDID
	       is clear to the reader.</t>

            <t>While the symptoms of a failed verification are obvious -- the
               signature doesn't verify -- establishing the exact cause can be
               more difficult. If a selector cannot be found, is that because
               the selector has been removed, or was the value changed somehow
               in transit? If the signature line is missing, is that because it
               was never there, or was it removed by an overzealous filter? For
               diagnostic purposes, the exact reason why the verification fails
               SHOULD be made available and possibly
               recorded in the system logs. If the email cannot be verified,
               then it SHOULD be treated the same as all unverified
	       email, regardless of whether or not it looks like it was
               signed.</t>

                        may be conveyed by adjusting the spacing between words.
                        If this is a concern, the "simple" body canonicalization

         <section anchor="l_abuse"

		<t>Use of the "l=" tag might allow display of fraudulent
		content without appropriate warning to end users. The "l=" tag
		is intended for increasing signature robustness when
		sending to mailing lists that both modify their
		content and do not sign their modified messages. However,
		using the "l=" tag enables attacks in which an
                intermediary with malicious intent can modify a message
                to include content that solely benefits the attacker.
                It is possible for the appended content to completely
                replace the original content in the end recipient's
                eyes and to defeat duplicate message detection
                algorithms.  </t>




		<t> 
  An example of such an attack includes altering the MIME
  structure, exploiting lax HTML parsing in the MUA, and defeating
  duplicate message detection algorithms.
</t>

                <t> To avoid this attack, Signers should be extremely wary of
		using this tag, and Assessors might wish to ignore signatures
		that use the tag.  </t>

         <section
            title="Misappropriated Private Key">
            <t>As with any other security application that uses private- or
               public-key pairs, DKIM requires caution around the handling and
	       protection of keys.  A compromised private key or access to one
	       means an intruder or malware can send mail signed by the
	       domain that advertises the matching public key. </t>

	    <t>Thus, private keys issued to users, rather than one used by
	       an ADministrative Management Domain (ADMD) itself, create the usual problem of securing data
	       stored on personal resources that can affect the ADMD. </t> 

            <t>A more secure architecture involves sending messages
               through an outgoing MTA that can authenticate the submitter using
               existing techniques (e.g., SMTP Authentication), possibly
               validate the message itself (e.g., verify that the header is
               legitimate and that the content passes a spam content check), and
               sign the message using a key appropriate for the submitter
               address. Such an MTA can also apply controls on the volume of
               outgoing mail each user is permitted to originate in order to
               further limit the ability of malware to generate bulk email.</t>

         <section anchor="key_dos"
            title="Key Server Denial-of-Service Attacks">

            <t>Since the key servers are distributed (potentially separate for
               each domain), the number of servers that would need to be
               attacked to defeat this mechanism on an Internet-wide basis is
               very large. Nevertheless, key servers for individual domains
               could be attacked, impeding the verification of messages from
               that domain. This is not significantly different from the ability
               of an attacker to deny service to the mail exchangers for a given
               domain, although it affects outgoing, not incoming, mail.</t>

            <t>A variation on this attack involves a very large amount of mail
               being sent using spoofed signatures from a given domain: the
               key servers for that domain could be overwhelmed with requests
	       in a denial-of-service attack (see <xref target="RFC4732"/>).
               However, given the low overhead of verification compared with
               handling of the email message itself, such an attack would be
               difficult to mount.</t>

         <section
            title="Attacks against the DNS">

            <t>Since the DNS is a required binding for key services, specific
               attacks against the DNS must be considered.</t>

            <t>While the DNS is currently insecure <xref
                  target="RFC3833" />, these security problems are the
               motivation behind DNS Security (DNSSEC) <xref
                  target="RFC4033" />, and all users of the DNS will reap the
               benefit of that work.</t>

            <t>DKIM is only intended as a "sufficient" method of proving
               authenticity. It is not intended to provide strong cryptographic
               proof about authorship or contents. Other technologies such as
               OpenPGP <xref
                  target="RFC4880" /> and S/MIME <xref
                  target="RFC5751" /> address those requirements.</t>

            <t>A second security issue related to the DNS revolves around the
               increased DNS traffic as a consequence of fetching selector-based
               data as well as fetching signing domain policy. Widespread
               deployment of DKIM will result in a significant increase in DNS
               queries to the claimed signing domain. In the case of forgeries
               on a large scale, DNS servers could see a substantial increase in
               queries.</t>

            <t>A specific DNS security issue that should be considered by DKIM
               Verifiers is the name chaining attack described in Section 2.3 of <xref
                  target="RFC3833" />. A DKIM Verifier, while verifying a
               DKIM-Signature header field, could be prompted to retrieve a key
               record of an attacker's choosing. This threat can be minimized by
               ensuring that name servers, including recursive name servers,
               used by the Verifier enforce strict checking of "glue" and other
               additional information in DNS responses and are therefore not
               vulnerable to this attack.</t>

         </section>

         <section
            title="Replay/Spam Attacks">
            <t>In this attack, a spammer sends a piece of spam through an
	       MTA that signs it, banking on the reputation of the signing
	       domain (e.g., a large popular mailbox provider) rather than
	       its own, and then re-sends that message to a large number of
	       intended recipients.  The recipients observe the valid
	       signature from the well-known domain, elevating their trust in
	       the message and increasing the likelihood of delivery and
	       presentation to the user. </t>

            <t>Partial solutions to this problem involve the use of reputation
               services to convey the fact that the specific email address is
               being used for spam and that messages from that Signer are likely
               to be spam. This requires a real-time detection mechanism in
               order to react quickly enough. However, such measures might be
               prone to abuse, if, for example, an attacker re-sent a large number
               of messages received from a victim in order to make the victim appear
               to be a spammer.</t>

            <t>Large Verifiers might be able to detect unusually large volumes
               of mails with the same signature in a short time period. Smaller
               Verifiers can get substantially the same volume of information
               via existing collaborative systems.</t>

               one of its users, it might wish to revoke the key used to sign
               that user's messages in order to disavow responsibility for
               messages that have not yet been verified or that are the subject
               of a replay attack. However, the ability of the domain to do so
               can be limited if the same key, for scalability reasons, is used
               to sign messages for many other users. Mechanisms for explicitly
               revoking keys on a per-address basis have been proposed but
               require further study as to their utility and the DNS load they
               represent.</t>

         <section
            title="Intentionally Malformed Key Records">

            <t>It is possible for an attacker to publish key records in DNS that
               are intentionally malformed, with the intent of causing a
               denial-of- service attack on a non-robust Verifier
               implementation. The attacker could then cause a Verifier to read
               the malformed key record by sending a message to one of its users
               referencing the malformed record in a (not necessarily valid)
               signature. Verifiers MUST thoroughly verify all key records
               retrieved from the DNS and be robust against intentionally as
               well as unintentionally malformed key records.</t>

         <section
            title="Intentionally Malformed DKIM-Signature Header Fields">

            <t>Verifiers MUST be prepared to receive messages with malformed
               DKIM-Signature header fields and thoroughly verify the header
               field before depending on any of its contents.</t>

         <section
            title="Information Leakage">

            <t>An attacker could determine when a particular signature was
               verified by using a per-message selector and then monitoring
               their DNS traffic for the key lookup. This would act as the
               equivalent of a "web bug" for verification time rather than the time
               the message was read.</t>

         <section
            title="Remote Timing Attacks">

            <t>In some cases, it may be possible to extract private keys using a
               remote timing attack <xref
                  target="BONEH03" />. Implementations should consider
               obfuscating the timing to prevent such attacks.</t>

         </section>

         <section
            title="Reordered Header Fields">

            <t>Existing standards allow intermediate MTAs to reorder header
               fields. If a Signer signs two or more header fields of the same
               name, this can cause spurious verification errors on otherwise
               legitimate messages. In particular, Signers that sign any
               existing DKIM-Signature fields run the risk of having messages
               incorrectly fail to verify.</t>

         </section>

         <section
            title="RSA Attacks">

            <t>An attacker could create a large RSA signing key with a small
               exponent, thus requiring that the verification key have a large
               exponent. This will force Verifiers to use considerable computing
               resources to verify the signature. Verifiers might avoid this
               attack by refusing to verify signatures that reference selectors
               with public keys having unreasonable exponents.</t>

            <t>In general, an attacker might try to overwhelm a Verifier by
               flooding it with messages requiring verification. This is similar
               to other MTA denial-of-service attacks and should be dealt with
               in a similar fashion.</t>

         </section>

         <section
            title="Inappropriate Signing by Parent Domains">

            <t>The trust relationship described in <xref
                  target="parentsig" /> could conceivably be used by a parent
               domain to sign messages with identities in a subdomain not
               administratively related to the parent. For example, the ".com"
               registry could create messages with signatures using an "i="
               value in the example.com domain. There is no general solution to
               this problem, since the administrative cut could occur anywhere
               in the domain name. For example, in the domain
               "example.podunk.ca.us", there are three administrative cuts
               (podunk.ca.us, ca.us, and us), any of which could create messages
               with an identity in the full domain. <list>
                  <t>INFORMATIVE NOTE: This is considered an acceptable risk for
                     the same reason that it is acceptable for domain
                     delegation. For example, in the case above, any of the
                     domains could potentially simply delegate
                     "example.podunk.ca.us" to a server of their choice and
                     completely replace all DNS-served information. Note that a
                     Verifier MAY ignore signatures that come from an unlikely
                     domain such as ".com", as discussed in <xref
                        target="validatesig" />.</t>

            title="Attacks Involving Extra Header Fields">
		<t> Many email components, including MTAs, MSAs, MUAs, and
		filtering modules, implement message format checks only
		loosely.  This is done out of years of industry pressure to
		be liberal in what is accepted into the mail stream for the
		sake of reducing support costs; improperly formed messages
		are often silently fixed in transit, delivered
		unrepaired, or displayed inappropriately (e.g., by showing
		only the first of multiple From: fields). </t>

		<t> Agents that evaluate or apply DKIM output need to be
		aware that a DKIM Signer can sign messages that are malformed
		(e.g., violate <xref target="RFC5322"/>, such as by having
		multiple instances of a field that is only permitted once),
		that become malformed in transit, or that contain header
		or body content that is not true or valid.  Use of DKIM on
		such messages might constitute an attack against a receiver,
		especially where additional credence is given to a signed
		message without adequate evaluation of the Signer. </t>

		<t> These can represent serious attacks, but they have nothing
		to do with DKIM; they are attacks on the recipient or on
		the wrongly identified author. </t>

		<t> Moreover, an agent would be incorrect to infer that all
		instances of a header field are signed just because one
		is. </t>

		<t> A genuine signature from the domain under attack can be
		obtained by legitimate means, but extra header fields can then
		be added, either by interception or by replay.  In this
		scenario, DKIM can aid in detecting addition of
		specific fields in transit.  This is done by having the
		Signer list the field name(s) in the "h=" tag an extra time
		(e.g., "h=from:from:..." for a message with one From field), 
		so that addition of an instance of that field downstream will
		render the signature unable to be verified.  (See
		<xref target="dkimsighead"/> for details.)  This, in essence,
		is an explicit indication that the Signer repudiates
		responsibility for such a malformed message. </t>

		<t> DKIM signs and validates the data it is told to and
		works correctly.  So in this case, DKIM has done its job of
		delivering a validated domain (the "d=" value) and, given the
		semantics of a DKIM signature, essentially the Signer has taken 
		some responsibility for a problematic message.  It is up to
		the Identity Assessor or some other subsequent agent to act on
		such messages as needed, such as degrading the trust of the
		message (or, indeed, of the Signer), warning the
		recipient, or even refusing delivery. </t>

		<t> All components of the mail system that perform loose
		enforcement of other mail standards will need to revisit that
		posture when incorporating DKIM, especially when considering
		matters of potential attacks such as those described. </t>

It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

To collaborate productively on this large and complex system, all participants need to work from a common view of it and use a common language to describe its components and the interactions among them.  But the many differences in perspective currently make it difficult to know exactly what another participant means.  To serve as the necessary common frame of reference, this document describes the enhanced Internet Mail architecture, reflecting the current service.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>
   STD 11, RFC 822, defines a message representation protocol specifying
   considerable detail about US-ASCII message headers, and leaves the
   message content, or message body, as flat US-ASCII text.  This set of
   documents, collectively called the Multipurpose Internet Mail
   Extensions, or MIME, redefines the format of messages to allow for

<list>
<t>
   (1) textual message bodies in character sets other than US-ASCII,
</t>
<t>
   (2) an extensible set of different formats for non-textual message
       bodies,
</t>
<t>
   (3) multi-part message bodies, and
</t>
<t>
   (4) textual header information in character sets other than US-ASCII.
</t></list></t>
<t>
   These documents are based on earlier work documented in RFC 934, STD
   11, and RFC 1049, but extends and revises them.  Because RFC 822 said
   so little about message bodies, these documents are largely
   orthogonal to (rather than a revision of) RFC 822.
</t>
<t>
   This particular document is the third document in the series.  It
   describes extensions to RFC 822 to allow non-US-ASCII text data in
   Internet mail header fields.
   Other documents in this series include:

<list>
<t>
   + RFC 2045, which specifies the various headers used to describe
     the structure of MIME messages.
</t>
<t>
   + RFC 2046, which defines the general structure of the MIME media
     typing system and defines an initial set of media types,
</t>
<t>
   + RFC 2048, which specifies various IANA registration procedures
     for MIME-related facilities, and
</t>
<t>
   + RFC 2049, which describes MIME conformance criteria and
     provides some illustrative examples of MIME message formats,
     acknowledgements, and the bibliography.
</t></list></t>
<t>
   These documents are revisions of RFCs 1521, 1522, and 1590, which
   themselves were revisions of RFCs 1341 and 1342.  An appendix in RFC
   2049 describes differences and changes from previous versions.

<t>ISO/IEC 10646-1 defines a large character set called the Universal Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the world's writing systems.

<abstract>
<t>Implementors of systems that use public key cryptography to exchange symmetric keys need to make the public keys resistant to some predetermined level of attack.  That level of attack resistance is the strength of the system, and the symmetric keys that are exchanged must be at least as strong as the system strength requirements.  The three quantities, system strength, symmetric key strength, and public key strength, must be consistently matched for any network protocol usage.  While it is fairly easy to express the system strength requirements in terms of a symmetric key length and to choose a cipher that has a key length equal to or exceeding that requirement, it is harder to choose a public key that has a cryptographic strength meeting a symmetric key strength requirement.  This document explains how to determine the length of an asymmetric key as a function of a symmetric key strength requirement.  Some rules of thumb for estimating equivalent resistance to large-scale attacks on various algorithms are given.  The document also addresses how changing the sizes of the underlying large integers (moduli, group sizes, exponents, and so on) changes the time to use the algorithms for key exchange.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t></abstract></front>

<t>Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec).

<t>This document provides an overview of the DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) service and describes how it can fit into a messaging service.  It also describes how DKIM relates to other IETF message signature technologies.  It is intended for those who are adopting, developing, or deploying DKIM.  DKIM allows an organization to take responsibility for transmitting a message, in a way that can be verified by a recipient.  The organization can be the author's, the originating sending site, an intermediary, or one of their agents.  A message can contain multiple signatures from the same or different organizations involved with the message.  DKIM defines a domain-level digital signature authentication framework for email, using public-key cryptography, with the domain name service as its key server technology (RFC 4871).  This permits verification of a responsible organization, as well as the integrity of the message contents.  DKIM also enables a mechanism that permits potential email signers to publish information about their email signing practices; this will permit email receivers to make additional assessments about messages.  DKIM's authentication of email identity can assist in the global control of "spam" and "phishing".  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract></front>

            <t>The signing email server requires access to the private key
               associated with the "brisbane" selector to generate this
               signature.</t>

         <section
            title="The Email Signature is Verified">

            <t>The signature is normally verified by an inbound SMTP server or
               possibly the final delivery agent. However, intervening MTAs can
               also perform this verification if they choose to do so. The
               verification process uses the domain "example.com" extracted from
               the "d=" tag and the selector "brisbane" from the "s=" tag in the
               DKIM-Signature header field to form the DNS DKIM query for:
               brisbane._domainkey.example.com</t>

            <t>Signature verification starts with the physically last Received
               header field, the From header field, and so forth, in the order
               listed in the "h=" tag. Verification follows with a single CRLF
               followed by the body (starting with "Hi."). The email is
               canonically prepared for verifying with the "simple" method. The
               result of the query and subsequent verification of the signature
               is stored (in this example) in the X-Authentication-Results
               header field line. After successful verification, the email looks

      <section
         title="Usage Examples (INFORMATIVE)">

         <t> DKIM signing and validating can be used in different ways, for
            different operational scenarios. This Appendix discusses some common
            examples. <list>
               <t>NOTE: Descriptions in this Appendix are for informational
                  purposes only. They describe various ways that DKIM can be
                  used, given particular constraints and needs. In no case are
                  these examples intended to be taken as providing explanation
                  or guidance concerning DKIM specification details when
                  creating an implementation.</t>
            </list></t>


         <section
            title="Alternate Submission Scenarios">

            <t>In the most simple scenario, a user's MUA, MSA, and Internet
               (boundary) MTA are all within the same administrative
               environment, using the same domain name. Therefore, all of the
               components involved in submission and initial transfer are
               related. However, it is common for two or more of the components
               to be under independent administrative control. This creates
               challenges for choosing and administering the domain name to use
               for signing and for its relationship to common email identity
               header fields.</t>

            <section
               title="Delegated Business Functions">

               <t>Some organizations assign specific business functions to
                  discrete groups, inside or outside the organization. The goal,
                  then, is to authorize that group to sign some mail but to
                  constrain what signatures they can generate. DKIM selectors
                  (the "s=" signature tag) facilitate this kind of restricted
                  authorization. Examples of these outsourced business functions
                  are legitimate email marketing providers and corporate
                  benefits providers.</t>

               <t>Here, the delegated group needs to be able to send messages
                  that are signed, using the email domain of the client company.
                  At the same time, the client often is reluctant to register a
                  key for the provider that grants the ability to send messages
                  for arbitrary addresses in the domain.</t>

               <t>There are multiple ways to administer these usage scenarios.
                  In one case, the client organization provides all of the
                  public query service (for example, DNS) administration, and in
                  another, it uses DNS delegation to enable all ongoing
                  administration of the DKIM key record by the delegated
                  group.</t>

               <t>If the client organization retains responsibility for all of
                  the DNS administration, the outsourcing company can generate a
                  key pair, supplying the public key to the client company,
                  which then registers it in the query service using a unique
                  selector. The client company retains control over the use of
                  the delegated key because it retains the ability to revoke the
                  key at any time.</t>

               <t>If the client wants the delegated group to do the DNS
                  administration, it can have the domain name that is specified
                  with the selector point to the provider's DNS server. The
                  provider then creates and maintains all of the DKIM signature
                  information for that selector. Hence, the client cannot
                  provide constraints on the local-part of addresses that get
                  signed, but it can revoke the provider's signing rights by
                  removing the DNS delegation record.</t>

            <section
               title="PDAs and Similar Devices">

               <t>PDAs demonstrate the need for using multiple keys per domain.
                  Suppose that John Doe wants to be able to send messages using
                  his corporate email address, jdoe@example.com, and his email
                  device does not have the ability to make a Virtual Private
                  Network (VPN) connection to the corporate network, either
                  because the device is limited or because there are
                  restrictions enforced by his Internet access provider. If the
                  device is equipped with a private key registered for
                  jdoe@example.com by the administrator of the example.com
                  domain and appropriate software to sign messages, John could
                  sign the message on the device itself before transmission
                  through the outgoing network of the access service
                  provider.</t>

            </section>
            <section
               title="Roaming Users">

               <t>Roaming users often find themselves in circumstances where it
                  is convenient or necessary to use an SMTP server other than
                  their home server; examples are conferences and many hotels.
                  In such circumstances, a signature that is added by the
                  submission service will use an identity that is different from
                  the user's home system.</t>

               <t>Ideally, roaming users would connect back to their home server
                  using either a VPN or a SUBMISSION server running with SMTP
                  AUTHentication on port 587. If the signing can be performed on
                  the roaming user's laptop, then they can sign before
                  submission, although the risk of further modification is high.
                  If neither of these are possible, these roaming users will not
                  be able to send mail signed using their own domain key.</t>

            </section>
            <section
               title="Independent (Kiosk) Message Submission">

               <t>Stand-alone services, such as walk-up kiosks and web-based
                  information services, have no enduring email service
                  relationship with the user, but users occasionally request
                  that mail be sent on their behalf. For example, a website
                  providing news often allows the reader to forward a copy of
                  the article to a friend. This is typically done using the
                  reader's own email address, to indicate who the author is.
                  This is sometimes referred to as the "Evite" problem, named
                  after the website of the same name that allows a user to send
                  invitations to friends.</t>

               <t>A common way this is handled is to continue to put the
                  reader's email address in the From header field of the
                  message but put an address owned by the email posting site
                  into the Sender header field. The posting site can then sign
                  the message, using the domain that is in the Sender field.
                  This provides useful information to the receiving email site,
                  which is able to correlate the signing domain with the initial
                  submission email role.</t>

               <t>Receiving sites often wish to provide their end users with
                  information about mail that is mediated in this fashion.
                  Although the real efficacy of different approaches is a
                  subject for human factors usability research, one technique
                  that is used is for the verifying system to rewrite the From
                  header field to indicate the address that was verified, for
                  example: From: John Doe via news@news-site.example
                  &lt;jdoe@example.com&gt;. (Note that such rewriting will break
                  a signature, unless it is done after the verification pass is
                  complete.)</t>
            </section>
         </section>

         <section
            title="Alternate Delivery Scenarios">

            <t>Email is often received at a mailbox that has an address
               different from the one used during initial submission. In these
               cases, an intermediary mechanism operates at the address
               originally used, and it then passes the message on to the final
               destination. This mediation process presents some challenges for
               DKIM signatures.</t>

            <section
               title="Affinity Addresses">

               <t>"Affinity addresses" allow a user to have an email address
                  that remains stable, even as the user moves among different
                  email providers. They are typically associated with college
                  alumni associations, professional organizations, and
                  recreational organizations with which they expect to have a
                  long-term relationship. These domains usually provide
                  forwarding of incoming email, and they often have an
                  associated Web application that authenticates the user and
                  allows the forwarding address to be changed. However, these
                  services usually depend on users sending outgoing messages
                  through their own service provider's MTAs. Hence, mail that is
                  signed with the domain of the affinity address is not signed
                  by an entity that is administered by the organization owning
                  that domain.</t>

               <t>With DKIM, affinity domains could use the Web application to
                  allow users to register per-user keys to be used to sign
                  messages on behalf of their affinity address. The user would
                  take away the secret half of the key pair for signing, and the
                  affinity domain would publish the public half in DNS for
                  access by Verifiers.</t>

               <t>This is another application that takes advantage of user-level
                  keying, and domains used for affinity addresses would
                  typically have a very large number of user-level keys.
                  Alternatively, the affinity domain could handle outgoing mail,
                  operating a mail submission agent that authenticates users
                  before accepting and signing messages for them. This is, of
                  course, dependent on the user's service provider not blocking
                  the relevant TCP ports used for mail submission.</t>

            </section>

            <section
               title="Simple Address Aliasing (.forward)">

               <t>In some cases, a recipient is allowed to configure an email
                  address to cause automatic redirection of email messages from
                  the original address to another, such as through the use of a
                  Unix .forward file. In this case, messages are typically
                  redirected by the mail handling service of the recipient's
                  domain, without modification, except for the addition of a
                  Received header field to the message and a change in the
                  envelope recipient address. In this case, the recipient at the
                  final address' mailbox is likely to be able to verify the
                  original signature since the signed content has not changed,
                  and DKIM is able to validate the message signature.</t>

            </section>

            <section
               title="Mailing Lists and Re-Posters">

               <t>There is a wide range of behaviors in services that take
                  delivery of a message and then resubmit it. A primary example
                  is with mailing lists (collectively called "forwarders"
                  below), ranging from those that make no modification to the
                  message itself, other than to add a Received header field and
                  change the envelope information, to those that add header
                  fields, change the Subject header field, add content to the
                  body (typically at the end), or reformat the body in some
                  manner. The simple ones produce messages that are quite
                  similar to the automated alias services. More elaborate
                  systems essentially create a new message.</t>

               <t>A Forwarder that does not modify the body or signed header
                  fields of a message is likely to maintain the validity of the
                  existing signature. It also could choose to add its own
                  signature to the message.</t>

               <t>Forwarders that modify a message in a way that could make an
                  existing signature invalid are particularly good candidates
                  for adding their own signatures (e.g.,
                  mailing-list-name@example.net). Since (re-)signing is taking
                  responsibility for the content of the message, these signing
                  forwarders are likely to be selective and forward or re-sign
                  a message only if it is received with a valid signature or if
                  they have some other basis for knowing that the message is not
                  spoofed.</t>

               <t>A common practice among systems that are primarily
                  redistributors of mail is to add a Sender header field to the
                  message to identify the address being used to sign the
                  message. This practice will remove any preexisting Sender
                  header field as required by <xref
                     target="RFC5322" />. The forwarder applies a new
                  DKIM-Signature header field with the signature, public key,
                  and related information of the forwarder.</t>

               <artwork><![CDATA[
$ openssl genrsa -out rsa.private 1024]]></artwork>
            </figure></t> <t>For increased security, the "-passin" parameter can also
            be added to encrypt the private key. Use of this parameter will
            require entering a password for several of the following steps.
            Servers may prefer to use hardware cryptographic support.</t>

         <section title="Compatibility with DomainKeys Key Records">
		<t> DKIM key records were designed to be backward compatible
		    in many cases with key records used by DomainKeys
		    <xref target="RFC4870"/> (sometimes referred to
		    as "selector records" in the DomainKeys context).
		    One area of incompatibility warrants particular
		    attention.  The "g=" tag value may be used in
		    DomainKeys and <xref target="RFC4871"/> key records
		    to provide finer granularity of the validity of the
		    key record to a specific local-part.  A null "g=" value
		    in DomainKeys is valid for all addresses in the domain.
		    This differs from the usage in the original DKIM
		    specification (<xref target="RFC4871"/>), where a null
		    "g=" value is not valid for any address.  In particular,
		    see the example public-key record in Section 3.2.3 of
		    <xref target="RFC4870"/>. </t>
         </section>

         <section title="RFC 4871 Compatibility">
		<t> Although the "g=" tag has been deprecated in this
		    version of the DKIM specification (and thus MUST now
		    be ignored), Signers are advised not to include the
		    "g=" tag in key records because some
		    <xref target="RFC4871"/>-compliant Verifiers will be
		    in use for a considerable period to come. </t>
         </section>
      </section>

      <section
         title="MUA Considerations (INFORMATIVE)">

         <t>When a DKIM signature is verified, the processing system sometimes
            makes the result available to the recipient user's MUA. How to
            present this information to users in a way that helps them is a
            matter of continuing human factors usability research. The tendency
            is to have the MUA highlight the SDID, in an attempt to show the
            user the identity that is claiming responsibility for the message.
            An MUA might do this with visual cues such as graphics, might
            include the address in an alternate view, or might even rewrite
            the original From address using the verified information. Some MUAs
            might indicate which header fields were protected by the validated
            DKIM signature. This could be done with a positive indication on the
            signed header fields, with a negative indication on the unsigned
            header fields, by visually hiding the unsigned header fields, or
            some combination of these. If an MUA uses visual indications for
            signed header fields, the MUA probably needs to be careful not to
            display unsigned header fields in a way that might be construed by
            the end user as having been signed. If the message has an "l=" tag
            whose value does not extend to the end of the message, the MUA might
            also hide or mark the portion of the message body that was not
            signed.</t>

         <t>The aforementioned information is not intended to be exhaustive. The
            MUA can choose to highlight, accentuate, hide, or otherwise display
            any other information that may, in the opinion of the MUA author, be
            deemed important to the end user.</t>
