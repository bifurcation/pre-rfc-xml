    <abstract>
       <t>This document outlines an approach utilizing existing IPv6 protocols
      to allow hosts to be assigned a unique IPv6 prefix (instead of a unique
      IPv6 address from a shared IPv6 prefix). Benefits of using a unique IPv6 prefix
	  over a unique service-provider IPv6 address include improved
	  host isolation and enhanced subscriber management on shared network segments.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The concepts in this document were originally developed as part of a
      large-scale production deployment of IPv6 support for a provider-managed shared-access network service.</t>


	  <t>A shared-access network service is a service offering
	  in which a particular Layer 2 (L2) access network (e.g., Wi-Fi) is shared and used by
	  multiple visiting devices (i.e., subscribers).
	  Many service providers offering shared-access network services have legal
	  requirements, or find it good practice, to provide isolation between
	  the connected visitor devices to control potential abuse of the
	  shared-access network.</t>

	  <t>A network implementing a unique IPv6 prefix per host can simply ensure
	  that devices cannot send packets to each
	  other except through the first-hop router. This will automatically
	  provide robust protection against attacks between devices that rely
	  on link-local ICMPv6 packets, such as Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) reply spoofing, Neighbor Discovery (ND) cache
	  exhaustion, malicious redirects, and rogue Router Advertisements (RAs). This form of protection
	  is much more scalable and robust than alternative mechanisms such as
	  DAD proxying, forced forwarding, or ND snooping.</t>

	  <t>In this document IPv6 support does not
      preclude support for IPv4; however, the primary objective for this work
      was to make it so that user equipment (UE) were capable of an IPv6-only
      experience from a network operator's perspective. In the context of this
      document, UE can be 'regular' end-user equipment as well as a server
      in a data center, assuming a shared network (wired or wireless) exists.</t>

      <t>Details of IPv4 support are out of scope for this document. This
      document will also, in general, outline the requirements that must be
      satisfied by UE to allow for an IPv6-only experience.</t>

      <t>In most current deployments, assignment of UE IPv6 addresses
      is commonly done using IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) <xref
      target="RFC4862"></xref> and/or DHCP IA_NA (Identity
	  Association - Non-temporary Address) <xref
      target="RFC3315"></xref>. During the time when this approach was
      developed and subsequently deployed, it was observed that some
      operating systems did not support the use of DHCPv6 for the acquisition
      of IA_NA per <xref target="RFC7934"></xref>. To not exclude any
	  known IPv6 implementations, IPv6-SLAAC-based subscriber and address
	  management is the recommended technology to reach the highest percentage
	  of connected IPv6 devices on a provider-managed shared-access network service.
	  In addition, an IA_NA-only network is not recommended per Section 8 of <xref
      target="RFC7934"></xref>. This document will detail the
      mechanics involved for IPv6-SLAAC-based address and subscriber
      management coupled with stateless DHCPv6, where beneficial.</t>

      <t>This document focuses upon the process for UE to obtain a unique
      IPv6 prefix.</t>

    <section title="Motivation and Scope of Applicability">
      <t>The motivation for this work falls into the following categories:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Give deployment advice for IPv6 that will allow a stable and secure IPv6-only experience, even if IPv4 support is present</t>

          <t>Ensure support for IPv6 is efficient and does not impact the
          performance of the underlying network and, in turn, the customer
          experience</t>

          <t>Allow for the greatest flexibility across host implementations to
          allow for the widest range of addressing and configuration
          mechanisms to be employed. Ensure that the
          widest population of UE implementations can leverage the
          availability of IPv6</t>

          <t>Lay the technological foundation for future work related to the
          use of IPv6 over shared media, requiring optimized subscriber
          management</t>

          <t>Ensure that two devices (subscriber/hosts), both attached to the same
          provider-managed shared-access network, should only be able to communicate
          through the provider-managed first-hop router. Often, service
		  providers have legal requirements, or find it good practice,
		  to provide isolation between the connected visitor devices in order to
		  control potential abuse of the shared-access network.</t>

          <t>Provide guidelines regarding best common practices around IPv6
          ND <xref target="RFC4861"></xref> and IPv6-address-management settings between
          the first-hop router and directly connected hosts/subscribers.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Design Principles">
      <t>The first-hop router discussed in this document is the L3 Edge router
      responsible for the communication with the devices (hosts and
      subscribers) directly connected to a provider-managed shared-access network; it is also
      responsible for transporting traffic between the directly connected devices and
      between directly connected devices and remote devices.</t>

      <t>The work detailed in this document is focused on providing details
      regarding best common practices of the IPv6 ND and
      related IPv6-address-management settings between the first-hop router
      and directly connected hosts/subscribers. The documented best current
      practice helps a service provider to better manage the provider-managed shared-access network on behalf of the connected devices.</t>

      <t>This document recommends providing
      a unique IPv6 prefix to devices connected to the provider-managed shared-access
      network. Each unique IPv6 prefix can function as a control-plane anchor point
	  to make sure that each device receives expected subscriber policy
	  and service levels (throughput, QoS, security, parental control, subscriber-mobility management, etc.).</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Assignment of IPv6 Unique Prefixes">
      <t>When a UE connects to the provider-managed shared-access network, it will initiate the IP configuration phase. During this phase, the
      UE will, from an IPv6 perspective, attempt to learn the default IPv6
      gateway, the IPv6 prefix information, the DNS information
	  <xref target="RFC8106"></xref>, and the remaining information required
      to establish globally routable IPv6 connectivity. For that purpose, the
      subscriber sends an RS (Router Solicitation) message.</t>

      <t>The first-hop router receives this subscriber RS message and
      starts the process of composing the response to the subscriber-originated RS message. The first-hop router will answer
	  using a solicited RA to the subscriber.</t>

	  <t>When the first-hop router sends a solicited RA response, or
	  periodically sends unsolicited RAs, the RA MUST be sent only to the subscriber
	  that has been assigned the unique IPv6 prefix contained in the RA. This is
	  achieved by sending a solicited RA response or unsolicited RAs to the all-nodes
	  group, as detailed in Sections 6.2.4 and 6.2.6 of <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>; but, instead of using the link-layer multicast address associated with the
	  all-nodes group, the link-layer unicast address of the subscriber that has been
	  assigned the unique IPv6 prefix contained in the RA MUST be used as the link-layer
	  destination <xref target="RFC6085"></xref>. Or, optionally in some cases, a
	  solicited RA response could be sent (unicast) to the link-local address of the
	  subscriber as detailed in Section 6.2.6 of <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>;
	  nevertheless, unsolicited RAs are always sent to the all-nodes group.</t>


	  <t>This solicited RA contains
      two important parameters for the subscriber to consume: a unique IPv6
      prefix (currently a /64 prefix)
	  and some flags. The unique IPv6 prefix can be derived from a locally
      managed pool or aggregate IPv6 block assigned to the first-hop
      router or from a centrally allocated pool. The flags indicate that the
      subscriber should use SLAAC and/or DHCPv6 for address assignment; it may
      indicate whether the autoconfigured address is on/off-link and if 'Other'
      information (e.g., DNS server address) needs to be requested.</t>

      <t>The IPv6 RA flags used for best common practice in IPv6-SLAAC-based
      provider-managed shared-access networks are:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>M-flag = 0 (The subscriber address is not managed through DHCPv6);
          this flag may be set to 1 in the future if/when DHCPv6-prefix-delegation support is desired.)</t>

          <t>O-flag = 1 (DHCPv6 is used to request configuration information,
          i.e., DNS, NTP information, not for IPv6 addressing.)</t>

          <t>A-flag = 1 (The subscriber can configure itself using
          SLAAC.)</t>

          <t>L-flag = 0 (The prefix is not an on-link prefix, which means
          that the subscriber will never assume destination addresses
          that match the prefix are on-link and will always send packets
          to those addresses to the appropriate gateway according to
		  route selection rules.)</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The use of a unique IPv6 prefix per subscriber adds an additional level of
      protection and efficiency. The protection exists because all external
	  communication of a connected device is directed
	  to the first-hop router as required by <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>.
	  Best efficiency is achieved because the recommended RA flags allow the broadest
	  support on connected devices to receive a valid IPv6 address (i.e., privacy
	  addresses <xref target="RFC4941"></xref>
	  or SLAAC <xref target="RFC4862"></xref>).</t>

      <t>The architected result of designing the RA as documented above is
      that each subscriber gets its own unique IPv6 prefix. Each host can consequently
      use SLAAC or any other method of choice to select its /128 unique address.
	  Either stateless DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC3736"></xref> or IPv6
	  Router Advertisement Options for DNS Configuration
	  <xref target="RFC8106"></xref> can be used to get the
	  IPv6 address of the DNS server. If the subscriber desires to send
      anything external, including towards other subscriber devices (assuming device-to-device communications is enabled and supported), then, due to the
      L-bit being unset, <xref target="RFC4861"></xref> requires
	  that this traffic be sent to the first-hop router.</t>

      <t>After the subscriber received the RA and the associated flags,
      it will assign itself a 128-bit IPv6 address using SLAAC. Since the
      address is composed by the subscriber device itself, it will need to
      verify that the address is unique on the shared network. The
      subscriber will, for that purpose, perform the DAD
      algorithm. This will occur for each address the UE attempts to utilize
      on the provider-managed shared-access network.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Best Practices for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery">
      <t>An operational consideration when using IPv6-address assignment with
      IPv6 SLAAC is that after the onboarding procedure, the subscriber will
      have a prefix with certain preferred and valid lifetimes. The first-hop
      router extends these lifetimes by sending an unsolicited RA,
      the applicable MaxRtrAdvInterval on the first-hop router MUST, therefore,
      be lower than the preferred lifetime. One consequence of this process
      is that the first-hop router never knows when a subscriber stops
      using addresses from a prefix, and additional procedures are required to
      help the first-hop router to gain this information. When using stateful
      DHCPv6 IA_NA for IPv6-subscriber-address assignment, this uncertainty
      on the first-hop router does not have an impact due to the stateful nature of
      the assignment of DHCPv6 IA_NA addresses.</t>

      <t>The following is a reference table of the key IPv6 router and
      neighbor discovery timers for provider-managed shared-access networks:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Maximum IPv6 Router Advertisement Interval (MaxRtrAdvInterval) = 300 s
		  (or when battery consumption is a concern 686 s, see note below)</t>

          <t>IPv6 Router Lifetime = 3600 s (see note below)</t>

          <t>Reachable time = 30 s</t>

          <t>IPv6 Valid Lifetime = 3600 s</t>

          <t>IPv6 Preferred Lifetime = 1800 s</t>

          <t>Retransmit timer = 0 s</t>
        </list></t>

		<t>Note: When servicing large numbers of battery powered devices, <xref
      target="RFC7772"></xref> suggests a maximum of seven RAs per hour and
	  a 45-90 minute IPv6 Router Lifetime. To achieve a maximum of seven RAs per hour,
	  the Minimum IPv6 Router Advertisement Interval (MinRtrAdvInterval) is the
	  important parameter, and it MUST be greater than or equal to 514 seconds (1/7 of
	  an hour). Further, as discussed in Section 6.2.1. of <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>,
	   MinRtrAdvInterval
	  &lt;=0.75 * MaxRtrAdvInterval; therefore, MaxRtrAdvInterval MUST additionally
	  be greater than or equal to 686 seconds. As for the recommended IPv6 Router
	  Lifetime, since this technique requires that RAs be sent using the link-layer
	  unicast address of the subscriber, the concerns over multicast delivery
	  discussed in <xref target="RFC7772"></xref> are already mitigated;
	  therefore, the above suggestion of 3600 seconds (an hour) seems sufficient
	  for this use case.</t>

	  <t>IPv6 SLAAC requires the router to maintain neighbor state, which implies
		  costs in terms of memory, power, message exchanges, and message processing.
		  Stale entries can prove an unnecessary burden, especially on Wi-Fi interfaces.
		  It is RECOMMENDED that stale neighbor state be removed quickly.</t>

      <t>When employing stateless IPv6 address assignment, a number of widely
      deployed operating systems will attempt to utilize <xref target="RFC4941"></xref>
	  temporary 'private' addresses.</t>

      <t>Similarly, when using this technology in a data center, the UE server
      may need to use several addresses from the same unique IPv6 prefix, for example, because
      is using multiple virtual hosts, containers, etc., in the bridged-virtual
      switch. This can lead to the consequence that a UE has multiple /128
      addresses from the same IPv6 prefix. The first-hop router MUST
      be able to handle the presence and use of multiple globally routable
      IPv6 addresses.</t>

    <section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
<t>This document does not require any IANA actions.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

	  <t>The mechanics of IPv6 privacy extensions <xref target="RFC4941"></xref>
	  are compatible with assignment of a unique IPv6 prefix per host.
	  However, when combining both IPv6 privacy extensions and a unique IPv6 prefix per host,
	  a reduced privacy experience for the subscriber is introduced.  This is because a
	  prefix may be associated with a subscriber, even when the subscriber has implemented IPv6 privacy extensions <xref target="RFC4941"></xref>.
    If the operator assigns the same unique prefix to the same link-layer
    address every time a host connects, any remote party who is aware of
    this fact can easily track a host simply by tracking its assigned prefix.
    This nullifies the benefit provided by privacy addresses
    <xref target="RFC4941"></xref>. 
    If a host wishes to maintain privacy on such networks, it SHOULD
    ensure that its link-layer address is periodically changed or randomized.
    </t>

      <t>No other additional security considerations are made in this document.</t>
