      <t>
        The specification for enhanced mail system status codes, RFC
        3463, establishes a new code model and lists a collection of
	status codes.  While it anticipated that more codes would be added
	over time, it did not provide an explicit mechanism for
	registering and tracking those codes.  This document
	specifies an IANA registry for mail system enhanced status
	codes, and initializes that registry with the codes so far
	established in published standards-track documents, as well
	as other codes that have become established in the industry.
      </t>
    </abstract>

    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>
        Enhanced Status Codes for SMTP were first defined in <xref target='RFC1893' />, which was
        subsequently replaced by <xref target='RFC3463'/>.
        While it anticipated that more codes would be added
        over time (see section 2 of <xref target='RFC3463'/>), it did not provide an
        explicit mechanism for registering and tracking those codes.  
        Since then, various RFCs have been published and internet drafts proposed
        that define additional status codes.
        However, without an IANA registry, conflicts in definitions have begun to appear.
      </t>
      <t>
        This RFC defines such an IANA registry and was written to help prevent further
        conflicts from appearing in the future.
        It initializes the registry with the established standards-track enhanced status codes
        from <xref target='RFC3463'/>, <xref target='RFC3886'/>, <xref target='RFC4468'/>, and <xref target='RFC4954'/>.
        In addition, this document adds several codes to the registry that were established by various internet drafts
        and have come into common use, despite the expiration of the documents themselves.
      </t>
      <t>
        As specified in <xref target="RFC3463"/>, an enhanced status code consists of
	a three-part code, with each part being numeric and separated by a period character.
	The three portions are known as the class sub-code, the subject sub-code, and the detail sub-code.
	In the tables, a wildcard for the class sub-code is represented by an X,
	a wildcard for a subject sub-code is represented by an XXX,
	and a wildcard for a detail sub-code is represented by a YYY.
	For example, 3.XXX.YYY has an unspecified subject sub-code and an unspecified status code, and
	X.5.0 is has an unspecified class sub-code.
	(This is a change from <xref target="RFC3463"/>, which uses XXX for both the subject sub-code
	and detail sub-code wildcards.)
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='IANA Considerations'>
      <section title='SMTP Enhanced Status Codes Registry'>
        <t>
          IANA has created the registry "SMTP Enhanced Status Codes".
          The SMTP Enhanced Status Codes registry will have three tables:
	  <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>
              Class Sub-Codes
	      <vspace blankLines="0" />
	      Each of the entries in this table represent class sub-codes and all
	      have an unspecified subject sub-code and an unspecified detail sub-code.
            </t>
            <t>
	      Subject Sub-Codes
	      <vspace blankLines="0" />
	      Each of the entries in this table represent subject sub-codes and all
	      have an unspecified class sub-code and an unspecified detail sub-code.
            </t>
            <t>
	      Enumerated Status Codes
	      <vspace blankLines="0" />
	      Each of the entries in this table represent the combination of a subject
	      sub-code and a detail sub-code.
	      All entries will have an unspecified class sub-code,
	      a specified subject sub-code, and a specified detail sub-code.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          Each entry in the tables will include the following.
	  (The sub-code tables will not have the Associated Basic Status Code entries.)
	  <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          <list style="hanging" hangIndent="30">
            <t hangText="Code:">The status code.
	      For example, 3.XXX.YYY is a class sub-code with an unspecified subject
	      sub-code and an unspecified detail sub-code, and

	      NOTE: This is a non-exclusive list.
	      In particular, the entries that list some basic status codes for an
	      Enhanced Status Code might allow for other basic status codes,
	      while the entries denoted "Not given" can be filled in by updating the IANA registry
	      through updates to this document or at the direction of the IESG.

      <section title="Review Process for New Values">
        <t>
          Entries in this registry are expected to follow
          the "Specification Required" model (<xref target='RFC5226'/>) although, in practice,
          most entries are expected to derive from standards-track documents.
	  Non-standards-track documents that specify codes to be
	  registered should be readily available. The principal purpose of this
	  registry is to avoid confusion and conflicts among different 
	  definitions or uses for the same code.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Registration Updates">
        <t>
          Standards-track registrations may be updated if the relevant
	  standards are updated as a consequence of
          that action.
          Non-standards-track entries may be updated by the listed change controller.
	  Only the entry's short description or references may be
	  modified in this way, not the code or 
          associated text.
 	  In exceptional cases, any aspect of any registered entity
	  may be updated at the direction of the 
          IESG (for example, to correct a conflict).
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Initial Values">
        <t>
          The initial values for the class and subject sub-code tables
	  are to be populated from section 2 of <xref target='RFC3463'/>.
          Specifically, these are the values for 2.XXX.YYY, 4.XXX.YYY,
	  and 5.XXX.YYY for the Class Sub-Code table, 
          and the values X.0.YYY, X.1.YYY, X.2.YYY, X.3.YYY, X.4.YYY,
	  X.5.YYY, X.6.YYY, and X.7.YYY for the Subject Sub-Code table. 
  	  The code, sample text, and description for each entry are to
	  be taken from <xref target='RFC3463'/>.
          Each entry is to use <xref target='RFC3463'/> as the
	  reference, submitted by G. Vaudreuil, and change controlled by the IESG.
	  There are no associated detail sub-code values for the class
	  and subject sub-code tables.
        </t>

        <t>
          The initial values for the Enumerated Status Code table is to be populated from:
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>
              sections 3.1 through 3.8 of <xref target='RFC3463'/>,

              X.5.0 through X.5.5, X.6.0 through X.6.5, and X.7.0 through X.7.7),
            </t>
            <t>
              section 3.3.4 of <xref target='RFC3886'/> (X.1.9),
            </t>
            <t>
              X.6.6 found in section 5 of <xref target='RFC4468'/>,
	      (but not X.7.8 found in the same section),
            </t>
            <t>
              and X.5.6, X.7.8, X.7.9, X.7.11, and X.7.12, found in section 6 of <xref target='RFC4954'/>
	      (using the text from X.5.6, 5.7.8, 5.7.9, 5.7.11, and 4.7.12).
            </t>
          </list>
	</t>
	<t>
          Each entry is to be designated as defined in the corresponding RFC,
	  submitted by the corresponding RFC author, and
	  change controlled by the IESG.
	  Each of the above RFCs is a standards-track document.
         </t>
         <t>
          The initial values for the Associated Basic Status Code for each of
	  the above initial enhanced status codes is given in the following table.
         </t>
	 <t>
	   As noted above, this table is incomplete.
	   In particular, the entries that have some basic status codes might allow for other detail sub-status codes,
	   while the entries denoted "Not given" can be filled in by updating the IANA registry
	   through updates to this document or at the direction of the IESG.

		It differs from a generic authentication failure where the client's
		best option is to present the passphrase entry dialog in case the
		user simply mistyped their passphrase.

              The submission server requires a configured trust relationship
              with a third-party server in order to access the message content.
              This value replaces the prior use of X.7.8 for this
              error condition, thereby updating <xref target='RFC4468'/>.

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
       As stated in <xref target='RFC1893'/>, use of enhanced status codes may disclose additional
       information about how an internal mail system is implemented beyond
       that available through the SMTP status codes.
      </t>
      <t>
        Many proposed additions to the response code list are security related.
        Having these registered in one place to prevent collisions will improve their value.
        Security error responses can leak information to active attackers (e.g.,
        the distinction between "user not found" and "bad password" during authentication).
        Documents defining security error codes should make it clear when this is the case so SMTP
        server software subject to such threats can provide
        appropriate controls to restrict exposure.

    <section title='Acknowledgements'>
      <t>
        While the need for this registry should have become clear shortly after
	<xref target='RFC3463'/> was approved, the growth of the code table
	through additional documents and work done as part of email
	internationalization and <xref target='RFC2821'/> updating efforts made
        the requirement much more clear.
	The comments of the participants in those efforts are gratefully acknowledged,
	particularly the members of the ietf-smtp@imc.org mailing list.
        Chris Newman and Randy Gellens provided useful comments and
        some text for early versions of the document.
