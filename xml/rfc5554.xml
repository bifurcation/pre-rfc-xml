        <abstract><t>This document clarifies and generalizes the Generic
                Security Service Application Programming Interface
                (GSS-API) "channel bindings" facility, and imposes
                requirements on future GSS-API mechanisms and
                programming language bindings of the GSS-API.</t>

	<section title="Introduction">
            <t>The base GSS-API version 2, update 1 specification <xref
                    target="RFC2743"/> provides a facility for channel
		binding (see also <xref target="RFC5056"/>), but its
		treatment is incomplete.  
                The GSS-API C-bindings specification [RFC2744] expands
                    somewhat on this facility in what should be a
                    generic way, but is instead a C-specific way, thus
                    leaving the treatment of this facility incomplete.</t>



	    <t>This document clarifies the GSS-API's channel binding
		facility and generalizes the parts of it that are
		specified in the C-bindings document but that should
		have been generic from the start.</t>
	</section>
       
        <section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
            <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
            "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
            and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
            described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="New Requirements for GSS-API Mechanisms">
            <t>Given the publication of RFC 5056, we now assert that
                all new GSS-API mechanisms that support channel binding
                MUST conform to <xref target="RFC5056"/>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Generic Structure for GSS-API Channel Bindings">
            <t>The base GSS-API version 2, update 1 specification <xref
                    target="RFC2743"/> provides a facility for channel
                binding.  It models channel bindings as an OCTET STRING
                and leaves it to the GSS-API version 2, update 1 C-bindings
                specification to specify the structure of the contents
                of the channel bindings OCTET STRINGs.  The C-bindings
                specification <xref target="RFC2744"/> then defines, in
                terms of C, what should have been a generic structure
                for channel bindings.  The Kerberos V GSS mechanism
                <xref target="RFC4121"/> also defines a method for
                encoding GSS channel bindings in a way that is
                independent of the C-bindings -- otherwise, the
                mechanism's channel binding facility would not be
                useable with other language bindings.</t>

   <t>In other words, the structure of GSS channel bindings given in
   <xref target="RFC2744"/> is actually generic in spite of being
   specified in terms of C concepts and syntax.</t>


	    <t>We generalize it as shown below, using the same
		pseudo-ASN.1 as is used in RFC 2743.  Although the figure
		below is, indeed, a valid ASN.1 <xref
		    target="CCITT.X680"/> type, we do not provide a
		full ASN.1 module as none is needed because no standard
		encoding of this structure is needed -- the definition
		below is part of an abstract API, not part of a protocol
		defining bits on the wire.  GSS-API mechanisms do need
		to encode the contents of this structure, but that
		encoding will be mechanism specific (see below).</t>

            <figure title="Abstract GSS-API Channel Bindings Structure">
                <artwork><![CDATA[
   GSS-CHANNEL-BINDINGS ::= SEQUENCE {
           initiator-address-type  INTEGER,      -- See RFC2744
           initiator-address       OCTET STRING, -- See RFC2744
           acceptor-address-type   INTEGER,      -- See RFC2744
           acceptor-address        OCTET STRING, -- See RFC2744
           application-data        OCTET STRING -- See RFC5056
   }
                ]]></artwork>
            </figure>

            <t>The values for the address fields are described in <xref
                    target="RFC2744"/>.</t>

            <t>New language-specific bindings of the GSS-API SHOULD
                specify a language-specific formulation of this
                structure.</t>

	    <t>Where a language binding of the GSS-API models channel
		bindings as OCTET STRINGs (or the language's
		equivalent), then the implementation MUST assume that
		the given bindings correspond only to the
		application-data field of GSS-CHANNEL-BINDINGS as shown
		above, rather than some encoding of
		GSS-CHANNEL-BINDINGS.</t>

	    <t>As mentioned above, <xref target="RFC4121"/> describes an
		encoding of the above GSS-CHANNEL-BINDINGS structure
		and then hashes that encoding.  Other GSS-API mechanisms
		are free to use that encoding.</t>

        <section title="Security Considerations">
            <t>For general security considerations relating to channel
                bindings, see <xref target="RFC5056"/>.</t>
            <t>Language bindings that use OCTET STRING (or equivalent)
                for channel bindings will not support the use of network
                addresses as channel bindings.  This should not cause
                any security problems, as the use of network addresses
                as channel bindings is not generally secure.  However,
                it is important that "end-point channel bindings" not be
                modeled as network addresses; otherwise, such channel
                bindings may not be useable with all language bindings
                of the GSS-API.</t>
