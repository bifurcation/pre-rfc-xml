  Many of the requirements for the services provided by the mechanisms
  explained in this document are also recognized by the MPLS transport
  profile (MPLS-TP) design effort formed jointly by the IETF and ITU-T
  <xref target="RFC5654"></xref>. For example, the ability to operate
  solely with network management control, the ability to use
  Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) that does not rely on
  IP forwarding, and the ability to provide light-weight proactive
  connection verification (CV) functionality.
</t><t>
  The solution described in this document does not address all of the
  MPLS-TP requirements, but it provides a viable form of packet
  transport service using tools that are already available.
</t><t>
  The key purpose of this document is to demonstrate that there is an
  existing IETF mechanism with known implementations that satisfies the
  requirements posed by the operator community.  It is recognized that
  it is possible to design a more efficient method of satisfying the
  requirements, and the IETF anticipates that improved solutions will
  be proposed in the future as part of the MPLS-TP effort. Indeed, the
  solution described in this document is not intended to detract from
  the MPLS-TP effort. Instead, it provides legitimacy for that work by
  showing that there is a real demand from networks that are already
  deployed, and by indicating that the MPLS-TP solutions work is based
  on sound foundations.

      <t></t>

      <t>An 802.3 (Ethernet) circuit is established between CE1 and CE2. This
      circuit may be used for the concurrent transport of MPLS packets as well
      as IPv4 and IPv6 packets. The MPLS packets may carry IPv4, IPV6, or
      pseudowire payloads, and Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP) may be used. For
      clarity, these paths are labeled as the client in Figure 1.</t>

      <t>An Ethernet pseudowire (PW) is provisioned between PE1 and PE2 and is
      used to carry the Ethernet from PE1 to PE2. The Ethernet PW is carried
      over an MPLS Packet Switched Network (PSN), but this PSN MUST NOT be
      configured with PHP. For clarity, this Ethernet PW and the MPLS PSN are
      labeled as the server in Figure 1. In the remainder of this document, call
      the server network a transport network.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

    <section title="PWE3 Configuration ">
      <t>The PWE3 encapsulation used by this specification to satisfy the
      transport requirement is Ethernet <xref target="RFC4448"></xref>. This
      is used in "raw" mode.</t>

      <t>The Control Word MUST be used. The sequence number MUST be zero.</t>

      <t>The use of the Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance Label Distribution
      Protocol <xref target="RFC4447"></xref> is not required by the profile
      of the PWE3 Ethernet pseudowire functionality defined in this
      document.</t>

      <t>The pseudowire label is statically provisioned.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)">

      <t>Within a connection, traffic units sent from the single source are
      constrained to stay within the connection under defect-free conditions.
      During misconnected defects, a connection can no longer be assumed to be
      constrained, and traffic units (and by implication also OAM packets) can
      'leak' unidirectionally outside a connection. Therefore, during a
      misconnected state, it is not possible to rely on OAM, which relies on a
      request/response mechanism, and, for this reason, such OAM should be
      treated with caution if used for diagnostic purposes.</t>

      <t>Further, when implementing an Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) function
      with MPLS, use of the label stack as the path selector such that the OAM
      and data are not in a co-path SHOULD be avoided, as any failure in the
      data path will not be reflected in the OAM path. Therefore, an OAM that
      is carried within the data-path below the PW label (such as Virtual
      Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV)) is NOT vulnerable to the above
      failure mode. For these reasons, the OAM mechanism is as described in <xref
      target="RFC5085"></xref>, which uses Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
      <xref target="RFC5880"></xref> for connection verification
      (CV). The method of using BFD as a CV method in VCCV is described in <xref
      target="RFC5885"></xref>. One of the VCCV profiles
      described in Section 3.1 or Section 3.2 MUST be used. Once a VCCV
      control channel is provisioned and the operational status of the PW is
      UP, no other profile should be used until such time as the PW's
      operational status is set to DOWN.</t>

      <section title="VCCV Profile 1: BFD without IP/UDP Headers">
        <t>When PE1 and PE2 are not IP capable or have not been configured
        with IP addresses, the following VCCV mechanism SHOULD be used.</t>

        <t>The connection verification method used by VCCV is BFD with
        diagnostics as defined in <xref

        <t>The Version and the Reserved fields are set to zero, and the
        Channel Type is set to 0x7 to indicate that the payload carried is BFD

    <section title="MPLS Layer  ">
      <t>The architecture of MPLS-enabled networks is described in <xref
      target="RFC3031"></xref>. This section describes a subset of the
      functionality of the MPLS-enabled PSN. There are two cases that need to
      be considered: <list style="numbers">
          <t>The case where external configuration is used.</t>

          <t>The case where a control plane is available.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Where the use of a control plane is desired, this may be based on
      Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) <xref
      target="RFC3945"> </xref>.</t>

      <section title="External Configuration  ">
        <t>The use of external provisioning is not precluded from being
        supported by the current MPLS specifications. It is however explicitly
        described in this specification to address the requirements specified
        by the ITU <xref target="RFC5654"></xref> to
        address the needs in a transport environment.</t>

        <t>The MPLS encapsulation is specified in <xref target="RFC3032">
        </xref>. All MPLS labels used in the server layer (Figure 1) MUST be
        statically provisioned. Labels may be selected from either the
        per-platform or the per-interface label space.</t>

        <t>All transport Label Switched Paths (LSPs) utilized by the PWs
        described in Section 2 MUST support both unidirectional and
        bidirectional point-to-point connections.</t>

        <t>The transport LSPs SHOULD support unidirectional
        point-to-multipoint connections.</t>

        <t>The forward and backward directions of a bidirectional connection
        SHOULD follow a symmetrically routed (reciprocal) LSP in the server
        network.</t>

        <t>Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) load balancing MUST NOT be configured
        on the transport LSPs utilized by the PWs described in Section 2.</t>

        <t>The merging of Label Switched Paths is prohibited and MUST NOT be
        configured for the transport LSPs utilized by the PWs described in
        Section 2.</t>

        <t>Penultimate hop popping by the transport Label Switched Routers
        (LSRs) MUST be disabled on transport LSPs.</t>

        <t>Both EXP-Inferred-PSC LSPs (E-LSP) and Label-Only-Inferred-PSC LSPs
        (L-LSP) MUST be supported as defined in <xref
        target="RFC3270"></xref>.</t>

        <t>For the MPLS EXP field <xref target="RFC3270"></xref> <xref
        target="RFC5462"></xref>, only the pipe and short-pipe models are
        supported.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Control Plane Configuration ">
        <t>In this section, we describe the control plane configuration
        when <xref target="RFC3209"> </xref> or the bidirectional support in GMPLS
(<xref target="RFC3471"> </xref> and <xref target="RFC3473"></xref>)
are used to configure the transport MPLS PSN. When these protocols are used to
provide the control plane, the following are automatically provided:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>There is no label merging unless it is deliberately enabled to
            support Fast Re-route (FRR) <xref target="RFC3209"></xref>.</t>

            <t>A single path is provided end-to-end (there is no ECMP).</t>

            <t>Label Switched Paths may be unidirectional or bidirectional as
            required.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Additionally, the following configuration restrictions required to
        support external configuration MUST be applied:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Penultimate hop popping <xref target="RFC3031"> </xref> by the

               functionality.  
            </t>

            <t>Both E-LSP and L-LSP MUST be supported as defined in <xref
            target="RFC3270"></xref>.</t>

            <t>The MPLS EXP <xref target="RFC5462"></xref> field is supported
            according to <xref target="RFC3270"></xref> only when the pipe
            and short-pipe models are utilized.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Congestion Considerations ">
      <t>This document describes a method of using the existing PWE3 Ethernet
      pseudowire <xref target="RFC4448"></xref> to solve a particular network
      application. The congestion considerations associated with that
      pseudowire and all subsequent work on congestion considerations
      regarding Ethernet pseudowires are applicable to this RFC.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This RFC provides a description of the use of existing IETF Proposed
      Standards to solve a network problem, and raises no new security
      issues.</t>

      <t>The PWE3 security considerations are described in <xref
      target="RFC3985"></xref> and the Ethernet pseudowire security
      considerations of <xref target="RFC4448"> </xref>.</t>

      <t>The Ethernet pseudowire is transported on an MPLS PSN; therefore, the
      security of the pseudowire itself will only be as good as the security
      of the MPLS PSN. The server MPLS PSN can be secured by various methods,
      as described in <xref target="RFC3031"> </xref>.</t>

      <t>The use of static configuration exposes an MPLS PSN to a different
      set of security risks to those found in a PSN using dynamic routing. If
      a path is misconfigured in a statically configured network, the result
      can be a persistent black hole, or much worse, a persistent forwarding
      loop. On the other hand, most of the distributed components are less
      complex. This is however offset by the need to provide fail-over and
      redundancy in the management and configuration system and the
      communications paths between those central systems and the LSRs.</t>

      <t>Security achieved by access control of media access control (MAC)
      addresses, and the security of the client layers, is out of the scope of
      this document.</t>
