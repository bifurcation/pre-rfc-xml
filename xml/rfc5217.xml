                        The objective of this document is to establish a terminology framework and to suggest the operational requirements of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) domain for interoperability of multi-domain Public Key Infrastructure, where each PKI domain is operated under a distinct policy.
                        This document describes the relationships between Certification Authorities (CAs), provides the definition and requirements for PKI domains, and discusses typical models of multi-domain PKI.

                                The objective of this document is to establish a terminology framework and to provide the operational requirements, which can be used by different Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authorities who are considering establishing trust relationships with each other.
                                The document defines different types of possible trust relationships, identifies design and implementation considerations that PKIs should implement to facilitate trust relationships across PKIs, and identifies issues that should be considered when implementing trust relationships.
                                
                                This document defines terminology and interoperability requirements for multi-domain PKIs from one perspective. A PKI domain can achieve multi-domain PKI interoperability by complying with the requirements in this document. However, there are other ways to define and realize multi-domain PKI interoperability.

                                In the case where one CA issues unilateral cross-certificates to other CAs, the CA issuing unilateral cross-certificates is called a Unifying CA.
                                Unifying CAs use only unilateral cross-certificates.

                                Relying Parties may use a Trust List for establishing trust relationships to one or more PKIs.
                                A Trust List is a set of one or more trust anchors for trusting one or more PKIs.

                        For these relationships, each PKI retains its own set of Certificate Policy OIDs and its own Principal CA.
                        In addition to making a business decision to consider a trust relationship, each PKI determines the level of trust of each external PKI by reviewing external PKI Certificate Policy Document(s) and any other PKI governance documentation through a process known as policy mapping.
                        Trust relationships are technically formalized through the issuance of cross-certificates.
                        Such a collection of two or more PKIs is known as a PKI domain.

                                        To prevent creating inadvertent trust relationships across PKI domains when a single PKI is a member of two or more disparate PKI domains, each PKI domain must be cognizant of what PKI domains in which its member PKIs participate.

                                        As shown in <xref target='fig_participation' />, PKI2 is a member of both PKI domain 1 and PKI domain 2.
                                        Since a certification path exists from PKI1 to PKI2, and from PKI2 to PKI3, a certification path also exists from PKI1 to PKI3.
                                        However, PKI1 does not share domain membership with PKI3, so the certification path validation from PKI1 to PKI3 with a validation policy for PKI domain 1 must not succeed.  To ensure correct certification path validation and policy mapping, the cross-certificates issued by both PKI1 and PKI3 to PKI2 must contain constraints such as policy mapping or name constraints disallowing the validation of certification paths outside their respective domains.

                                        To fully prevent inadvertent trust, any PKI that is a member of one or more PKI domains must inform all those PKI domains of its membership in all other PKI domains.
                                        In addition, that PKI must inform all those PKI domains of which it is a member, any time its membership status changes with regards to any other PKI domain.
                                        If a PKI domain is informed of the change in status of one of its member PKIs with regards to other PKI domains, that PKI domain must review the constraints in any cross-certificate issued to that PKI.
                                        If the change in membership would result in a change to the allowed or disallowed certification paths, the PKI domain must ensure that all such cross-certificates are revoked and re-issued with correct constraints.

                                Two or more PKI domains may choose to enter into trust relationships with each other.

                                        In the Unifying Trust Point Model, a PKI domain is created by establishing a joint, superior CA that issues unilateral cross-certificates to each PKI domain, as shown in <xref target='fig_unifying_model' />.
                                        Such a joint, superior CA is defined as a Unifying CA, and the Principal CAs in each PKI domain have the hierarchical CA relationship with that Unifying CA.
                                        In this model, any relying party from any of the PKI domains must specify the Unifying CA as its trust anchor CA in order to validate a subscriber in the other PKI domains.
                                        If the relying party does not desire to validate subscribers in other PKI domains, the relying party may continue to use the Principal CA from the old PKI domain as its trust anchor CA.

                                        The unilateral cross-certificate issued by the Unifying CA to the Principal CAs in each PKI domain may include any policy mapping.

                                Each PKI domain may use policy mapping for crossing different PKI domains.
                                If a PKI domain wants to restrict a certification path, the PKI domain should not rely on the validation policy of the relying party, but should include the constraints in the cross-certificate explicitly.

                        <t>
                                For example, when each PKI domain wants to affect the constraints to a certification path, it should set the requireExplicitPolicy to zero in the policyConstraints extension of any cross-certificates.
                                A PKI domain that relies on the validation policy of the relying party about such constraints cannot guarantee the constraints will be recognized and followed.

                                        Creating a Local Trust List is the simplest method for relying parties to trust EE certificates.
                                        Using Local Trust Lists does not require cross-certification between the PKI that issued the relying party's own certificate and the PKI that issued the EE's certificate,nor does it require implementing mechanisms for processing complex certification paths, as all CAs in a path can be included in the Local Trust List.
                                        As a result, Local Trust Lists are the most common model in use today.  However, because Local Trust Lists are created and managed independently by each relying party, the use of Local Trust Lists can be difficult for an enterprise to manage.

                                        A Trust Authority may be operated by a PKI, a collection of relying parties that share a common set of users, an enterprise on behalf of all of its relying parties, or an independent entity.
                                        Although PKIs generally establish trust relationships through cross-certificates, a PKI may choose to provide a Trust Authority to support relying parties that do not support processing of certification paths.
                                        A collection of relying parties that share a common set of users may choose to maintain a single Trust Authority to simplify the management of Trust Lists.
                                        An enterprise may choose to provide a Trust Authority to implement enterprise policies and direct all Relying Parties within the enterprise to use its Trust Authority.
                                        Finally, an independent entity may choose to operate a Trust Authority as a managed service.

                        This section highlights security considerations related to establishing PKI domains.
                </t>

                <section title="PKI Domain Models">
                        <t>
                                For all PKI domain models described in
                                <xref target="pkiDomainModels" /> created through the issuance of cross-certificates, standard threats including message insertion, modification, and man-in-the-middle are not applicable because all information created by CAs, including policy mapping and constraints, is digitally signed by the CA generating the cross-certificate.
                        </t>

                        <t>
                                Verifying that a given certificate was issued by a member of a PKI domain may be a time-critical determination.
                                If cross-certificates and revocation status information cannot be obtained in a timely manner, a denial of service may be experienced by the end entity.
                                In situations where such verification is critical, caching of cross-certificates and revocation status information may be warranted.
                        </t>

                        <t>
                                An additional security consideration for PKI domains is creating inadvertent trust relationships, which can occur if a single PKI is a member of multiple PKI domains.
                                See
                                <xref
                                target="pkiDomainMembershipNotification"
                                /> for a discussion of creating inadvertent trust relationships and mechanisms to prevent it.
                        </t>

                        <t>
                                Finally, members of PKI domains must participate in domain governance, or at a minimum, be informed anytime a PKI joins or leaves the domain, so that domain members can make appropriate decisions for maintaining their own membership in the domain or choosing to restrict or deny trust in the new member PKI.
                        </t>
                </section>

                <section title="Trust List Models">
                        <t>
                                In these models, many standard attacks are not applicable since certificates are digitally signed.
                                Additional security considerations apply when trust is created through a Trust List.
                        </t>

                        <t>
                                A variation of the modification attack is possible in Trust List Models.
                                If an attacker is able to add or remove CAs from the relying party or Trust Authority Trust List, the attacker can affect which certificates will or will not be accepted.
                                To prevent this attack, access to Trust Lists must be adequately protected against unauthorized modification.
                                This protection is especially important for trust anchors that are used by multiple applications, as it is a key vulnerability of this model.
                                This attack may result in unauthorized usage if a CA is added to a Trust List, or denial of service if a CA is removed from a Trust List.
                        </t>

                        <t>
                                For Trust Authority models, a denial-of-service attack is also possible if the application cannot obtain timely information from the trust anchor.
                                Applications should specify service-level agreements with Trust Authority.
                                In addition, applications may choose to locally cache the list of CAs maintained by the Trust Authority as a backup in the event that the trust anchor's repository (e.g., Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory) is not available.
