<abstract>

<t>This document replaces "Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation
Requirements and Usage Guidance for Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication
Header (AH)". The goal of this document is to enable ESP and AH to benefit from cryptography 
that is up to date while making IPsec interoperable.</t>

<t>This document obsoletes RFC 7321.</t>

<section title="Introduction">

     <t>The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) <xref target="RFC4303"/> and
     the Authentication Header (AH) <xref target="RFC4302"/> are the
     mechanisms for applying cryptographic protection to data being sent over
     an IPsec Security Association (SA) <xref target="RFC4301"/>.</t>

     <t>This document provides guidance and recommendations so that ESP and
     AH can be used with a cryptographic algorithms that are up to date.
     The challenge of such documents is making sure that, over time, 
     IPsec implementations can use secure and up-to-date cryptographic
     algorithms while keeping IPsec interoperable.</t>

     <section title="Updating Algorithm Implementation Requirements and Usage Guidance">
      <t> The field of cryptography evolves continuously: new, stronger
      algorithms appear, and existing algorithms are found to be less
      secure than originally thought. Therefore, algorithm
      implementation requirements and usage guidance need to be
      updated from time to time to reflect the new reality. The
      choices for algorithms must be conservative to minimize the risk
      of algorithm compromise. Algorithms need to be suitable for a
      wide variety of CPU architectures and device deployments ranging
      from high-end bulk encryption devices to small, low-power Internet of
      Things (IoT)
      devices.</t>

      <t> The algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidance
      may need to change over time to adapt to the changing world. For
      this reason, the selection of mandatory-to-implement algorithms
      was removed from the main Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) specification and placed in a
      separate document.</t>

<!--[rfced] For the ease of the reader, should a citation be added here?

     </section>


     <section title="Updating Algorithm Requirement Levels">
      <t>The mandatory-to-implement algorithm of tomorrow should
      already be available in most implementations of AH/ESP by the time
      it is made mandatory. This document attempts to identify and
      introduce those algorithms for future mandatory-to-implement
      status. There is no guarantee that the algorithms in use today
      may become mandatory in the future. Published algorithms are
      continuously subjected to cryptographic attack and may become
      too weak or could become completely broken before this document
      is updated.</t>

      <t> This document only provides recommendations for the
      mandatory-to-implement algorithms and "too weak" algorithms that
      are recommended not to be implemented. As a result, any algorithm
      listed at the IPsec IANA registry that is not mentioned in this document
      MAY be implemented. It is expected that this document will be
      updated over time and future versions will only mention algorithms
      that have evolved in status. For clarification, when an algorithm has
      been mentioned in <xref target="RFC7321"/>, this document states
      explicitly the update of the status.</t>

      <t> Although this document updates the algorithms to keep the
      AH/ESP communication secure over time, it also aims at providing
      recommendations so that AH/ESP implementations remain
      interoperable. AH/ESP interoperability is addressed by an
      incremental introduction or deprecation of algorithms. In
      addition, this document also considers the new use cases for
      AH/ESP deployment, such as IoT.</t>

      <t> It is expected that deprecation of an algorithm be performed
      gradually. This provides time for various implementations to
      update their implemented algorithms while remaining
      interoperable. Unless there are strong security reasons, an
      algorithm is expected to be downgraded from MUST to MUST- or
      SHOULD, instead of MUST NOT (see <xref target="terms"/>). Similarly, an algorithm that has
      not been mentioned as mandatory-to-implement is expected to be
      introduced with a SHOULD instead of a MUST.</t>

      <t>The current trend toward IoT and its adoption
      of AH/ESP requires this specific use case to be taken into
      account as well. IoT devices are resource-constrained devices,
      and their choice of algorithms is motivated by minimizing the
      footprint of the code, the computation effort, and the size of
      the messages to send. This document indicates "(IoT)" when a
      specified algorithm is specifically listed for IoT devices.
      Requirement levels that are marked as "IoT" apply to IoT devices
      and to server-side implementations that might presumably need to
      interoperate with them, including any general-purpose VPN
      gateways.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="Document Audience">
      <t>The recommendations of this document mostly target AH/ESP
      implementers as implementations need to meet both high security
      expectations as well as high interoperability between various
      vendors and with different versions. Interoperability requires a
      smooth move to more secure cipher suites. This may differ from a
      user point of view that may deploy and configure AH/ESP with only
      the safest cipher suite.</t>

      <t>This document does not give any recommendations for the use
      of algorithms, it only gives recommendations for
      implementations. The use of algorithms by users is dictated by
      the security policy requirements for that specific user and is
      outside the scope of this document.</t>

      <t>The algorithms considered here are listed by IANA as part 
      of the IKEv2 parameters. IKEv1 is out of scope of this document.
      IKEv1 is deprecated; the recommendations of this document must
      not be considered for IKEv1, nor may IKEv1 parameters be considered by
      this document.</t>

      <t>The IANA registry for "Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2)
      Parameters" contains some entries that are not for use with ESP or AH.
      This document does not modify the status of those algorithms.</t>

       Manual keying SHOULD NOT be used, as it is inherently dangerous.

       Without any secure keying protocol, such as IKE, IPsec does not
       offer Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) protection; there is no
       entity to ensure the refreshing of session keys, the tracking of Security
       Parameter Index (SPI) uniqueness, and the single use of nonces, Initialization Vectors (IVs), and counters (i.e., they cannot be reused).  This
       document was written for deploying ESP/AH using IKE
       <xref target="RFC7296"/> and assumes that keying happens using
       IKEv2 or higher.
       </t>
       <t>
       If manual keying is used regardless, Counter Mode algorithms
       such as ENCR_AES_CTR, ENCR_AES_CCM, ENCR_AES_GCM, and
       ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305 MUST NOT be used, as it is incompatible
       with a secure and persistent handling of the counter (as explained
       in the Security Considerations section of <xref target="RFC3686"/>).
       This particularly applies to IoT devices that have no state across
       reboots. At the time of writing, ENCR_AES_CBC is
       the only mandatory-to-implement encryption algorithm suitable for
       manual keying.

</section>

<section title="Encryption Must Be Authenticated">
      <t>
      Encryption without authentication is not effective and MUST NOT be used.
      IPsec offers three ways to provide both encryption and authentication:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
         <t> ESP with an Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) cipher </t>
         <t> ESP with a non-AEAD cipher + authentication </t>
         <t> ESP with a non-AEAD cipher + AH with authentication </t>
         </list> </t>

      <t>
      The fastest and most modern method is to use ESP with a
      combined mode cipher, such as an AEAD cipher, that handles
      encryption/decryption and authentication in a single step. In
      this case, the AEAD cipher is set as the encryption algorithm, and
      the authentication algorithm is set to none. Examples of this are
      ENCR_AES_GCM_16 and ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305.  </t>

      <t>
      A more traditional approach is to use ESP with an encryption and
      an authentication algorithm.  This approach is slower, as the data
      has to be processed twice: once for encryption/decryption and once
      for authentication. An example of this is ENCR_AES_CBC combined
      with AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512_256.  </t>

      <t>
      The last method that can be used is ESP+AH. This method is NOT
      RECOMMENDED. It is the slowest method and also takes up more octets
      due to the double header of ESP+AH. This results in a smaller yet effective
      MTU for the encrypted data. With this method, ESP is only used for
      confidentiality without an authentication algorithm, and a second
      IPsec protocol of type AH is used for authentication. 
An example of
      this is ESP with ENCR_AES_CBC with AH with AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512_256. </t>

<t>[1] - This requirement level is for 128-bit and 256-bit keys. 192-bit keys remain at the MAY level.</t>

<t>(IoT) - This requirement is for interoperability with IoT. Only 128-bit keys are at the given level.</t>

         <t>IPsec sessions may have very long lifetime and carry multiple packets, 
         so there is a need to move to 256-bit keys in the long term. For that purpose, 
         the requirement level for 128-bit keys and 256-bit keys is MUST 
         (when applicable). In that sense, the status for 256-bit keys has been raised from 
         MAY in <xref target="RFC7321"/> to MUST.</t> 

         <t>IANA has allocated codes for cryptographic algorithms that have 
         not been specified by the IETF. Such algorithms are noted as UNSPECIFIED.
         Usually, the use of these algorithms is limited to specific cases, and the absence
         of specification makes interoperability difficult for IPsec communications. These 
         algorithms were not mentioned in <xref target="RFC7321"/>, and this document
         clarifies that such algorithms MUST NOT be implemented for IPsec communications.</t>

         <t>Similarly, IANA also allocated code points for algorithms that are
         not expected to be used to secure IPsec communications. Such algorithms
         are noted as non-IPsec. As a result, these algorithms MUST NOT be implemented.</t>

         <t>Various ciphers that are older, not well tested, and never widely implemented have been
         changed to MUST NOT.</t>

         <t>ENCR_3DES status has been downgraded from MAY in <xref target="RFC7321"/> to SHOULD NOT. 
         ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305 is a more modern approach and alternative for ENCR_3DES
         than ENCR_AES_CBC, and so it is expected to be favored to replace ENCR_3DES.</t>

         <t>ENCR_BLOWFISH has been downgraded to MUST NOT as it has been deprecated for
         years by TWOFISH, which is not standarized for ESP and therefore not listed
         in this document. Some implementations support TWOFISH using a private range
         number.</t>

         <t>ENCR_NULL status was set to MUST in <xref target="RFC7321"/> and remains
         a MUST to enable the use of ESP with only authentication, which is preferred
         over AH due to NAT traversal. ENCR_NULL is expected to remain MUST by protocol
         requirements.</t> 
        
         <t>ENCR_AES_CBC status remains at MUST. ENCR_AES_CBC MUST be implemented in
         order to enable interoperability between implementations that
	 followed <xref target="RFC7321"/>.
         However, there is a trend for the industry to move to AEAD encryption, and the
         overhead of ENCR_AES_CBC remains quite large, so it is expected to be replaced
         by AEAD algorithms in the long term.</t>
        
         <t>ENCR_AES_CCM_8 status was set to MAY in <xref target="RFC7321"/> and has been
         raised from MAY to SHOULD in order to interact with IoT devices. As
         this case is not a general use case for VPNs, its status is expected to remain as
         SHOULD.</t>

         <t>ENCR_AES_GCM_16 status has been updated from SHOULD+ to MUST
         in order to favor the use of authenticated encryption and AEAD algorithms.
         ENCR_AES_GCM_16 has been widely implemented for ESP due to its increased
         performance and key longevity compared to ENCR_AES_CBC.</t>
         
        <t>ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305 was not ready to be considered at the time
	of <xref target="RFC7321"/>.


        It has been recommended by the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) and others as an alternative to AES-CBC and
        AES-GCM. It is also being standardized for ESP for the same reasons.
        At the time of writing, there are not enough ESP implementations of ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305
        to be able to introduce it at the SHOULD+ level. Its status has been set to SHOULD
        and is expected to become MUST in the long term.</t>

<!--[rfced] A few questions related to tables in this document and their descriptive text.

a) Might it be easier for the reader to digest the information related
to changes from RFC 7321 (such as those in 5th-11th paragraphs after
the table in Section 5) if they appeared in table form with footnotes?
(We see that Section 8 contains a summary, but thinking that it might
be easier to see this information sooner than later...perhaps the
summary could be a compilation of all of the tables in Sections 5-7
instead?)

For example (please excuse the crudity of this model):

Name            / RFC 7321 Status / Current Status    / AEAD  / Comment
ENCR_AES_CCM_8     MAY[1]             SHOULD(IoT)       Yes     [RFC4309] 

[1] ENCR_AES_CCM_8 status was set to MAY in [RFC7321] and has been raised
    from MAY to SHOULD in order to interact with Internet of Things
    devices.  As this case is not a general use case for VPNs, its status
    is expected to remain as SHOULD.

b) We see (IoT) next to the requirement level in the table in Section 5, but in
the "Comment" field of the table in Section 6.  Please let us know
if/how updates to make these uses uniform may be made.

c) We see that (IoT) is listed below the table in Section 7, but is
not in the table itself.  Please let us know how to update.

d) Please note that we removed the square brackets around
"UNSPECIFIED" in the table in Section 6 as the other tables do not use
them (and so that they are not confused for citations).

e) In the table in Section 6, we see "MUST / MUST NOT" for AUTH_NONE,
and the text that follows describes the reasoning.  However, the text
describing AUTH_AES_XCBC_96 seems to describe a similar type of
conjunction between SHOULD and MAY, but this is not reflected in the
text.  Should these types of relationships be treated the same?
Please review and let us know if/how we should update.

<t>(IoT) - This requirement is for interoperability with IoT.</t>

        <t>AUTH_NONE has been downgraded from MAY in <xref target="RFC7321"/> to MUST NOT. The only case where AUTH_NONE 
        is acceptable is when authenticated encryption algorithms are selected from 
        <xref target="sec-encr"/>. In all other cases, AUTH_NONE MUST NOT be selected. As ESP and
        AH both provide authentication, one may be tempted to combine these protocols to 
        provide authentication. As mentioned by <xref target="RFC7321"/>, it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use 
        ESP with NULL authentication (with non-authenticated encryption) in conjunction
        with AH; some configurations of this combination of services have been shown to be
        insecure <xref target="PD10"/>. In addition, AUTH_NONE authentication cannot be
        combined with ESP NULL encryption.</t>
        
        <t>AUTH_HMAC_MD5_96 and AUTH_KPDK_MD5 were not mentioned in <xref target="RFC7321"/>.  As MD5 is known
        to be vulnerable to collisions, these algorithms MUST NOT be used. </t>

        <t>AUTH_HMAC_SHA1_96 has been downgraded from MUST in <xref target="RFC7321"/> to MUST- as 
        there is an industry-wide trend to deprecate its usage.</t>

        <t>AUTH_DES_MAC was not mentioned in <xref target="RFC7321"/>. As DES is known to be vulnerable, 
        it MUST NOT be used.</t>

        <t>AUTH_AES_XCBC_96 is set as SHOULD only in the scope of IoT, as IoT 
        deployments tend to prefer AES-based Hashed Message Authentication
	Code (HMAC) functions in order to avoid
        implementing SHA2. For the wide VPN deployment, as it has not been widely adopted,
        it has been downgraded from SHOULD to MAY.</t>

<!--[rfced] We do not see mention of ENCR_AES_CTR, AUTH_AES_192_GMAC,
ENCR_NULL_AUTH_AES_GMAC, or AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_384 in any of the
tables.  Please review the text below and let us know if updates are necessary.

Original:

AUTH_AES_128_GMAC status has been downgraded from SHOULD+ to MAY.
Along with AUTH_AES_192_GMAC and AUTH_AES_256_GMAC, these algorithms
should only be used for AH and not for ESP.

...

If using AES-GMAC in ESP without authentication,
ENCR_NULL_AUTH_AES_GMAC is recommended.

...

This value has been preferred to AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_384, as the
additional overhead of AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512 is negligible.

        <t>AUTH_AES_128_GMAC status has been downgraded from SHOULD+ to MAY. Along with 
        AUTH_AES_192_GMAC and AUTH_AES_256_GMAC, these algorithms should only be used for AH
        and not for ESP. If using ENCR_NULL, AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128 is recommended for integrity.
        If using AES-GMAC in ESP without authentication, ENCR_NULL_AUTH_AES_GMAC is recommended. Therefore,
        these ciphers are kept at MAY.</t>

        <t>AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128 was not mentioned in <xref target="RFC7321"/>, as no SHA2-based authentication
        was mentioned. AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128 MUST be implemented in order to replace
        AUTH_HMAC_SHA1_96. Note that due to a long standing common implementation bug of this
        algorithm that truncates the hash at 96 bits instead of 128 bits, it is recommended that
        implementations prefer AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512_256 over AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128 if they implement
        AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512_256.</t>

        <t>AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512_256 SHOULD be implemented as a future replacement of 
        AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128 or when stronger security is required. This value has been preferred
        to AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_384, as the additional overhead of AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512 is negligible.</t>

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
   <t>The security of a system that uses cryptography depends on both the
   strength of the cryptographic algorithms chosen and the strength of
   the keys used with those algorithms.  The security also depends on
   the engineering and administration of the protocol used by the system
   to ensure that there are no non-cryptographic ways to bypass the
   security of the overall system.</t>

   <t>This document concerns itself with the selection of cryptographic
   algorithms for the use of ESP and AH, specifically with the selection
   of mandatory-to-implement algorithms.  The algorithms identified in
   this document as "MUST implement" or "SHOULD implement" are not known
   to be broken at the current time, and cryptographic research to date
   leads us to believe that they will likely remain secure into the
   foreseeable future.  However, this is not necessarily forever.
   Therefore, we expect that revisions of that document will be issued
   from time to time to reflect the current best practice in this area.</t>
