    <t>
Mobile IPv6 defines a set of signaling messages that enable the mobile node (MN)
to authenticate and perform registration with its home agent
(HA). These authentication signaling messages between the mobile node
and home agent are secured by an IPsec security association (SA) that
is established between 
the MN and HA. The MIP6 working group has specified a mechanism to
secure the Binding Update (BU) and Binding Acknowledgement (BAck) messages using
an authentication option, similar to the authentication option in Mobile
IPv4,  carried within the signaling messages that are exchanged between the MN
and HA to establish a binding. This document provides the
justifications as to why the authentication option mechanism is needed
for Mobile IPv6 deployment in certain environments.

<section title="Introduction">
<t>
Mobile IPv6 relies on the IPsec Security Association between the
    Mobile Node (MN) and the Home Agent (HA) for authentication of
the MN
    to its HA before a binding cache can be created at the HA.  An
    alternate mechanism that does not rely on the existence of the IPsec
    SA between the MN and HA for authenticating the MN is needed in
    certain deployment environments. Such an alternate mechanism is
outlined
    in [RFC4285]. This document is intended to capture for archival
purposes
    the reasoning behind the need for the authentication protocol
[RFC4285].
It should be noted that
the alternate solution does not imply that the IPsec-based solution
will be deprecated. It simply means that in certain deployment
scenarios there is a need for supporting MIPv6 without an IPsec SA
between the MN and HA. So the alternate solution is in addition
to the IPsec-based mechanism specified in the base RFCs, i.e., <xref
target="RFC3775"></xref>, <xref target="RFC3776"></xref>,
and <xref target="RFC4877"></xref>. 
It has been noted that some of the challenges of 
deploying MIPv6 in certain types of networks arose from dependence
on the Internet Key Exchange (IKE), which did not integrate well with
an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) backend
infrastructure. IKEv2 solves this problem. However, at the time
of discussion on the need for the authentication protocol, <xref target="RFC4877">
    "Mobile IPv6 Operation with IKEv2 and the Revised IPsec
    Architecture" </xref> was still a work in progress and, as a result, an 
alternative solution was needed.</t>

<t>
It should be noted that some of the arguments for justifying the
specification of the authentication protocol have been made redundant
as a result of the specification of Mobile IPv6 operation with IKEv2
<xref target="RFC4877"></xref>. However, some of the arguments
discussed in this document are still applicable and justify usage of
the authentication protocol in certain deployment environments.

<section title="Applicability Statement" anchor="Applicability">
<t>
The authentication option specified in <xref
target="RFC4285"> "Authentication Protocol for MIPv6" </xref> provides
a solution for MIPv6 deployment in environments in which an operator may
not require IPsec-based security for the signaling. The reasons for an
operator choosing to deploy MIPv6 without mandating IPsec-based
security for signaling messages between the MN and HA could be
many. Some of these are, for example:
</t>
<t><list style="numbers">
<t>Operators deploying MIPv6 in cellular networks may consider IPsec and
IKEv2 as adding overhead to the limited bandwidth over the air
interface. The overhead here is in terms of the bytes that IPsec and
  IKEv2 introduce to the signaling.</t>
<t>Operators may consider the number of messages between
the MN and HA that are required to establish the IPsec SA as too
  many. The number of transactions chew into the capacity of limited
  bandwidth air interfaces when MIPv6 is used in such environments. It
  also adds additional latency to the establishment of the
  binding. </t>
<t>In many deployments, authentication credentials already exist in
  a AAA server. These credentials are used for authenticating a user
  and authorizing network access. The same credentials and
  security parameters cannot be reused for MIPv6 security as well,
  if IKEv1 is used.  </t>
<t>Dynamic assignment of home agents is needed in certain deployments
  to minimize the latency of the backhaul. This is done by allocating
  an HA in a visited network, for example. Requiring IPsec SAs with
  home agents that are dynamically assigned is an overhead, especially
  when the HA is in a visited network. </t>
<t>In certain deployments, signaling messages between the MN and HA
  may be over secure link layers. The lower layers provide
  ciphering and security for the messages, and hence the need for IPsec
  to do the same for MIPv6 messages does not exist.</t>
</list></t>
<t>
One example of networks that have such characteristics are Code
Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
networks as defined in the 3GPP2 <xref target="3GPP2 X.S0011-002-D"></xref>
specification. Mobile WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for 
Microwave Access), which is based on IEEE 802.16e, also specifies in the network architecture the use of MIPv6,
with the default security for signaling being 
the authentication protocol [RFC4285]. The WiMAX network architecture
specifications are available at <xref target="WiMAX-NWG"></xref>.

Justification

-->

<section title="Justification for the Use of the Authentication Option" anchor="Justification">
<t>
The following two sections provide the reasoning for why the
authentication option-based registration process for Mobile IPv6 is needed.
Section 5.1 provides key arguments for the use of the authentication
option. Section 5.2 provides further explanation and additional
motivations for the authentication option.  
</t>
<section title="Motivation for Use of the Authentication Option in
CDMA2000 Wireless Networks">
<t>
CDMA2000 networks deployed and operational today use Mobile IPv4 for
IP mobility. Operators have gained a significant amount of operational
experience in the process of deploying and operating these
networks. 3GPP2 has specified Mobile IPv6 operation in the
<xref target="3GPP2 X.S0011-002-D"></xref> specification. 
The following are the
deployment constraints that existing CDMA networks have to deal with
when deploying mobility service based on IPv6:  
</t>
<t><list style="symbols">
<t>Operators intend to leverage the Mobile IPv4 deployment and
operational experience by ensuring that Mobile IPv6 has a similar
deployment and operating model.</t> 
<t>Operators will have two parallel networks: one that offers IPv4
mobility with MIPv4 and another providing IPv6 mobility using MIPv6.</t> 
<t>The same backend subscriber profile  database, security keys,
etc. are intended to be used for both Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6
service. However, from a security standpoint, the reuse of the same
  keys with multiple algorithms/protocols is a bad idea.</t>  
<t>The same user-configuration information, i.e., the identity and keys
associated with a user, will be used for IP mobility service in
IPv4 and/or IPv6 networks. The only security association that is
preconfigured is a shared secret between the mobile node and the
home AAA server. This is in contrast with an earlier version of the 
Mobile IPv6 model, which required an IPsec SA between the MN and
HA. At the time of this writing, the IKEv2-based solution for
  establishing an IPsec SA <xref target="RFC4877"></xref> was not
  available. IKEv2 does enable integration with a AAA backend.</t> 
<t> At the time of specifying the authentication protocol, the  Mobile
  IPv6 specification did not support the dynamic 
assignment of home agent and home address.  However, work done in the
  MIP6 working group on bootstrapping of Mobile
  IPv6 as specified in <xref target="RFC5026"></xref> and
  <xref
     target="BOOT">"MIPv6-Bootstrapping
    for the Integrated Scenario"</xref> addresses this deficiency. 
The mechanism defined in <xref target="RFC4285">
"Authentication Protocol for Mobile IPv6" </xref> is capable of handling
  authentication even in 
the case of dynamic assignments (and is similar to what is used in
current MIPv4 deployments).
</t>
</list></t>
<t>
Consequently, MIPv6 as specified at the time the authentication
protocol was being specified, did not satisfy many of the deployment
requirements. <xref target="RFC4285">
"Authentication Protocol for MIPv6" </xref> along with <xref
target="RFC4283"> "MN Identifier Option for MIPv6" </xref>
are enabling the deployment of Mobile IPv6 in a manner that is similar
to what is deployed in CDMA2000 networks today. This authentication
model is very similar to the one adopted by the MIP4 WG. This is
explained in detail in <xref target="3GPP2 X.S0011-002-D"></xref>. 
</t>
<t>
The earlier MIPv6 deployment model, which requires an IPsec SA that is 
either configured manually or established using IKE, does not have synergy 
with the deployment models of 3GPP2 or WiMAX networks. This issue has 
however been alleviated with the publication of RFC 4877, which enables the 
establishment of an IPsec SA using IKEv2 and which is also able to integrate with the 
backend AAA infrastrucuture that is responsible for the authentication of 
the MN in 3GPP2 and WiMAX networks.
 
</t>
</section>
<section title="Additional Arguments for the Use of the Authentication Option">
<t>
The use of IPsec for performing Registration with a home agent is
not always an optimal solution. While it is true that IPsec is
viewed as an integral part of the IPv6 stack, it is still a considerable overhead
from a deployment perspective of using IPsec as the security mechanism
for the signaling messages between the MN and HA. This statement is a
result of experience gained from deployment of Mobile IPv4. MIPv4 does
not rely on IPsec for securing the Registration signaling
messages. 
</t>
<t>
Deployment of Mobile IPv6 on a large scale is possible only when
the protocol is flexible for being adapted to various scenarios.
The scenario being considered is the deployment in CDMA2000 networks
or WiMAX networks. CDMA2000 networks are currently deployed in 
many countries today.  WiMAX deployments in many countries began in
2008.  The packet
data network architecture of <xref target="3GPP2 X.S0011-002-D"> 
CDMA2000 </xref> includes a MIPv4 foreign agent/home agent and a
RADIUS-based AAA infrastrucutre for Authentication, Authorization, and
Accounting purposes. The AAA infrastructure provides 
authentication capability in the case of Mobile IPv4. 
</t>
<t>
Typically, the mobile node shares a security association with the
AAA-Home entity. This is the preferred mode of operation over
having a shared secret between the MN and HA because the AAA-Home
entity provides a central location for provisioning and administering
the shared secrets for a large number of mobiles (millions). This mode
of operation also makes dynamic home address and dynamic home agent
assignment easier. A similar approach is needed for the deployment of
Mobile IPv6 in these networks. There is no practical mechanism to use
IPsec directly with the AAA infrastructure without the use of IKEv2 or
some other mechanism that enables the establishment of the IPsec SA
between the MN and HA. 
</t>
<t>
Mobile IPv6 as specified in <xref target="RFC3775"></xref>
and <xref target="RFC3776"></xref> is based on a very 
specific model for deployment. It anticipates the mobile node's
having a static home IPv6 address and a designated home agent. This is
not practical in most deployment scenarios being considered. An
IPsec SA is expected to be created via manual keying or
established dynamically via IKE or IKEv2. These assumptions do not
necessarily fit in very well for the deployment model envisioned
in CDMA2000 or WiMAX networks. These limitations have however been overcome as
a result of the bootstrapping specifications as per <xref target="RFC5026"></xref> and
  <xref
     target="BOOT">"MIPv6-Bootstrapping
    for the Integrated Scenario"</xref>.
</t>
<t>
CDMA2000 and WiMAX networks would prefer to allocate home addresses to MNs
on a dynamic basis. The advantage of doing so is the fact that the
HA can be assigned on a link that is close to the MN's point of
attachment. While route optimization negates the benefit of having
a home agent on a link close to the MN, it cannot always be
guaranteed that the MN and correspondent node (CN) will use or support route
optimization. There may also be instances where the operator prefers
to not allow route optimization for various reasons, such as accounting
aggregation or enforcing service contracts. In such cases, an HA that
is close to the MN's point of attachment reduces the issues of latency,
etc. of forward and reverse tunnelling of packets between the MN and
HA. 
</t>
<t>
CDMA2000 networks that are operational today have large numbers of
subscribers who are authenticated via the AAA infrastrucure.
Deployment of Mobile IPv6 should leverage the existing AAA
infrastructure. The security model needed in these networks is an SA
between the MN and AAA-Home entity. This is the primary security 
association that should be used for authenticating and authorizing
users to utilize MIPv6 service. This SA is then used for establishing
session keys between the MN and the dynamically assigned HA for
authenticating subsequent Binding Updates and Binding Acknowledgements
between them. Establishing an IPsec SA between the MN and HA using AAA
infrastrucure was not specified for Mobile IPv6 at the time the
authentication protocol was being specified. RFC 3776 explains
how IKE is used for establishing the SA between the MN and
HA. <xref target="RFC4877"></xref> has been published subsequently and
hence the issue of establishing an IPsec SA dynamically between the MN
and HA no longer exists. 
CDMA2000 network operators would prefer to assign home addresses to
the MN on a dynamic basis -- preferably using the AAA
infrastructure, which contains subscriber profile and capability
information. This was not possible prior to the specification of the
bootstrapping mechanism in <xref target="RFC5026"></xref>. 
</t>
<t>
A large subset of MNs in CDMA2000 networks do not have IKE
capability. As a result, the use of RFC 3776 for setting up the MN-HA
IPsec SA is not an option. It should also be noted that IKE requires
several transactions before it is able to establish the IPsec
SA. <xref target="RFC4877"></xref> specifies the establishment of an
IPsec SA between the MN and HA using IKEv2. It is possible that not
all MNs in a deployment will support IKEv2, and hence an alternative
mechanism provides the needed flexibility. 
</t>
<t>
CDMA2000 network operators are extremely conscious in terms of the
number of messages sent and received over the air interface for
signaling. The overhead associated with sending/receiving a large
number of signaling messages over the air interface has a direct
impact on the overall capacity and cost for the operator. Optimization
of the number of messages needed for using a service like Mobile IPv6
is of great concern. As a result, the use of IKE for Mobile IPv6
deployment is considered as being suboptimal in certain network architectures and deployment scenarios from the perspective of message overhead.
</t>
<t>
Another downside of IKE for setting up the IPsec SA between the MN and
HA is that IKE does not integrate very well with the RADIUS-based AAA
backend. Since operators rely on the AAA infrastrucure to provision
subscribers as well as define profiles, keys, etc. in the AAA-Home,
there is no getting away from the use of AAA in CDMA2000
networks. IKEv2 does address this problem. However, from a timeline
perspective, the availability of IKEv2 specifications for <xref
target="RFC4877"> "Mobile IPv6 Operation with IKEv2 and the Revised
    IPsec Architecture" </xref>  
and its implementations did not meet the need of operators that were
relying on 3GPP2 specifications. With the specification of IKEv2 and
publication of RFC 4877, integration with AAA backends is no longer
an issue. 
</t>
<t>
In summary, the model of Mobile IPv6 deployment that mandated
the existence of an IPsec SA between the MN and HA, as specified in
RFCs 3775 and 3776, was too rigid and did not meet the requirements of
operators building networks based on the <xref target="3GPP2 X.S0011-002-D">
CDMA2000 </xref> specifications. To address this shortcoming, the
authentication protocol <xref target="RFC4285"></xref> was specified.

The CDMA mobility architecture based on MIPv4 is explained below. In this
architecture, mobility is tightly integrated with the AAA
infrastructure. The Mobile Node is configured with an NAI (Network Access
Identifier) and an MN-AAA key. The MN-AAA key is a shared key that is
shared between the MN and the home AAA server.

	Security Parameter Index (SPI)
	field in MN-AAA is set to 3 (as per [RFC4285]). The BU also

<t>
The MN derives the session key and SA  using the timestamp in the BU
that the MN sent and the MN-AAA shared key. The MN uses this key to
authenticate the MN-HA option in the Binding Ack.  If authentication
is successful, the MN creates a security association with SPI=5. This
key is used to authenticate further BUs to the HA using the MN-HA
auth option. Once the binding lifetime expires and the binding is
deleted, the binding as well as the security association based on
the integrity key is removed at the MN and HA.
</t>
<t>
Migration from MobileIPv4 to MobileIPv6 utilizes the same network
architecture and, specifically, the same AAA infrastructure. Thus, it
is natural to have similar signaling in MIPv6 as in MIPv4, specifically
the authentication with AAA infrastructure.

<section title="Limitations of the Authentication Protocol Option">

<t>
While the authentication protocol as specified
in <xref target="RFC4285"></xref> provides Mobile
IPv6 <xref target="RFC3775"></xref> deployments a certain degree of
flexibility, it does have a few disadvantages as well. 
These are:
</t>
<t><list hangIndent="5" style="hanging">
      <t hangText="(1)">The route optimization feature specified in
	RFC 3775 requires a secure transport (IPsec/ESP (Encapsulating
	Security Payload) mode) between
	the MN and HA. In cases where the authentication protocol
	[RFC4285] is used as the means for securing the MIPv6 signaling
	between the MN and HA, route optimization should be switched
	off unless the security of the signaling between the MN and HA
	can be guaranteed via other means (such as link-layer security
	in the case of 3GPP2 networks). </t>

      <t hangText="(2)">The MIPv6 protocol is responsible for the
	security of the signaling messages as opposed to relying on
	IPsec for providing the security. </t> 

      <t hangText="(3)">In 3GPP2 networks, link-layer security
	mechanisms, ingress filtering at the PDSN, and various network
	domain security mechanisms largely ensure that reverse
	tunnelled packets received by the HA do not have spoofed source
	addresses, and that their contents have not been modified.  This
	implies the HA can determine the specific MN that sent the
	packet simply by verifying the outer-source IP address matches
	the currently registered care-of address. Authentication of
	payload packets can be necessary for, e.g.: </t>
      <list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
	  <t hangText="-"> Authenticating signaling messages
	other than BU/BAck between the MN and HA, such as ICMPv6, MLD, and
	DHCPv6. </t> 
	  <t hangText="-">Enforcing access control to the network
	    behind the HA. </t>
	  <t hangText="-">Accounting or other flow-specific
	    processing performed by the HA. </t>
	    <t>This means the authentication option is of
	    limited applicability in environments where the HA can
	    receive reverse-tunneled packets with spoofed source IP
	    addresses and/or modified contents. </t>
      </list>

      <t hangText="(4)">As described
	in <xref target="RFC4285"></xref>, the authentication 
	option assumes that the MN-AAA shared key and security
	association are created by out-of-band mechanisms.  These
	mechanisms are specific to specific deployment
	environments. IKEv2, on the other hand, supports a wide range
	of authentication mechanisms, such as certificates and
	Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
	methods, and is independent of the access network technology
	being used.  However, it would be possible to specify a
	similar authentication and key management protocol for the
	authentication option in the future. </t>

      <t hangText="(5)">Sending the long-term user identity (NAI) in the
	clear raises privacy concerns. These concerns are addressed by
	access network and network domain security mechanisms in 3GPP2
	networks, but do limit the applicability in networks where
	sniffing other users' traffic is possible. </t>

      <t hangText="(6)"> RFC 4285 does not specify a mechanism for
	creating the MN-HA shared key and SA from the MN-AAA SA
	(unlike similar Mobile IPv4 mechanisms defined
	in <xref target="RFC3957"></xref>), and thus relies on
	deployment-specific mechanisms not standardized in the IETF. </t>

      <t hangText="(7)">The authentication option does not support
	negotiation of cryptographic algorithms.</t>

      <t hangText="(8)">The replay protection mechanisms
	in <xref target="RFC4285"></xref> rely on timestamps, and thus
	require reasonably synchronized clocks (by default, +/- 7
	seconds). This assumes the MN implements, and is configured to
	use, some mechanism for synchronizing its clock. </t>

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>
When MIPv6 signaling messages use IPsec with ESP encapsulation, they
are accorded privacy on the links over which the messages
traverse. When MIPv6 signaling messages are secured using the
authentication protocol, such ciphering capability will have to be
enabled by the underlying link layers. It should be noted that the
MIPv6 signaling messages are susceptible to snooping/sniffing when the
authentication protocol <xref target="RFC4285"></xref> is used. 
Route optimization messages need to be secured between the MN and HA
and this is not possible with the authentication protocol. However,
route optimization is not supported in the current specification of
the authentication protocol in <xref target="RFC4285"></xref>. 
</t>
<t>
Security issues with RFC 4285 are specifically:
</t><t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>Key length. This is being addressed in 
<xref target="AUTH-PRO"></xref>.</t>
<t>The keys used for securing the signaling between the MN and HA are
   derived from a security association that exists between the MN and
   AAA. The MIPv6 keys, which are bootstrapped from the MN-AAA SA, are
   transient. Limiting the lifetime of the keys to shorter periods
   should be recommended.</t>
<t>Location privacy is an issue in the absence of lower-layer security

      ## CONCLUSION ##
   
-->
<section title="Conclusion">

<t>
Mobile IPv6 was published as a Standards Track
RFC <xref target="RFC3775"></xref> in 2004. Deployment of
this protocol on a large scale is in the interest of the IETF and
the working group, as well as that of many people who have worked on
this. A rigid model for deployment will cause the protocol to be
limited to an academic exercise only. It is extremely critical
that the working group consider the needs of the industry and the
deployment scenarios, and address them accordingly. 
This document captures the reasoning behind the need for the
authentication protocol, which has been published as RFC 4285.
RFC 4877 has alleviated some of the issues that have been of primary
concern and were motivators for the authentication protocol. However, the IETF
should consider the architectures of networks such as 3GPP2 and WiMAX and their
security models, and enable deployment of Mobile IPv6 without requiring IPsec.
