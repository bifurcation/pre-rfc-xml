<t>     
   This document describes extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol -
   Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for locally protecting the egress node(s) of
   a Point-to-Point (P2P) or Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Traffic Engineered (TE) 
   Label Switched Path (LSP).
</t> 
</abstract>

<middle>

<section title="Introduction">
    
<t>
<xref target="RFC4090"/> describes two methods for locally protecting the transit nodes 
of a P2P LSP: one-to-one and facility protection.  <xref target="RFC4875"/> specifies how
these methods can be used to protect the transit nodes of a P2MP LSP.  
These documents do not discuss the procedures for locally protecting
the egress node(s) of an LSP.
</t>

<t>
This document fills that void and specifies extensions to RSVP-TE for 
local protection of the egress node(s) of an LSP. 
"Egress node" and "egress" are used interchangeably.
</t>

<section title="Local Protection of Egress Nodes">
<t>
In general, locally protecting an egress node of an LSP
means that when the egress node fails, the traffic that the LSP carries
will be delivered to its destination by the direct upstream node
of the egress node to a backup egress node.
Without protecting the egress node of the LSP, when the egress node
fails, the traffic will be lost (i.e., the traffic will not be delivered
to its destination).</t>

<t>
<xref target="P2MP-sub-LSP4-Egress"/> shows an example of using backup LSPs to locally protect
egress nodes L1 and L2 of a primary P2MP LSP starting from ingress node R1. 
La and Lb are the designated backup egress nodes for primary 
egress nodes L1 and L2, respectively. The backup LSP for protecting L1 
is from its upstream node R3 to backup egress node La, and the backup LSP 
for protecting L2 is from R5 to Lb.

<t>
During normal operations, the traffic carried by the P2MP LSP is 
sent through R3 to L1, which delivers the traffic to its destination CE1. 
When R3 detects the failure of L1, 
R3 switches the traffic to the backup LSP to backup egress node La, 
which delivers the traffic to CE1. 

The time for switching the traffic is within tens of milliseconds.
</t>

<t>
The exact mechanism by which the failure of the primary egress node is
detected by the upstream node R3 is out of the scope of this document.
</t>

<t>
In the beginning, 
the primary P2MP LSP from ingress node R1 to primary egress nodes L1 and L2
is configured. It may be used to transport the traffic from 
source S, which is connected to R1, to destinations CE1 and CE2, which are connected
to L1 and L2, respectively.
</t>

<t>
To protect the primary egress nodes L1 and L2,
one configures on the ingress node R1 
a backup egress node for L1, 
another backup egress node for L2, and other options.
After the configuration, the ingress node sends a Path message for the LSP with information such as the Secondary
Explicit Route Objects (SEROs), refer to <xref target="extensions_to_SERO"/>, containing the backup egress nodes 
for protecting the primary egress nodes. 
</t>

<t>
After receiving the Path message with the information,
the upstream node of a primary egress node sets up a backup LSP 
to the corresponding backup egress node for protecting the
primary egress node.

<section title="Extensions to SERO" anchor="extensions_to_SERO">

    <t>The Secondary Explicit Route Object (SERO) is defined in <xref target="RFC4873"/>. The format of the SERO is reused. 
</t>

   <t>The SERO used for protecting a primary egress node of a primary LSP may be added into the Path messages for the LSP and sent from the ingress node of the LSP to the upstream node of the egress node. It contains three subobjects. </t>
 
<t>The first subobject (refer to Section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC4873"/>) indicates the branch node 
that is to originate the backup LSP (to a backup egress node).
The branch node is typically the direct upstream node of 
the primary egress node 
of the primary LSP.

If the direct upstream node does not support local protection
against the failure of the primary egress node, the branch node can be
any (upstream) node on the primary LSP.

In this case, 
the backup LSP from the branch node to the backup egress node 
protects against failures on the segment of the primary LSP
from the branch node to, and including, the primary egress node. 
</t>

   <t>The second subobject is an Egress Protection subobject, which
is a PROTECTION object with a new C-Type (3).   
The format of the Egress Protection subobject is defined as follows:

E-Flags are defined for local protection of egress nodes.
  <list style="hanging"> 
     <t hangText='Bit 31 ("egress local protection" flag):'> 
      It is the least significant bit of the 32-bit word

      It is the second least significant bit of the 32-bit word

      for protecting an egress node of a P2MP LSP.</t>
  </list>

The Reserved parts MUST be set to zero on transmission
and MUST be ignored on receipt.
</t>

<t>
Four optional subobjects are defined: they are 
IPv4 and IPv6 primary egress node subobjects as well as IPv4 and IPv6 P2P LSP ID subobjects.

IPv4 and IPv6 primary egress node subobjects indicate 
the IPv4 and IPv6 address of the primary egress node, respectively. 
IPv4 and IPv6 P2P LSP ID subobjects contain the information for 
identifying IPv4 and IPv6 backup P2P LSP tunnels, 
respectively.

Their contents are described in Sections <xref target="primary_egress_subobject"
format="counter"/> through <xref target="ipv6_p2p_lsp_id_subobject" format="counter"/>.

They have the following format:

</figure>
where Type is the type of a subobject and Length is the total size of the subobject in bytes, 
including Type, Length, and Contents fields. 
The Reserved field MUST be set to zero on transmission
and MUST be ignored on receipt.
</t>

   <t>The third (final) subobject (refer to Section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC4873"/>) 
in the SERO contains the egress node of the backup LSP, i.e., 
the address of the backup egress node in the place of the merge node.
</t>

    <t>After the upstream node of the primary egress node 
(a.k.a. the branch node) receives the SERO 
and determines a backup egress node for the primary egress node, 
it computes a path from itself to the backup egress node and sets up a backup
    LSP along the path for protecting the primary egress node according to the
    information in the FAST_REROUTE object in the Path message. For example,
    if facility protection is desired, it is provided for the primary egress node.</t>

    <t>The upstream node constructs a new SERO based on the SERO received 
and adds the new SERO into the Path message for the backup LSP. 
The new SERO also contains three subobjects as the SERO for the 
primary LSP. 
The first subobject in the new SERO indicates the upstream node,
which may be copied from the first subobject in the SERO received.
The second subobject in the new SERO includes a primary egress node, 
which indicates the address of the primary egress node.
The third one contains the backup egress node.</t>

    <t>The upstream node updates the SERO in the Path message for the primary LSP. The Egress Protection subobject in the SERO contains a subobject called 
a P2P LSP ID subobject, 
which contains the information for identifying the backup LSP. 
The final subobject in the SERO indicates the address of the backup egress node.</t>

<section title="Egress Protection Behaviors">
<section title="Ingress Behavior" anchor="ingress_behavior">

<t>
To protect a primary egress node of an LSP,
the ingress node MUST set the "label recording desired" flag

If one-to-one backup or facility backup is desired 
to protect a primary egress node of an LSP,
the ingress node MUST include a FAST_REROUTE object and set 
the "one-to-one backup desired" or "facility backup desired" flag,
respectively.

</t>

<t>
The ingress node MUST send a Path message for the LSP with the objects 
above and the SEROs for protecting
egress nodes of the LSP if protection of the egress nodes is desired. 
For each primary egress node of the LSP to be protected, 
the ingress node MUST add an SERO object into 
the Path message if the backup egress node, or some options, are given. 
If the backup egress node is given, 
then the final subobject in the SERO contains it;
otherwise, the address in the final subobject is zero.
</t>


</section>


<section title="Primary Egress Behavior" anchor="primary_egress_behavior">

<t>
To protect a primary egress node of an LSP,
a backup egress node MUST be configured on the primary egress node of the LSP
to protect the primary egress node
if and only if the backup egress node is not configured 
on the ingress node of the LSP (refer to <xref target="ingress_behavior"/>).
 
</t>

<t>
If the backup egress node is configured on the primary egress node of the LSP, 
the primary egress node MUST send its upstream node 
a Resv message for the LSP with an SERO for protecting the primary egress node. 
It sets the flags in the SERO in the same way as an ingress node. 
</t>

<t>If the LSP carries the service traffic with a service label, the primary egress node sends its corresponding backup egress node 
the information about the service label as a UA label (refer to <xref target="RFC5331"/>) 
and the related forwarding.</t>

</section>


<section title="Backup Egress Behavior">
    <t>When a backup egress node receives a Path message for an LSP, it
    determines whether the LSP is used for egress local protection by 
    checking the SERO with an Egress Protection subobject in the message.
If there is an Egress Protection subobject in the Path message for the LSP and the "egress local protection" flag in the object is set to 1, 
the LSP is the backup LSP for local protection of an egress node. The primary egress node to be protected is in the primary egress subobject in the SERO.
</t>

    <t>When the backup egress node receives the information about a UA label and its related forwarding from the primary egress node, it uses the backup LSP label as a context label and creates a forwarding entry using the information about the UA label and the related forwarding. This forwarding entry is in a forwarding table for the primary egress node.</t>

    <t>When the primary egress node fails, its upstream node switches the
    traffic from the primary LSP to the backup LSP to the backup egress node,
    which delivers the traffic to its receiver, such as a CE, using the backup LSP
    label as a context label to get the forwarding table for the primary
    egress node and using the service label as a UA label to find the forwarding entry
    in the table to forward the traffic to the receiver.</t>
</section>


<section title="Transit Node and PLR Behavior">

<t>
If a transit node of an LSP receives the Path message 
with the SEROs and 
it is not an upstream node of any primary egress node of the LSP 
as a branch node, 
it MUST forward them unchanged.  
</t>

<t>
If the transit node is the upstream node 
of a primary egress node to be protected as a branch node, 
it determines the backup egress node, obtains a path for the backup LSP,
and sets up the backup LSP along the path.
If the upstream node receives the Resv message with an SERO object,
it MUST send its upstream node the Resv message without the object.
</t>

<t>
The PLR (which is the upstream node of the primary egress node a.k.a. the
branch node) MUST extract the backup egress node from the respective SERO
object in either a Path or a Resv message.
If no matching SERO object is found, 
the PLR tries to find the backup egress node,
which is not the primary egress node but 
has the same IP address as the destination IP address of the LSP.
</t>

<t>
Note that if a backup egress node is not configured explicitly for protecting a primary egress node, 
the primary egress node and the backup egress node 
SHOULD have the same local address configured, and
the cost to the local address on the backup egress node SHOULD be much bigger than
the cost to the local address on the primary egress node.

Thus, the primary egress node and backup egress node are considered as a "virtual node".

Note that
the backup egress node is different from this local address 
(e.g., from the primary egress node's point of view). 
In other words, 
it is identified by an address different from this local address.
</t>

<t>
After obtaining the backup egress node, 
the PLR computes a backup path from itself to the backup egress node
and sets up a backup LSP along the path.
It excludes the segment including the primary egress node to be protected when computing the path. 

The PLR sends the primary egress node a Path message with
an SERO for the primary LSP, 
which indicates the backup egress node by the final subobject in the SERO.
The PLR puts an SERO into the Path messages for the backup LSP,
which indicates the primary egress node.
</t>

<t>
The PLR MUST provide one-to-one backup protection for the primary egress node
if the "one-to-one backup desired" flag is set in the message; otherwise,
it MUST provide facility backup protection 
if the "facility backup desired" flag is set.
</t>

<t>
The PLR MUST set the protection flags in the RRO subobject 
for the primary egress node in the Resv message according to the status of  
the primary egress node and the backup LSP protecting the primary egress node.
For example, it sets the "local protection available" flag and the "node protection" flag, 
which indicate that the primary egress node is protected 
when the backup LSP is up and ready to protect the primary egress node.
</t>

<section title="Signaling for One-to-One Protection">

<t>
The behavior of the upstream node of a primary egress node of an LSP
(as a PLR) is the same as that of a PLR for one-to-one backup
described in <xref target="RFC4090"/>, except that the upstream node (as a PLR)
creates a backup LSP from itself to a backup egress node
in a session different from the primary LSP.
</t>

<t>
If the LSP is a P2MP LSP and 
a primary egress node of the LSP is also a transit node
(i.e., bud node),
the upstream node of the primary egress node (as a PLR) 
creates a backup LSP from itself to each of the next hops of the
primary egress node.
</t>

<t>
When the PLR detects the failure of the primary egress node,
it switches the packets from the primary LSP 
to the backup LSP to the backup egress node.
For the failure of the bud node of a P2MP LSP, 
the PLR also switches the packets to the backup LSPs
to the bud node's next hops, where the packets are merged into the 
primary LSP.
</t>

</section>


<section title="Signaling for Facility Protection">

<t>
Except for backup LSP and downstream label,
the behavior of the upstream node of the primary egress node of a primary LSP 
(as a PLR) follows the PLR behavior for facility backup, which is described in <xref target="RFC4090"/>.
</t>

<t>
For a number of primary P2P LSPs going through the same PLR to the same 
primary egress node,
the primary egress node of these LSPs MAY be protected 
by one backup LSP from the PLR to the backup egress node 
designated for protecting the primary egress node.
</t>

<t>
The PLR selects or creates a backup LSP from itself to the backup egress node.

If there is a backup LSP 
that satisfies the constraints given in the Path message,
then this one is selected;
otherwise, a new backup LSP to the backup egress node is created.
</t>


<t>
After getting the backup LSP,
the PLR associates the backup LSP with a primary LSP for protecting
its primary egress node.
The PLR records that the backup LSP is used to protect 
the primary LSP against its primary egress node failure and MUST
include an SERO object
in the Path message for the primary LSP.
The object MUST contain the backup LSP ID.

It indicates 
that the primary egress node MUST send the backup egress node
the service label as a UA label and also send the information about forwarding 
the traffic to its destination using the label
if there is a service carried by the LSP and  
the primary LSP label as a UA label 
(if the label is not implicit null). 


How a UA label is sent is out of scope for this document
(refer to <xref target="FRAMEWK"/>).
</t>

<t>
When the PLR detects the failure of the primary egress node,
it redirects the packets from the primary LSP into the backup LSP 
to the backup egress node and keeps the primary LSP label from the primary egress node 
in the label stack if the label is not implicit null. 

The backup egress node delivers the packets
to the same destinations as the primary egress node using the backup LSP label
as a context label and the labels under as UA labels.
</t>

</section>


<section title="Signaling for S2L Sub-LSP Protection">
<t>
The S2L sub-LSP protection
uses an S2L sub-LSP (refer to <xref target="RFC4875"/>) as a backup LSP to 
protect a primary egress node of a P2MP LSP.

The PLR MUST determine to protect a primary egress node of a P2MP LSP
via S2L sub-LSP protection when it receives a Path message with the "S2L sub-LSP backup desired" flag set.
</t>

<t>
The PLR MUST set up the backup S2L sub-LSP to the backup egress node and create and
maintain its state in the same way as if setting up a S2L sub-LSP defined in
<xref target="RFC4875"/> from the signaling's point of view. 
It computes a path for the backup LSP from itself to the backup egress node,
constructs and sends a Path message along the path, and receives and processes a Resv message responding to the
Path message.
</t>

<t>
After receiving the Resv message for the backup LSP, 
the PLR creates a forwarding entry with an inactive state or flag 
called "inactive forwarding entry".
This inactive forwarding entry is not used to forward any data
traffic during normal operations.
</t>

<t>
When the PLR detects the failure of the primary egress node, 
it changes the forwarding entry for the backup LSP to "active". Thus,
the PLR forwards the traffic to the
backup egress through the backup LSP, which sends the traffic to its
destination.
</t>
</section>


<section title="PLR Procedures during Local Repair">

<t>
When the upstream node of a primary egress node of an LSP (as a PLR) 
detects the failure of the primary egress node, 
it follows the procedures defined in Section 6.5 of <xref target="RFC4090"/>.

It SHOULD notify the ingress node about the failure of the primary egress node in 
the same way as a PLR notifies the ingress node about the failure of 
a transit node.
</t>

<t>
Moreover, the PLR MUST let the upstream part of the primary LSP stay alive
after the primary egress node fails by 
sending the Resv message to its upstream node along the primary LSP. 
The downstream part of the primary LSP 
from the PLR to the primary egress node SHOULD be removed.
When a bypass LSP from the PLR to a backup egress node protects the primary egress node,
the PLR MUST NOT send any Path message for the primary LSP
through the bypass LSP to the backup egress node.
</t>

<t>
In the local revertive mode, the PLR will re-signal each of the primary LSPs
that were routed over the restored resource 
once it detects that the resource is restored.
Every primary LSP successfully re-signaled along the restored resource 
will be switched back.
</t>

<t>Note that 
the procedure for protecting the primary egress node is triggered on the PLR 
if the primary egress node failure is determined. 
If link (from PLR to primary egress node) failure and primary egress node alive 
are determined,
then the link protection procedure is triggered on the PLR. 
How to determine these is out of scope for this document.

<section title="Application Traffic Considerations">
<t>
This section focuses on an example with application traffic 
carried by P2P LSPs.
</t>

<section title="A Typical Application">
<t>
L3VPN is a typical application. 
<xref target="L3VPN-Egress-Protect"/> below shows a simple VPN that consists of two CEs, CE1 and CE2, 
connected to two PEs, R1 and L1, respectively.
There is a P2P LSP from R1 to L1, which is represented by stars (****).
This LSP is called the primary LSP.
R1 is the ingress node of the LSP and L1 is the (primary) egress node of the LSP. 
R1 sends the VPN traffic received from CE1 through the P2P LSP 
to L1, which delivers the traffic to CE2.
R1 sends the VPN traffic with an LSP label and a VPN label via the LSP.
When the traffic reaches the egress node L1 of the LSP,  
L1 pops the LSP label and uses the VPN label to deliver the traffic 
to CE2.
</t> 

<t>In previous solutions based on ingress protection to 
protect the VPN traffic against failure of the egress node L1 of
the LSP, when the egress node fails, the ingress node R1 of the LSP does
the reroute (refer to <xref target="L3VPN-Egress-Protect"/>). This solution entailed:

<list style="numbers"> 
  <t>A multi-hop BFD session between ingress node R1 and egress node L1 of the primary LSP. 
The BFD session is represented by dots (....).</t>

  <t>A backup LSP from ingress node R1 to backup egress node La, 
which is indicated by ampersands (&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;).</t>

  <t>La sends R1 a VPN backup label and related information via BGP.</t>

  <t>R1 has a VRF with two sets of routes for CE2: 
one set uses the primary LSP and L1 as the next hop; 
the other uses the backup LSP and La as the next hop.</t>
</list>

</t>

<t>
In normal operations, R1 sends the VPN traffic from CE1 through 
the primary LSP with the VPN label received from L1 as the inner label
to L1, which delivers the traffic to CE2 using the VPN label.
</t>

<t>
When R1 detects the failure of L1,
R1 sends the traffic from CE1 via 
the backup LSP with the VPN backup label received from La as the inner label
to La, which delivers the traffic to CE2 using the VPN backup label.
</t>


<t>
The solution defined in this document that uses egress local protection 
for protecting L3VPN traffic entails (refer to <xref target="L3VPN-Egress-Local-Protect"/>):
<list style="numbers"> 
  <t>A BFD session between R3 (i.e., upstream node of L1) and egress node L1 
of the primary LSP. 
This is different from the BFD session in <xref
target="L3VPN-Egress-Protect"/>, which is a multi-hop 
between ingress node R1 and egress node L1.
The PLR R3 is closer to L1 than the ingress node R1. 
It may detect the failure of the egress node L1 faster and more reliably.
Therefore, this solution can provide faster protection 
for failure of an egress node.
</t>

  <t>A backup LSP from R3 to backup egress node La. This is different from 
the backup LSP in <xref target="L3VPN-Egress-Protect"/>, which is an end-to-end LSP from 
ingress node R1 to backup egress node La.</t>

  <t>Primary egress node L1 sends backup egress node La the VPN label as a UA label 
and also sends related information.
The backup egress node La uses the backup LSP label as a context label 
and creates a forwarding entry using the VPN label 
in an LFIB for the primary egress node L1.</t>

  <t>L1 and La are virtualized as one node (or address). 
R1 has a VRF with one set of routes for CE2, 
using the primary LSP from R1 to L1 and a virtualized node as the next hop. 
This can be achieved by configuring the same local address on L1 and La using  
the address as a destination of the LSP and BGP next hop for the VPN traffic. 
The cost to L1 is configured to be less than the cost to La.</t>

and the VPN label as a UA label to find the forwarding entry in the LFIB

</section>


<section title="PLR Procedure for Applications">
<t>
When the PLR gets a backup LSP from itself to a backup egress node
for protecting a primary egress node of a primary LSP,
it includes an SERO object in the Path message 
for the primary LSP. 
The object contains the ID information of the backup LSP and
indicates that the primary egress node sends the backup egress node 
the application traffic label (e.g., the VPN label) as a UA label  
when needed. 
</t>
</section>


<section title="Egress Procedures for Applications">

<t>
When a primary egress node of an LSP sends the ingress node of the LSP
a label for an application such as a VPN label, 
it sends the label (as a UA label) to the backup egress node for protecting the primary egress node.
Exactly how the label is sent is out of scope for this document.
</t>

<t>
When the backup egress node receives a UA label from 
the primary egress node, 
it adds a forwarding entry with the label into the LFIB 
for the primary egress node. 

When the backup egress node receives a packet from the backup LSP, 
it uses the top label as a context label to find the LFIB for 
the primary egress node and uses the inner label to deliver the packet 
to the same destination as the primary egress node according to the LFIB.

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>
This document builds upon existing work, specifically, the security
considerations of <xref target="RFC4090"/>, <xref target="RFC4875"/>, <xref target="RFC3209"/>, and <xref target="RFC2205"/> continue to apply.  

Additionally, 
protecting a primary egress node of a P2P LSP carrying service
traffic through a backup egress node requires out-of-band 
communication between the primary egress node and the backup egress node
in order for the primary egress node to convey a service label 
as a UA label and also convey its related forwarding information to the
backup egress node. 
 
It is important to confirm that the identifiers used to identify
the primary and backup egress nodes in the LSP are verified 
to match with the identifiers used in the out-of-band protocol 
(such as BGP).

<abstract><t>This document specifies a fast reroute framework for protecting IP/ MPLS services and MPLS transport tunnels against egress node and egress link failures.  In this framework, the penultimate-hop router of an MPLS tunnel acts as the point of local repair (PLR) for egress node failure, and the egress router of the MPLS tunnel acts as the PLR for egress link failure.  Each of them pre-establishes a bypass tunnel to a protector.  Upon an egress node or link failure, the corresponding PLR performs local failure detection and local repair, by rerouting packets over the corresponding bypass tunnel.  The protector in turn performs context label switching or context IP forwarding to send the packets to the ultimate service destination(s).  This mechanism can be used to reduce traffic loss before global repair reacts to the failure and control plane protocols converge on the topology changes due to the failure.  The framework is applicable to all types of IP/MPLS services and MPLS tunnels.  Under the framework, service protocol extensions may be further specified to support service label distribution to the protector.</t></abstract>
