      <abstract>
         <t>Mobile IPv6 signaling between a Mobile Node (MN) and its Home
            Agent (HA) is secured using IPsec. The security association (SA)
            between an MN and the HA is established
            using Internet Key Exchange Protocol (IKE) version 1 or 2. The security model specified for
            Mobile IPv6, which relies on IKE/IPsec, requires
            interaction between the Mobile IPv6 protocol component 
            and the IKE/IPsec module of the IP stack. This document
proposes an alternate security framework for Mobile IPv6 and
Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6, which relies on Transport 
            Layer Security for establishing keying material and other
            bootstrapping parameters required to protect Mobile
            IPv6 signaling and data traffic between the MN
            and HA. </t>

      <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
         <t>Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) <xref target="RFC6275"/> signaling, and optionally user
   traffic, between a Mobile Node (MN) and Home Agent (HA) are secured
   by IPsec <xref target="RFC4301"/>.  The current Mobile IPv6
   security architecture is specified in <xref target="RFC3776"/> and
   <xref target="RFC4877"/>.  This security model requires a tight
   coupling between the Mobile IPv6 protocol part and the
   IKE(v2)/IPsec part of the IP stack. Client implementation experience 
   has shown that the use of IKE(v2)/IPsec with Mobile IPv6 is fairly
   complex.  
		</t>
         <t>This document proposes an alternate security framework for Mobile
   IPv6 and Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6.  The objective is to simplify
   implementations as well as make it easy to deploy the protocol
   without compromising on security.  Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   <xref target="RFC5246"/> is widely implemented in almost all major
   operating systems and extensively used by various applications.
   Instead of using IKEv2 to establish security associations, the
   security framework proposed in this document is based on TLS-protected messages to exchange keys and bootstrapping parameters
   between the MN and a new functional entity called the
   "Home Agent Controller" (HAC).  The Mobile IPv6 signaling between the
   mobile node and home agent is subsequently secured using the
   resulting keys and negotiated ciphersuite.  The HAC can be
   co-located with the HA, or it can be an independent entity.  For the
   latter case, communication between the HAC and HA is not defined by
   this document.  Such communication could be built on top of AAA
   protocols such as Diameter.  
		</t> 
		 <t>The primary
  advantage of using TLS for the establishment of Mobile IPv6
  security associations as compared to the use of IKEv2 is the ease
  of implementation (especially on the mobile nodes) while providing
  an equivalent level of security. A solution which decouples Mobile
  IPv6 security from IPsec, for securing signaling messages and user
  plane traffic, is proposed herein that reduces client
  implementation complexity.
		</t>
		 <t>The security framework proposed in this document is not intended to
   replace the currently specified architecture that relies on IPsec
   and IKEv2.  It provides an alternative solution that is more optimal
   for certain deployment scenarios. This and other alternative
   security models have been considered by the MEXT working group at
   the IETF, and it has been decided that the alternative solutions
   should be published as Experimental RFCs, so that more
   implementation and deployment experience with these models can be
   gathered. The
  status of this proposal may be reconsidered in the future if it
  becomes clear that it is superior to others.

      <section title="Background">
         <t>Mobile IPv6 design and specification began in the mid-to-late
   90s. The security architecture of Mobile IPv6 was based on the
   understanding that IPsec is an inherent and integral part of the
   IPv6 stack and any protocol that needs security should use IPsec
   unless there is a good reason not to.  As a result of this mindset,
   the Mobile IP6 protocol relied on the use of IPsec for security
   between the MN and HA.  Reusing security components
  that are an integral part of the IP stack is a good design
  objective for any protocol; however, in the case of Mobile IPv6, it
  increases implementation complexity. It should be noted that
   Mobile IPv4 <xref target="RFC5944"/>, for example, does not use IPsec
   for security and instead has specified its own security solution.
   Mobile IPv4 has been implemented and deployed on a reasonably large
   scale and the security model has proven itself to be sound.  
         </t>
         <t>Mobile IPv6 standardization was completed in 2005 along with the
   security architecture using IKE/IPsec specified in RFC 3776 <xref
   target="RFC3776"/>.  With the evolution to IKEv2 <xref
   target="RFC5996"/>, Mobile IPv6 security has also been updated to
   rely on the use of IKEv2 <xref target="RFC4877"/>. Implementation
   exercises of Mobile IPv6 and Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 <xref
   target="RFC5555"/> have identified the complexity of using IPsec
   and IKEv2 in conjunction with Mobile IPv6. Implementing Mobile IPv6
   with IPsec and IKEv2 requires modifications to both the IPsec and
   IKEv2 components, due to the communication models that Mobile IPv6
   uses and the changing IP addresses. For further details, see
   Section 7.1 in <xref target="RFC3776"/>. 
         </t>
         <t>This document proposes a security
  framework based on TLS-protected establishment of Mobile IPv6
  security associations, which reduces implementation complexity while
  maintaining an equivalent (to IKEv2/IPsec) level of security.

   <t>
   
   The
  security architecture proposed in this document relies on a secure
  TLS session established between the MN and the HAC for mutual
  authentication and MN-HA security association bootstrapping.
   Authentication of the HAC is done via standard TLS operation wherein
  the HAC uses a TLS server certificate as its credentials.  MN
  authentication is done by the HAC via signaling messages that are
  secured by the TLS connection.  Any Extensible Authentication
  Protocol (EAP) method or Pre-Shared Key (PSK) can be used for
  authenticating the MN to the HAC. Upon successful completion of
  authentication, the HAC generates keys that are delivered to the MN
   through the secure TLS channel.  The same keys are also provided to
   the assigned HA. The HAC also provides the MN with MIPv6
   bootstrapping information such as the IPv6 and IPv4 address of the
   HA, the home network prefix, the IPv6 and/or IPv4 Home Address (HoA), and DNS
   server address.
   </t>
   <t>	
   The MN and HA use security associations based on the keys and Security Parameter Indexes (SPIs) generated by the HAC and delivered to the MN and HA to secure
   signaling and optionally user plane traffic.  <xref target="arch-hl"/> below is an illustration of the process.	 		
   </t>
   <t>Signaling messages and user plane traffic between the MN and HA are
   always UDP encapsulated. The packet formats for the signaling and
   user plane traffic is described in Sections <xref target="bmmmsg" format="counter"/> and <xref target="dtamsg" format="counter"/>.

            <t>Once the MN has contacted the HAC and mutual authentication has

        <section title="Request-Response Message Framing over TLS-Tunnel" anchor="record">
          <t>The MN and the HAC communicate with each other using a simple
             lockstep request-response protocol that is run inside the protected TLS-tunnel.
			 A generic message container framing for the request messages and for the
			 response messages is defined. The
             message containers are only meant to be exchanged on top of a connection-oriented TLS-layer. Therefore, the end of message exchange is determined by the
             other end closing the transport connection (assuming the "application
             layer" has also indicated the completion of the message exchange).
             The peer initiating the TLS connection is
             always sending "Requests", and the peer accepting the TLS connection
             is always sending "Responses". The format of the message container
             is shown in <xref target="container"/>.
          </t>
          <t>All data inside the Content portion of the message container MUST be
             encoded using octets. Fragmentation of message containers is not supported,
             which means one request or response at the "application layer"
             MUST NOT exceed the maximum size allowed by the message container
             format.

          <t>During the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping, the MN and the HAC negotiate
             a single ciphersuite for protecting the traffic between the MN and
             the HA. The allowed ciphersuites for this specification are a
             subset of those in TLS version 1.2 (see Appendix A.5 of <xref target="RFC5246"/>)
             per <xref target="ciphersuite"/>. This might appear as a
             constraint as the HA and the HAC may have implemented different
             ciphersuites. These two nodes are, however, assumed to belong to
             the same administrative domain. In order to avoid exchanging
             supported MN-HA ciphersuites in the MN-HAC protocol and to reuse
             the TLS ciphersuite negotiation procedure, we make this simplifying
             assumption. The selected ciphersuite MUST provide integrity and
             confidentiality protection.
          </t>
          <t><xref target="ciphersuite"/> provides the mapping from  the TLS
             ciphersuites to the integrity and encryption algorithms allowed
             for MN-HA protection. This mapping mainly ignores the
             authentication algorithm part that is not required within the
             context of this specification. For example, <xref target="RFC5246"/>
             defines a number of AES-based ciphersuites for TLS including
             'TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA'. For this specification, the
             relevant part is 'AES_128_CBC_SHA'. 
          </t>
          <t>All the parameters described in the following sections apply only
             to a request-response protocol response message to the MN. The MN has
             no way of affecting the provisioning decision of the HAC.

       <section title="Authentication of the Mobile Node" anchor="AUTH-MN">
         <t>This section describes the basic operation required for the MN-HAC
            mutual authentication and the channel binding.  The authentication
            protocol described as part of this section is a simple exchange that
            follows the Generalized Pre-Shared Key (GPSK) exchange used by EAP-GPSK <xref target="RFC5433"/>.
            It is secured by the TLS tunnel and is cryptographically bound to
            the TLS tunnel through channel binding based on <xref target="RFC5056"/>
            and on the channel binding type 'tls-server-endpoint' described in
            <xref target="RFC5929"/>. As a result of
            the channel binding type, this method can only be used with TLS
            ciphersuites that use server certificates and the Certificate
            handshake message. For example, TLS ciphersuites based on PSK or
            anonymous authentication cannot be used.
         </t>
         <t>The authentication exchange MUST be performed through the encrypted
            TLS tunnel.  It performs mutual authentication between the MN and
            the HAC based on a PSK or based on an EAP-method
            (see <xref target="eap-method"/>). Note that an HAC MUST NOT allow MNs to renegotiate TLS sessions. The PSK protocol is described
            in this section. It consists of the message exchanges (MHAuth-Init,
            MHAuth-Mid, MHAuth-Done) in which both sides exchange nonces and
            their identities, and compute and exchange
            a message authenticator 'auth' over the previously exchanged
            values, keyed with the pre-shared key.  The MHAuth-Done messages
            are used to deal with error situations. Key binding with the TLS
            tunnel is ensured by channel binding of the type "tls-server-endpoint"
            as described by <xref target="RFC5929"/>
            where the hash of the TLS server certificate serves as input to
            the 'auth' calculation of the MHAuth messages.
         </t>
         <t>Note: The authentication exchange is based on the GPSK exchange
            used by EAP-GPSK. In comparison to GPSK, it does not support
            exchanging an encrypted container (it always runs through an
            already protected TLS tunnel). Furthermore, the initial request
            of the authentication exchange (MHAuth-Init) is sent by the MN
            (client side) and is comparable to EAP-Response/Identity, which
            reverses the roles of request and response messages compared to
            EAP-GPSK. <xref target="psk"/> shows a successful protocol
            exchange.

          <t>The shared secret PSK can be variable length. 'msg-octets'
             includes all payload parameters of the respective message to be
             signed except the 'auth' payload. CB-octets is the channel binding
             input to the auth calculation that is the "TLS-server-endpoint"
             channel binding type. The content and algorithm (only required
             for the "TLS-server-endpoint" type) are the same as described in
             <xref target="RFC5929"/>.
          </t>
          <t>The MN starts by selecting a random number 'mn-rand' and choosing
             a list of supported authentication methods coded in 'auth-method'.
             The MN sends its identity 'mn-id', 'mn-rand', and 'auth-method' to
             the HAC in MHAuth-Init. The decision of which authentication method
             to offer and  which to pick is policy and implementation dependent
             and, therefore, outside the scope of this document.
          </t>
          <t>In MHAuth-Done, the HAC sends a random
             number 'hac-rand' and the selected ciphersuite. The
             selection MUST be one of the MN-supported ciphersuites as received
             in 'ciphersuite-list'. Furthermore, it repeats the received parameters
             of the MHAuth-Init message 'mn-rand'. It
             computes a message authenticator 'auth' over all the transmitted
             parameters except 'auth' itself. The HAC calculates 'auth' over all
             parameters and appends it to the message.
          </t>
          <t>The MN verifies the received Message Authentication Code (MAC) and the consistency of the
             identities, nonces, and ciphersuite parameters transmitted in
             MHAuth-Auth. In case of successful verification, the MN computes
             a MAC over the session parameter and returns it to the HAC in
             MHAuth-Done. The HAC verifies the received MAC and the consistency
             of the identities, nonces, and ciphersuite parameters transmitted
             in MHAuth-Init.  If the verification is successful, MHAuth-Done
             is prepared and sent by the HAC to confirm successful completion
             of the exchange.

     <section title="Mobile Node to Home Agent Communication">
       <section title="General" anchor="packets">
            <t>The following subsections describe the packet formats used for the traffic between the
               MN and the HA. This traffic includes binding management messages (for example, BU
               and BA messages), reverse-tunneled and encrypted user data, and reverse-tunneled
               plaintext user data. This specification defines a generic packet format, where
               everything is encapsulated inside UDP. See Sections <xref target="bmmmsg" format="counter"/> and <xref
                  target="dtamsg" format="counter"/> for detailed illustrations of the corresponding packet formats.
            </t>
            
            <t>The Mobile IPv6 service port number is where the HA expects to receive UDP
               packets. The same
               port number is used for both binding management messages and user data packets. The
               reason for multiplexing data and control messages over the same port number is due to
               the possibility of Network Address and Port Translators located along the path
               between the MN and the HA. The Mobile IPv6 service MAY use any ephemeral port number
               as the UDP source port, and it MUST use the Mobile IPv6 service port number as the UDP destination port. The Mobile IPv6 service port is dynamically assigned to the MN during the bootstrapping phase (i.e., the mip6-port parameter) or, in absence of the bootstrapping parameter, the IANA reserved port (mipv6tls) MUST be used.
            </t>
            <t>The encapsulating UDP header is immediately followed by a 4-bit
               Packet Type (PType) field that defines whether the packet
               contains an encrypted mobility management message, an encrypted
               user data packet, or a plaintext user data packet.
            </t>
            <t>The Packet Type field is followed by a 28-bit SPI value, which
               identifies the correct SA concerning the encrypted packet. For
               any packet that is neither integrity protected nor encrypted (i.e.,
               no SA is applied by the originator), the SPI MUST be set to 0 (zero). Mobility management messages MUST always be at least
               integrity protected. Hence, mobility management messages MUST
               NOT be sent with an SPI value of 0 (zero).   
            </t>
            <t>There is always only one SPI per MN-HA mobility session and the
               same SPI is used for all types of protected packets independent
               of the direction.
            </t>
            <t>The SPI value is followed by a 32-bit Sequence Number value that
               is used to identify retransmissions of protected messages (integrity protected or both integrity protected and
             encrypted, see Figures <xref target="ptype8" format="counter"/> and <xref target="ptype1" format="counter"/>) . Each
               endpoint in the security association maintains two "current"
               Sequence Numbers: the next one to be used for a packet it 
               initiates and the next one it expects to see in a packet from
               the other end. If the MN and the HA ends initiate very different
               numbers of messages, the Sequence Numbers in the two directions
               can be very different. In the case data protection is not used (see <xref target="ptype0"/>), the
               Sequence Number MUST be set to 0 (zero). Note that the HA SHOULD
               initiate a re-establishment of the SA before any of the Sequence
               Number cycle.
            </t>
            <t>Finally, the Sequence Number field is followed by the data
               portion, whose content is identified by the Packet Type. The
               data portion may be protected.
            </t>
        </section>
        <section title="PType and Security Parameter Index">
         <t>The PType is a 4-bit field that indicates the Packet Type (PType)
            of the UDP encapsulated packet. The PType is followed by  
             a 28-bit SPI value. The PType and the SPI fields are treated as
             one 32-bit field during the integrity protection calculation.

        <section title="Reverse-Tunneled User Data Packet Formats" anchor="dtamsg">
               <t>There are two types of reverse-tunneled user data packets between the
  MN and the HA: those that are integrity protected and/or encrypted and
  those that are sent in the clear.  The MN or the HA decides whether to
apply
  integrity protection and/or encryption to a packet or to send it in
  the clear based on the mip6-sas value in the SA. If the mip6-sas is
  set to 1, the originator MUST NOT send any user data packets in the
  clear, and the receiver MUST silently discard any packet with the
  PType set to 0 (unprotected).  It is RECOMMENDED that
  confidentiality and integrity protection of user data traffic be
  applied. The reverse-tunneled IPv4 or IPv6 user data packets are encapsulated
                  as is inside the 'Payload Data' shown in Figures <xref target="ptype1" format="counter"/>
                  and <xref target="ptype0" format="counter"/>.

                     The client-side authentication may depend on the

                     that TLS-PSK <xref target="RFC4279"/> cannot be used in

</t><t>
                     Through the protected TLS tunnel, an additional
                     authentication exchange is performed that provides
                     client-side or mutual authentication and exchanges SA
                     parameters and optional configuration data to be used in
                     the subsequent protection of MN-HA communication. The
                     additional authentication exchange can be either PSK-based
                     (<xref target="AUTH-MN" />) or EAP-based (<xref target="eap-method" />). Both exchanges
                     are always performed within the protected TLS tunnel and
                     MUST NOT be used as standalone protocols.
</t><t>
                     The simple PSK-based authentication exchange provides
                     mutual authentication and follows the GPSK exchange used
                     by EAP-GPSK <xref target="RFC5433"/> and has similar
                     properties, although some features of GPSK like the
                     exchange of a protected container are not supported.                     <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                     The EAP-based authentication exchange simply defines
                     message containers to allow carrying the EAP packets
                     between the MN and the HAC. In principle, any EAP method
                     can be used. However, it is strongly recommended to use
                     only EAP methods that provide mutual authentication and
                     that derive keys including an MSK in compliance with
                     <xref target="RFC3748"/>. 
</t><t>
                     Both exchanges use channel binding with the TLS tunnel.
                     The channel binding type 'TLS-server-endpoint' per
