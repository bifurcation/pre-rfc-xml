         This document describes the protocol for the TCP-based

<section title="Introduction">


<t>
   This document describes the TCP-based convergence-layer protocol for
   Delay-Tolerant Networking. Delay-Tolerant Networking is an
   end-to-end architecture providing communications in and/or through
   highly stressed environments, including those with intermittent
   connectivity, long and/or variable delays, and high bit error
   rates. More detailed descriptions of the rationale and capabilities
   of these networks can be found in <xref target="RFC4838">
   "Delay-Tolerant Network Architecture"</xref>.
</t>


<t>
   An important goal of the DTN architecture is to accommodate a wide
   range of networking technologies and environments. The protocol
   used for DTN communications is the <xref target="RFC5050">
   Bundle Protocol (BP)</xref>, an application-layer protocol that
   is used to construct a store-and-forward overlay network. As
   described in the Bundle Protocol specification <xref target="RFC5050" />, it requires the
   services of a "convergence-layer adapter" (CLA) to send and receive
   bundles using the service of some "native" link, network, or Internet
   protocol. This document describes one such convergence-layer adapter that
   uses the well-known Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  This convergence
   layer is referred to as TCPCL.
</t>

<t>
   The locations of the TCPCL and the BP in the Internet model protocol
   stack are shown in <xref target="fig:protocol_stack"/>. In particular, when
   BP is using TCP as its bearer with TCPCL as its convergence layer, both BP
   and TCPCL reside at the application layer of the Internet model.

      established for the purposes of bundle communication. A TCPCL connection is
      terminated when the TCP connection ends, due either to one or

<section title="General Protocol Description" anchor="sec:general_description">

<t>
  The service of this protocol is the transmission of DTN bundles over TCP. This
  document specifies the encapsulation of bundles, procedures for TCP setup and
  teardown, and a set of messages and node requirements.  The general operation
  of the protocol is as follows.
</t>

<t>
   First, one node establishes a TCPCL connection to the other by
   initiating a TCP connection.  After setup of the TCP connection is
   complete, an initial contact header is exchanged in both directions
   to set parameters of the TCPCL connection and exchange a singleton
   endpoint identifier for each node (not the singleton Endpoint Identifier (EID) of any
   application running on the node) to denote the bundle-layer
   identity of each DTN node.  This is used to assist in routing and
   forwarding messages, e.g., to prevent loops.
</t>

<t>
   Once the TCPCL connection is established and configured in this
   way, bundles can be transmitted in either direction.  Each bundle
   is transmitted in one or more logical segments of formatted bundle
   data.  Each logical data segment consists of a DATA_SEGMENT message
   header, a Self-Delimiting Numeric Value (SDNV) as defined in <xref
   target="RFC5050"/> (see also <xref target="RFC6256"/>) containing the length of the
   segment, and finally
   the byte range of the bundle data. The choice of the length to use
   for segments is an implementation matter.  The first segment for a
   bundle must set the 'start' flag, and the last one must set the
   'end' flag in the DATA_SEGMENT message header.
</t>
<t>
   If multiple bundles are transmitted on a single TCPCL connection, they MUST
   be transmitted consecutively. Interleaving data segments from different
   bundles is not allowed. Bundle interleaving can be accomplished by
   fragmentation at the BP layer.
</t>
<t>
   An optional feature of the protocol is for the receiving node to
   send acknowledgments as bundle data segments arrive (ACK_SEGMENT).
   The rationale behind these acknowledgments is to enable the sender
   node to determine how much of the bundle has been received, so that
   in case the connection is interrupted, it can perform reactive
   fragmentation to avoid re-sending the already transmitted part of
   the bundle.
</t>
<t>
   When acknowledgments are enabled, then for each data segment that
   is received, the receiving node sends an ACK_SEGMENT code followed
   by an SDNV containing the cumulative length of the bundle that has
   been received. The sending node may transmit multiple DATA_SEGMENT messages
   without necessarily waiting for the corresponding ACK_SEGMENT responses.
   This enables pipelining of messages on a channel. In addition, there is no
   explicit flow control on the TCPCL layer.
</t>
<t>
   Another optional feature is that a receiver may interrupt the
   transmission of a bundle at any point in time by replying with a
   REFUSE_BUNDLE message, which causes the sender to
   stop transmission of the current bundle, after completing
   transmission of a partially sent data segment.  Note: This enables
   a cross-layer optimization in that it
   allows a receiver that detects that it already has received a certain
   bundle to interrupt transmission as early as possible and thus save
   transmission capacity for other bundles.
</t>
<t>
   For connections that are idle, a KEEPALIVE message may optionally
   be sent at a negotiated interval.  This is used to convey liveness
   information.
</t>
<t>
   Finally, before connections close, a SHUTDOWN message is sent on
   the channel.  After sending a SHUTDOWN message, the sender of this
   message may send further acknowledgments (ACK_SEGMENT or
   REFUSE_BUNDLE) but no further data messages (DATA_SEGMENT).  A
   SHUTDOWN message may also be used to refuse a connection setup by a
   peer.
</t>

<section title="Bidirectional Use of TCP Connection">

  <t>There are specific messages for sending and receiving operations
    (in addition to connection setup/teardown).  TCPCL is symmetric, i.e., both
    sides can start sending data segments in a connection, and one side's bundle
    transfer does not have to complete before the other side can start sending
    data segments on its own. Hence, the protocol allows for a bi-directional
    mode of communication.</t>

  <t>Note that in the case of concurrent bidirectional transmission, acknowledgment
    segments may be interleaved with data segments.</t>

</section>

<section title="Example Message Exchange" anchor="sec:example">

<t>
   The following figure visually depicts the protocol exchange for
   a simple session, showing the connection establishment and the
   transmission of a single bundle split into three data segments
   (of lengths L1, L2, and L3) from Node A to Node B.
</t>

<t>
   Note that the sending node may transmit multiple DATA_SEGMENT
   messages without necessarily waiting for the corresponding
   ACK_SEGMENT responses. This enables pipelining of messages on a
   channel. Although this example only demonstrates a single bundle
   transmission, it is also possible to pipeline multiple DATA_SEGMENT
   messages for different bundles without necessarily waiting for
   ACK_SEGMENT messages to be returned for each one.  However,
   interleaving data segments from different bundles is not allowed.
</t>



<t>
   No errors or rejections are shown in this example.

<section title="Connection Establishment" anchor="sec:connection_establishment">

<t>
   For bundle transmissions to occur using the TCPCL, a TCPCL
   connection must first be established between communicating nodes.
   It is up to the implementation to decide how and when connection setup is
   triggered.  For example, some connections may be opened proactively and
   maintained for as long as is possible given the network conditions, while
   other connections may be opened only when there is a bundle that is queued
   for transmission and the routing algorithm selects a certain next-hop node.
</t>

<t>
   To establish a TCPCL connection, a node must first establish a TCP
   connection with the intended peer node, typically by using the
   services provided by the operating system.  Port number 4556 has
   been assigned by IANA as the well-known port number for the TCP
   convergence layer.  Other port numbers MAY be used per local
   configuration.  Determining a peer's port number (if different
   from the well-known TCPCL port) is up to the implementation.
</t>

<t>
   If the node is unable to establish a TCP connection for any reason,
   then it is an implementation matter to determine how to handle the
   connection failure.  A node MAY decide to re-attempt to establish
   the connection.  If it does so, it MUST NOT overwhelm its
   target with repeated connection attempts.  Therefore, the node MUST
   retry the connection setup only after some delay (a 1-second minimum is
   RECOMMENDED), and it SHOULD use a (binary) exponential backoff mechanism to
   increase this delay in case of repeated failures. In case a SHUTDOWN message
   specifying a reconnection delay is received, that delay is used as the
   initial delay. The default initial delay SHOULD be at least 1 second but
   SHOULD be configurable since it will be application and network type
   dependent.
</t>

<t>
   The node MAY declare failure after one or more connection attempts
   and MAY attempt to find an alternate route for bundle data.  Such
   decisions are up to the higher layer (i.e., the BP).
</t>

<t>
   Once a TCP connection is established, each node MUST immediately transmit a
   contact header over the TCP connection.  The format of the contact header is
   described in <xref target="sec:contact_header"/>.
</t>

<t>
   Upon receipt of the contact header, both nodes perform the
   validation and negotiation procedures defined in
   <xref target="sec:negotiation"/>
</t>

<t>
   After receiving the contact header from the other node, either node
   MAY also refuse the connection by sending a SHUTDOWN message.  If
   connection setup is refused, a reason MUST be included in the
   SHUTDOWN message. 
</t>

<section title="Contact Header" anchor="sec:contact_header">

Once a TCP connection is established, both parties exchange a contact

<section title="Validation and Parameter Negotiation" anchor="sec:negotiation">

<t>
Upon reception of the contact header, each node follows the following
procedures to ensure the validity of the TCPCL connection and to
negotiate values for the connection parameters.
</t>

<t>
If the magic string is not present or is not valid, the connection
MUST be terminated.  The intent of the magic string is to provide
some protection against an inadvertent TCP connection by a different
protocol than the one described in this document.  To prevent a flood
of repeated connections from a misconfigured application, a node MAY
elect to hold an invalid connection open and idle for some time before
closing it.
</t>

<t>
If a node receives a contact header containing a version that is
greater than the current version of the protocol that the node
implements, then the node SHOULD interpret all fields and messages as
it would normally.  If a node receives a contact header with a version
that is lower than the version of the protocol that the node
implements, the node may either terminate the connection due to the
version mismatch or may adapt its operation to conform to the older
version of the protocol.  This decision is an implementation matter.
</t>

<t>
A node calculates the parameters for a TCPCL connection by negotiating
the values from its own preferences (conveyed by the contact header it
sent) with the preferences of the peer node (expressed in the contact
header that it received).  This negotiation MUST proceed in the
following manner:

<list style="symbols">
   
   <t>The parameter for requesting acknowledgment of bundle segments is set to true
      iff the corresponding flag is set in both contact headers.

   <t>The parameter for enabling reactive fragmentation is set to true iff
      the corresponding flag is set in both contact headers.

   <t>The bundle refusal capability is set to true if the corresponding flag is
     set in both contact headers and if segment acknowledgment has been

           title="Format of DATA_SEGMENT Messages">
   <preamble>
      Each bundle is transmitted in one or more data segments. The
      format of a DATA_SEGMENT message follows:
   </preamble>
<artwork>
                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</artwork>
</figure>

<t>
   The type portion of the message header contains the value 0x1.
</t>
   
<t>
   The flags portion of the message header byte contains two optional
   values in the two low-order bits, denoted 'S' and 'E' above. The
   'S' bit MUST be set to one if it precedes the transmission of the
   first segment of a new bundle.  The 'E' bit MUST be set to one when
   transmitting the last segment of a bundle.
</t>
<t>
   Following the message header, the length field is an SDNV
   containing the number of bytes of bundle data that are transmitted
   in this segment. Following this length is the actual data contents.
</t>
<t>
   Determining the size of the segment is an implementation matter.
   In particular, a node may, based on local policy or configuration,
   only ever transmit bundle data in a single segment, in which case
   both the 'S' and 'E' bits MUST be set to one.
</t>
<t>
   In the Bundle Protocol specification <xref target="RFC5050" />, a single bundle comprises a
   primary bundle block, a payload block, and zero or more additional
   bundle blocks.  The relationship between the protocol blocks and
   the convergence-layer segments is an implementation-specific
   decision.  In particular, a segment MAY contain more than one
   protocol block; alternatively, a single protocol block (such as the
   payload) MAY be split into multiple segments.
</t>
<t>
   However, a single segment MUST NOT contain data of more than a
   single bundle.
</t>
<t>
   Once a transmission of a bundle has commenced, the node MUST only
   send segments containing sequential portions of that bundle until
   it sends a segment with the 'E' bit set.
</t>
</section> <!-- Bundle Data -->

<section title="Bundle Acknowledgments (ACK_SEGMENT)" anchor="sec:acks">

<t>
   Although the TCP transport provides reliable transfer of data
   between transport peers, the typical BSD sockets interface provides
   no means to inform a sending application of when the receiving
   application has processed some amount of transmitted data.  Thus,
   after transmitting some data, a Bundle Protocol agent needs an
   additional mechanism to determine whether the receiving agent has
   successfully received the segment.
</t>

<t>
   To this end, the TCPCL protocol offers an optional feature whereby
   a receiving node transmits acknowledgments of reception of data
   segments.  This feature is enabled if, and only if, during the
   exchange of contact headers, both parties set the flag to indicate
   that segment acknowledgments are enabled (see <xref
   target="sec:contact_header"/>).  If so, then the receiver MUST
   transmit a bundle acknowledgment message when it successfully
   receives each data segment.
</t>

<figure anchor="fig:ack_message"
        title="Format of ACK_SEGMENT Messages">
   <preamble>
      The format of a bundle acknowledgment is as follows:
   </preamble>
<artwork>
                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</artwork>
</figure>

<t>
   To transmit an acknowledgment, a node first transmits a message header with
   the ACK_SEGMENT type code and all flags set to zero, then transmits an SDNV
   containing the cumulative length in bytes of the received segment(s) of the
   current bundle. The length MUST fall on a segment boundary. That is, only
   full segments can be acknowledged.
</t>
<t>
   For example, suppose the sending node transmits four segments of
   bundle data with lengths 100, 200, 500, and 1000,
   respectively. After receiving the first segment, the node sends an
   acknowledgment of length 100.  After the second segment is
   received, the node sends an acknowledgment of length 300. The third
   and fourth acknowledgments are of length 800 and 1800, respectively.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Bundle Refusal (REFUSE_BUNDLE)" anchor="sec:refusal">

<t>
   As bundles may be large, the TCPCL supports an optional mechanisms
   by which a receiving node may indicate to the sender that it does
   not want to receive the corresponding bundle.
</t>
<t>
   To do so, upon receiving a DATA_SEGMENT message, the node MAY
   transmit a REFUSE_BUNDLE message.  As data segments and
   acknowledgments may cross on the wire, the bundle that is being refused is
   implicitly identified by the sequence in which acknowledgements and refusals
   are received.
</t>

<figure anchor="fig:refuse_bundle"
  title="Format of REFUSE_BUNDLE Messages">
  <preamble>The format of the REFUSE_BUNDLE message is as follows:</preamble>

  for some values.  Other values may be registered with IANA, as defined in
  <xref target="iana"/>.</t>

</texttable>

<t>
   The receiver MUST, for each bundle preceding the one to be refused, have
   either acknowledged all DATA_SEGMENTs or refused the bundle. This allows the
   sender to identify the bundles accepted and refused by means of a simple FIFO
   list of segments and acknowledgments.
</t>
<t>
   The bundle refusal MAY be sent before the entire data segment is
   received.  If a sender receives a REFUSE_BUNDLE message, the sender
   MUST complete the transmission of any partially sent DATA_SEGMENT
   message (so that the receiver stays in sync).  The sender MUST NOT
   commence transmission of any further segments of the rejected
   bundle subsequently.  Note, however, that this requirement does not
   ensure that a node will not receive another DATA_SEGMENT for the
   same bundle after transmitting a REFUSE_BUNDLE message since
   messages may cross on the wire; if this happens, subsequent
   segments of the bundle SHOULD also be refused with a REFUSE_BUNDLE
   message.
</t>
<t>
   Note: If a bundle transmission is aborted in this way, the receiver
   may not receive a segment with the 'E' flag set to '1' for the
   aborted bundle.  The beginning of the next bundle is identified by
   the 'S' bit set to '1', indicating the start of a new bundle.

  <t>LENGTH messages MUST NOT be sent unless the corresponding flag bit is set

    at the sender's discretion. LENGTH messages MUST NOT be sent unless the next
    DATA_SEGMENT message has the 'S' bit set to "1" (i.e., just before the start of
    a new bundle).</t>

  <t>A receiver MAY send a BUNDLE_REFUSE message as soon as it receives a LENGTH
    message without waiting for the next DATA_SEGMENT message. 
The sender MUST be prepared for this and MUST associate the refusal

<section title="KEEPALIVE Feature (KEEPALIVE)" anchor="sec:keepalive">
<t>
   The protocol includes a provision for transmission of KEEPALIVE
   messages over the TCP connection to help determine if the
   connection has been disrupted.
</t>

<t>
   As described in <xref target="sec:contact_header"/>, one of the
   parameters in the contact header is the keepalive_interval.  Both
   sides populate this field with their requested intervals (in
   seconds) between KEEPALIVE messages.
</t>

<t>
   The format of a KEEPALIVE message is a one-byte message type code
   of KEEPALIVE (as described in <xref target="types:codes"/>) with no
   additional data. Both sides SHOULD send a KEEPALIVE message
   whenever the negotiated interval has elapsed with no transmission
   of any message (KEEPALIVE or other).
</t>

<t>
   If no message (KEEPALIVE or other) has been received for at least
   twice the keepalive_interval, then either party MAY terminate the
   session by transmitting a one-byte SHUTDOWN message
   (as described in <xref target="types:codes"/>) and by closing the TCP
   connection.
</t>

<t>
   Note: The keepalive_interval should not be chosen too short as TCP
   retransmissions may occur in case of packet loss.  Those will have
   to be triggered by a timeout (TCP retransmission timeout (RTO)), which is dependent on the
   measured RTT for the TCP connection so that KEEPALIVE messages may
   experience noticeable latency.

   To cleanly shut down a connection, a SHUTDOWN message MUST be

   It is possible for a node to convey additional information
   regarding the reason for connection termination.  To do so, the
   node MUST set the 'R' bit in the message header flags and transmit
   a one-byte reason code immediately following the message
   header. The specified values of the reason code are:

</texttable>


<t>
   It is also possible to convey a requested reconnection delay to
   indicate how long the other node must wait before attempting
   connection re-establishment. To do so, the node sets the 'D' bit in
   the message header flags and then transmits an SDNV specifying the
   requested delay, in seconds, following the message header (and
   optionally, the SHUTDOWN reason code).  The value 0 SHALL be
   interpreted as an infinite delay, i.e., that the connecting node
   MUST NOT re-establish the connection.  In contrast, if the node
   does not wish to request a delay, it SHOULD omit the reconnection delay field
   (and set the 'D' bit to zero). 
Note that in the figure above, the reconnection delay SDNV is represented as a
two-byte field for convenience.
</t>

<t>
   A connection shutdown MAY occur immediately after TCP connection
   establishment or reception of a contact header (and prior to any
   further data exchange).  This may, for example, be used to notify
   that the node is currently not able or willing
   to communicate.  However, a node MUST always send the contact
   header to its peer before sending a SHUTDOWN message.
</t>

<t>
   If either node terminates a connection prematurely in this manner,
   it SHOULD send a SHUTDOWN message and MUST indicate a reason code
   unless the incoming connection did not include the magic string.
   If a node does not want its peer to reopen the connection
   immediately, it SHOULD set the 'D' bit in the flags and include a
   reconnection delay to indicate when the peer is allowed to attempt
   another connection setup.
</t>

<t>
   If a connection is to be terminated before another protocol message
   has completed, then the node MUST NOT transmit the SHUTDOWN message
   but still SHOULD close the TCP connection.  In particular, if the
   connection is to be closed (for whatever reason) while a node is in
   the process of transmitting a bundle data segment, the receiving node
   is still expecting segment data and might erroneously interpret the
   SHUTDOWN message to be part of the data segment.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Idle Connection Shutdown" anchor="sec:idle">
<t>
   The protocol includes a provision for clean shutdown of idle TCP
   connections. Determining the length of time to wait before closing
   idle connections, if they are to be closed at all, is an
   implementation and configuration matter.
</t>

<t>
   If there is a configured time to close idle links and if no
   bundle data (other than KEEPALIVE messages) has been received for
   at least that amount of time, then either node MAY terminate the
   connection by transmitting a SHUTDOWN message indicating the reason
   code of 'Idle timeout' (as described in <xref target="shutdown:reason"/>).  After receiving a
   SHUTDOWN message in response, both sides may close the TCP
   connection.
</t>

</section> <!-- Idle shutdown -->

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
   One security consideration for this protocol relates to the fact
   that nodes present their endpoint identifier as part of the
   connection header exchange. It would be possible for a node to
   fake this value and present the identity of a singleton endpoint
   in which the node is not a member, essentially masquerading as
   another DTN node. If this identifier is used without further
   verification as a means to determine which bundles are transmitted
   over the connection, then the node that has falsified its identity
   may be able to obtain bundles that it should not have. Therefore, a node
   SHALL NOT use the endpoint identifier conveyed in the TCPCL connection
   message to derive a peer node's identity unless it can ascertain it via other
   means.
</t>



<t>
   These concerns may be mitigated through the use of
   the <xref target="RFC6257">Bundle Security
   Protocol</xref>. In particular, the Bundle Authentication Block
   defines mechanism for secure exchange of bundles between DTN nodes.
   Thus, an implementation could delay trusting the presented endpoint
   identifier until the node can securely validate that its peer is in
   fact the only member of the given singleton endpoint.
</t>

<t>In general, TCPCL does not provide any security services. The mechanisms
  defined in <xref target="RFC6257"/> are to be used instead.</t>

<t>Nothing in TCPCL prevents the use of the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
  protocol <xref target="RFC5246"/> to secure a connection.</t>
   
<t>
   Another consideration for this protocol relates to denial-of-service
   attacks. A node may send a large amount of data over a TCP
   connection, requiring the receiving node to handle the data,
   attempt to stop the flood of data by sending a REFUSE_BUNDLE
   message, or forcibly terminate the connection. This burden could
   cause denial of service on other, well-behaving connections. There
   is also nothing to prevent a malicious node from continually
   establishing connections and repeatedly trying to send copious
   amounts of bundle data. A listening node MAY take countermeasures such as
   ignoring TCP SYN messages, closing TCP connections as soon as they are
   established, waiting before sending the contact header, sending a SHUTDOWN
   message quickly or with a delay, etc.
