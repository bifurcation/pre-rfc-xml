      <t>
	This document describes a protocol for supporting Mobile
	Networks between a Mobile Router and a Home Agent by extending
	the Mobile IPv4 protocol.  A Mobile Router is responsible for
	the mobility of one or more network segments or subnets moving
	together.  The Mobile Router hides its mobility from the nodes
	on the Mobile Network.  The nodes on the Mobile Network may be
	fixed in relationship to the Mobile Router and may not have
	any mobility function.
     </t>
      <t>
	Extensions to Mobile IPv4 are introduced to support Mobile
	Networks.

    </abstract>

    <section anchor='intro' title='Introduction'>
      <t>
	This document describes network mobility extensions to the
	Mobile IPv4 protocol.  The goal of introducing these
	extensions is to accommodate mobility scenarios where groups of
	hosts and routers move homogeneously (as a whole).  It is
	required that all hosts and routers in a Mobile Network be
	able to run applications connecting to the Internet, and be
	reachable from the Internet.
      </t>

      <t>
	For details regarding terminology related to network mobility
	(NEMO), a quick read of <xref
	target='RFC4885'>RFC&nbsp;4885</xref> is suggested.
      </t>

      <section anchor='examplemobnet' title='Examples of Mobile Networks'>
      <t>
	A Mobile Network links together a set of hosts and routers.
	Connecting this Mobile Network to the Internet is ensured at
	two levels: first, a Mobile Router is connected on one side to
	the Mobile Network and on another side to a wireless access
	system; second, a Home Agent placed on the home link manages
	traffic between the Correspondent Node and a Local Fixed Node
	(LFN, a node in the Mobile Network) by means of encapsulating
	traffic.
      </t>

      <t>
	A scenario of applicability for this Mobile Network is
	described next.  A Mobile Network is formed by a
	wireless-enabled Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) and a
	portable photographic camera, linked together by Bluetooth
	wireless link-layer technology.  This is sometimes referred to
	as a Personal Area Network (PAN).  In the illustration below,
	one can notice the PDA playing the role of a Mobile Router and
	the camera the role of Local Fixed Node.

      <t>
	The camera (Local Fixed Node) uploads photographic content to
	a Correspondent Node (CN) server.  When the Mobile Network
	moves away, the Mobile Router serving the Mobile Network
	changes its point of attachment from one cellular access
	(Access Router) to another, obtaining a new Care-of Address.
	The Home Agent (HA) encapsulates application traffic for the CN
	and LFN.
      </t>

      <t>
	Whereas the illustration above is a very simple instantiation
	of the applicability of Mobile IP-based Mobile Networks, more
	complex Mobile Networks are easily accommodated by the Mobile
	IPv4 extensions presented in this document (NEMOv4).  For
	example, laptop computers used by passengers in a bus, train,
	ship, or plane should all be considered as forming Mobile
	Networks, as long as they move together (homogeneously).

      <section anchor='overviewproto' title='Overview of Protocol'>
      <t>
	As introduced previously, this document presents extensions to
	the Mobile IPv4 protocol.  The entities sending and receiving
	these extensions are the Mobile Router and the Home Agent.
	The Local Fixed Node is relieved from running Mobile IP
	software and, although it moves (together with the Mobile
	Network), its IP stack is not seeing any change in addressing.
      </t>
      <t>
	Mobility for the entire Mobile Network is supported by the
	Mobile Router registering its current point of attachment
	(Care-of Address) to its Home Agent: the Mobile Router sends an
	extended Registration Request to the Home Agent, which returns an
	extended Registration Reply.  This signaling sets up the
	tunnel between the two entities, as illustrated in the
	following figure:

	The prefix(es) used within a Mobile Network (either implicitly
	configured on the Home Agent or explicitly identified by the
	Mobile Router in the Registration Request) is/are advertised
	by the Home Agent for route propagation in the home network.
	Traffic to and from nodes in the Mobile Network are tunneled
	by the Home Agent to the Mobile Router, and vice versa.
	Though packets from a Local Fixed Node placed in the Mobile
	Network can be forwarded by the Mobile Router directly without
	tunneling (if reverse tunneling were not used), these packets
	will be dropped if ingress filtering is turned on at the
	Access Router.
      </t>
      
      <t>
	Extensively relating to Mobile IPv4 <xref
	target='RFC3344'/>, this specification
	addresses mainly the co-located Care-of Address mode.  Foreign
	Agent Care-of Address mode (with 'legacy' Foreign Agents
	<xref target='RFC3344' />) is supported but
	without optimization, and with double encapsulation being used.  For an
	optimization of this mode, the gentle reader is directed to
	<xref target='NEMOv4-FA'>an extension
	document</xref>.
      </t>

      <t>
	Compared to Mobile IPv4, this document specifies an additional
	tunnel between a Mobile Router's Home Address and the Home
	Agent.  This tunnel is encapsulated within the normal tunnel
	between the Care-of Address (CoA) and Home Agent.  In Foreign
	Agent CoA mode, the tunnel between the Mobile Router and Home
	Agent is needed to allow the Foreign Agent to direct the
	decapsulated packet to the proper visiting Mobile Router.
	However, in co-located CoA mode, the additional tunnel is not
	essential and could be eliminated because the Mobile Router is
	the recipient of the encapsulated packets for the Mobile
	Network; a proposal for this feature is in <xref
	target='NEMOv4-FA'>the extending
	document mentioned above</xref>.
      </t>
      <t>
	All traffic between the nodes in the Mobile Network and
	the Correspondent Nodes passes through the Home Agent.  This
	document does not touch on aspects related to route
	optimization of this traffic.

      <t>
	A similar protocol has been documented in <xref

	Agent using static configuration or running a routing protocol
	(see Section 4.5 of <xref
	target='RFC3344'>RFC&nbsp;3344</xref>), there is no solution
	for explicit registration of the Mobile Networks served by the
	Mobile Router.  A solution needs to provide the Home Agent a

	    The Local Fixed Nodes on a Mobile Network should be able

      <t>      
	A Mobile Router's operation is generally derived from the
	behavior of a Mobile Node, as set in <xref
	target='RFC3344'>RFC&nbsp;3344</xref>.  In addition to
	maintaining mobility bindings for its Home Address, the Mobile
	Router, together with the Home Agent, maintains forwarding
	information for the Mobile Network Prefix(es) assigned to the
	Mobile Router.
      </t>

      <t>
	A Mobile Router SHOULD set the 'T' bit to 1 in all
	Registration Request messages it sends to indicate the need
	for reverse tunnels for all traffic.  Without reverse tunnels,
	all the traffic from the Mobile Network will be subject to
	ingress filtering in the visited networks.  Upon reception of
	a successful Registration Reply, the Mobile Router processes
	the registration in accordance to <xref target='RFC3344'>RFC
	3344</xref>.  In addition, the following steps are taken:
      </t>

      <t>
	<list style='symbols'>
	  <t>
	    Check for Mobile Network Acknowledgement extension(s) in
	    Registration Reply.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Create tunnel to the Home Agent if the Mobile Router is registered in reverse
	    tunneling mode.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Set up default route via this tunnel or egress interface
	    when the Mobile Router is registered with or without reverse tunneling,
	    respectively.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>

      <t>
	In accordance with this specification, a Mobile Router may
	operate in one of the following two modes: explicit and
	implicit.  In explicit mode, the Mobile Router includes Mobile
	Network Prefix information in all Registration Requests (as
	Mobile Network Request extensions), while in implicit mode it
	does not include this information in any Registration Request.
	In the latter case, the Home Agent obtains the Mobile Network
	Prefixes by other means than Mobile IP.  One example of
	obtaining the Mobile Network Prefix is through static
	configuration on the Home Agent.
      </t>

      <t>
	A Mobile Router can obtain a co-located or Foreign Agent
	Care-of Address while operating in explicit or implicit modes.
      </t>

      <t>
	For deregistration, the Mobile Router sends a registration
	request with lifetime set to zero without any Mobile Network
	Request extensions.
      </t>

      <section anchor='errprocessing' title='Error Processing'>
	<t>
	  In a Mobile IP Registration Reply message, there may be two
	  Code fields: one proper to the Registration Reply header
	  (the 'proper' Code) and one within the Mobile Network
	  Acknowledgement Extension (simply the 'Code').

          A Mobile Router interprets the values of the Code field in
          the Mobile Network Acknowledgement Extension of the
          Registration Reply in order to identify any error related to
          managing the Mobile Network Prefixes by the Home Agent.  It
          also interprets the values of the Code field in the
          Registration Reply header (the proper Code).
	</t>

	<t>
	  If the value of the Code field in the Registration Reply
	  (the proper) is set to HA_MOBNET_DISALLOWED, then the Mobile
	  Router MUST stop sending Registration Requests with any
	  Mobile Network Prefix extensions to that Home Agent.
	</t>

	<t>
	  If the value of the Code field in the Registration Reply
	  (the proper) is set to HA_MOBNET_ERROR, then the Mobile
	  Router MUST stop sending Registration Requests that contain
	  any of the Mobile Network Prefixes that are defined by the
	  values of the fields Prefix and Prefix Length in the Mobile
	  Network Acknowledgement extension.  Note that the
	  registration is denied in this case, and no forwarding for
	  any Mobile Network Prefixes would be set up by the Home
	  Agent for the Mobile Router.
	</t>

	<t>
	  It is possible that the Mobile Router receives a
	  Registration Reply with no Mobile Network extensions if the
	  registration was processed by a Mobile IPv4 Home Agent that
	  does not support this specification at all.  In that case,
	  the absence of Mobile Network extensions must be interpreted
	  by the Mobile Router as the case where the Home Agent does
	  not support Mobile Networks.

	Nested Network Mobility is a scenario where a Mobile Router

	There could be arbitrary levels of nested mobility.  The
	operation of each Mobile Router remains the same whether the
	Mobile Router attaches to another Mobile Router or to a fixed
	Access Router on the Internet.  The solution described here
	does not place any restriction on the number of levels for
	nested mobility.  Two issues should be noted though.  First,
	whenever physical loops occur in a nested aggregation of
	Mobile Networks, this protocol neither detects nor solves
	them -- datagram forwarding may be blocked.  Second, Mobile
	Routers in a deep nested aggregation of Mobile Networks might
	introduce significant overhead on the data packets as each
	level of nesting introduces another tunnel header
	encapsulation.  Applications that do not support MTU discovery
	are adversely affected by the additional header
	encapsulations because the usable MTU is reduced with each
	level of nesting.

    <section anchor='routingprotocol'

		    between Mobile Router and Home Agent'>
      <t>
	There are several benefits of running a dynamic routing
	protocol between the Mobile Router and the Home Agent.  If the
	Mobile Network is relatively large, including several wireless
	subnets, then the topology changes within the moving network
	can be exposed from the Mobile Router to the Home Agent by
	using a dynamic routing protocol.  The purpose of the NEMOv4
	protocol extensions to Mobile IPv4, as defined in previous
	sections, is not to inform the Home Agent about these topology
	changes, but to manage the mobility of the Mobile Router.
      </t>

      <t>
	Similarly, topology changes in the home network can be exposed
	to the Mobile Router by using a dynamic routing protocol.
	This may be necessary when new fixed networks are added in the
	home network.  Here too, the purpose of NEMOv4 extensions is
	not to inform the Mobile Router about topology changes at
	home.
      </t>

      <t>
	Examples of dynamic routing protocols include, but are not
	limited to, OSPF Version 2 <xref target='RFC2328' />,
	BGP <xref target='RFC4271' />,
	and RIP <xref target='RFC2453' />.
      </t>

      <t>
	The recommendations are related to how the routing protocol
	and the Mobile IPv4 implementation work in tandem on the
	Mobile Router and on the Home Agent (1) without creating
	incoherent states in the forwarding information bases at home
	and on the Mobile Router, (2) without introducing
	topologically incorrect addressing information in the visited
	domain, and (3) without duplicating sent data or
	over-provisioning security.
      </t>

      <t>
	The information exchanged between the Mobile Router and the
	Home Agent is sent over the bi-directional tunnel established
	by the Mobile IPv4 exchange Registration Request -
	Registration Reply (see <xref target='establishment-bidir'
	/>).  If a network address and prefix of a subnet in the
	moving network is sent by the Mobile Router within a routing
	protocol message, then they SHOULD NOT be sent in the Mobile
	IPv4 Registration Request too.  This avoids incoherencies
	in the forwarding information bases.  The Mobile Router SHOULD
	use NEMOv4 implicit mode in this case (see <xref target='reqs'
	/>).
      </t>

      <t>
	The Mobile Router SHOULD NOT send routing protocol information
	updates in the foreign network.  The subnet addresses and
	prefixes valid in the moving network are topologically
	incorrect in the visited network.
      </t>

      <t>
	If the Mobile Router and the Home Agent use a dynamic routing
	protocol over the tunnel interface, and if that protocol
	offers security mechanisms to protect that protocol's
	messages, then the security recommendations in <xref
	target='secrtprotocol' /> apply.

    <section anchor='seccons' title='Security Considerations'>
      <t>
	The Mobile Network extension is protected by the same rules as
	for Mobile IP extensions in registration messages.  See the
	Security Considerations section in <xref target='RFC3344'>RFC
	3344</xref>.
      </t>

      <t>
	The Home Agent MUST be able to verify that the Mobile Router
	is authorized to provide mobility service for the Mobile
	Networks in the Registration Request, before anchoring these
	Mobile Network Prefixes on behalf of the Mobile Router.
	Forwarding for prefixes MUST NOT be set up without successful
	authorization of the Mobile Router for those prefixes.  The Mobile Router
	MUST be notified when there is a registration failure because
	it cannot be successfully authorized for prefixes it requested.
      </t>

      <t>
	All Registration Requests and replies MUST be authenticated by
	the MN-HA Authentication Extension as specified in <xref
	target='RFC3344'>RFC&nbsp;3344</xref>.  When the registration
	request is sent in explicit mode, i.e., with one or more
	Mobile Network Prefix extensions, all the Mobile Network
	Prefix extensions MUST be included before the MN-HA
	Authentication extension.  Also, these extensions MUST be
	included in the calculation of the MN-HA authenticator value.
      </t>

      <t>
	The Mobile Router should perform ingress filtering on all the
	packets received on the Mobile Network prior to reverse
	tunneling them to the Home Agent.  The Mobile Router MUST drop
	any packets that do not have a source address belonging to the
	Mobile Network.
      </t>

      <t>
	The Mobile Router MUST also ensure that the source address of
	packets arriving on the Mobile Network is not the same as the
	Mobile Router's IP address on any interface.  These checks
	will protect against nodes attempting to launch IP spoofing
	attacks through the bi-directional tunnel.
      </t>

      <t>
	The Home Agent, upon receiving packets through the
	bi-directional tunnel, MUST verify that the source addresses
	of the outer IP header of the packets are set to the Mobile
	Router's Care-of Address.  Also, it MUST ensure that the
	source address of the inner IP header is a topologically
	correct address on the Mobile Network.  This will prevent
	nodes from using the Home Agent to launch attacks inside the
	protected network.
      </t>

      <section anchor='secrtprotocol'
	       title='Security when Dynamic Routing Protocol Is Used'>
	<t>
	  If a dynamic routing protocol is used between the Mobile
	  Router and the Home Agent to propagate the Mobile Network
	  information into the home network, the routing updates
	  SHOULD be protected with IPsec ESP confidentiality between
	  the Mobile Router and Home Agent, to prevent information
	  about home network topology from being visible to
	  eavesdroppers.
	</t>

    <section anchor='IANA'
	     title='IANA Considerations'>
      <t>
	IANA has assigned rules for the existing registry "Mobile IPv4
	numbers - per RFC&nbsp;3344".  The numbering space for
	Extensions that may appear in Mobile IP control messages
	(those sent to and from UDP port number 434) should be
	modified.
      </t>
