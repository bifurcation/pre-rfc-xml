                <t> RFC 5965 defines an extensible, machine-readable
                    format intended for mail operators to report
                    feedback about received email to other parties.
                    This applicability statement describes common
                    methods for utilizing this format for reporting
                    both abuse and authentication failure events.
                    Mailbox Providers of any size, mail-sending
                    entities, and end users can use these methods as
                    a basis to create procedures that best suit
                    them.  Some related optional mechanisms are
                    also discussed. </t>

        <section title="Introduction">
                <t> The Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) was initially
                    developed for two very specific use cases.
                    Initially, it was intended to be used for
                    reporting feedback between large email operators,
                    or from large email operators to end user network
                    access operators, any of whom could be presumed to
                    have automated abuse-handling systems.
                    Secondarily, it is used by those same large mail
                    operators to send those same reports to other
                    entities, including those involved in sending bulk
                    email for commercial purposes.  In either case,
                    the reports would be triggered by direct end user 
                    action such as clicking on a "report spam" button
                    in their email client. </t>
                        
                <t> Though other uses for ARF as defined in
                    <xref target="RFC5965"/> have been discussed (and
                    may be documented similarly in the future), abuse
                    reporting remains the primary application, with a small
                    amount of adoption of extensions that enable
                    authentication failure reporting. </t>

                <t> This applicability statement provides direction
                    for using ARF in
                    both contexts.  It also includes some statements
                    about the use of ARF in conjunction with other email
                    technologies. </t>
                        
                <t> The purpose for reporting abusive messages is to
                    stop recurrences.  The methods described in this
                    document focus on automating abuse reporting as
                    much as practical, so as to minimize the work of
                    a site's abuse team.  There are further reasons why
                    abuse feedback generation is worthwhile, such as 
                    instruction of mail filters or reputation trackers,
                    or initiation of investigations of particularly
                    egregious abuses.  These other applications are
                    not discussed in this memo. </t>

                <t> Further introduction to this topic may be found
                    in <xref target="RFC6449"/>, which has more information
                    about the general topic of abuse reporting.  Many
                    of the specific ARF guidelines in this document were
                    taken from the principles presented in <xref target="RFC6449"/>.

 </t>

                <t> At the time of publication of this document, five
                    feedback types are registered.  This document only
                    discusses two of them ("abuse" <xref target="RFC5965"/>
                    and "auth-failure" <xref target="RFC6591"/>), as
                    they are seeing sufficient use in practice that
                    applicability statements can be made about them.
                    The others, i.e., "fraud" <xref target="RFC5965"/>,
                    "other" <xref target="RFC5965"/>, and
                    "not-spam" <xref target="RFC6430"/>, are either too new
                    or too seldom used to be included here.

                    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",

                    to be interpreted as described in
                    <xref target="RFC2119"/> and are intended
                    to replace the Requirement Levels
                    described in Section 3.3 of
                    <xref target="RFC2026"/>. </t>
                
                <t> Some of the terminology used in this

                <t> "Mailbox Provider" refers to an
                    organization that accepts, stores, and
                    offers access to <xref target="RFC5322"/>
                    messages ("email messages") for end users.
                    Such an organization has typically
                    implemented SMTP <xref target="RFC5321"/>
                    and might provide access to messages through 
                    IMAP
                    <xref target="RFC3501"/>, the
                    Post Office Protocol (POP) <xref target="RFC1939"/>,
                    a proprietary interface designed for HTTP
                    <xref target="RFC2616"/>, or a
                    proprietary protocol. </t>
        </section>
                
        <section title="Solicited and Unsolicited Reports">
           <t>The original, and still by far the most common,
              application of <xref target="RFC5965"/> is when two mail
              systems make a private agreement to exchange abuse
              reports -- usually reports due to recipients manually
              reporting messages as spam.  We refer to these as
              solicited reports.</t>

           <t>Other uses for ARF involve such reports sent between parties
              that don't know each other.  These unsolicited reports
              are sent without prior arrangement between the parties
              as to the context and meaning of the reports. Therefore,
              the constraints on how these unsolicited reports need to
              be structured such that they are likely to be useful to
              the recipient -- e.g., to what address(es) they can
              usefully be sent, what issues they can be used to report,
              and how they can be handled by the receiver of the report --
              are very different.</t>

           <t>The two cases are covered separately in the sections that
follow. </t>

                            discussed in Section 4.4 of <xref target="RFC6449"/>. </t>

                            in <xref target="RFC5965"/>, which created an IANA
                            registry for valid values to allow for extensions.
                            However, to allow for handling of new types that
                            are not yet supported, an automated report
                            processing system MUST NOT reject (in the SMTP
                            sense) a report based solely on an unknown
                            Feedback-Type.
                            The automated system can simply set reports of
                            unknown types aside for manual handling.  However,

                            analysis to separate different types of abuse
                            reports after receipt if they do not have prior

                        <t> It is essential for report recipients to be capable
                            of throttling reports being sent to avoid damage
                            to their own installations.  Therefore, Feedback
                            Providers MUST provide a way for report
                            recipients to request that no further reports be
                            sent.  Unfortunately, no standardized mechanism
                            for such requests exists to date, and all
                            existing mechanisms for meeting this requirement
                            are out-of-band. </t>

                        <t> Message authentication is generally a good
                            idea, but it is especially important to
                            encourage credibility of, and thus response
                            to, unsolicited reports.  Therefore, as
                            with any other message, Feedback Providers
                            sending unsolicited reports SHOULD send
                            reports that they expect will pass the Sender
                            Policy Framework (SPF) <xref target="RFC4408"/>

                        <t> Handling of unsolicited reports has a
                            significant cost to the report receiver.  Senders
                            of unsolicited reports, especially those
                            sending large volumes of them
                            automatically, SHOULD NOT send reports that cannot
                            be used as a basis for action by the recipient,
                            whether this is due to the report being sent about
                            an incident that is not abuse-related, the
                            report being sent to an email address that
                            won't result in action, or the content or
                            format of the report being hard for the
                            recipient to read or use. </t>

                        <t> Feedback Providers SHOULD NOT report all mail sent
                            from a particular sender merely because
                            some of it is determined to be abusive. </t>

                        <t> Mechanical reports of mail that "looks
                            like" spam, based solely on the results
                            of inline content analysis tools, SHOULD
                            NOT be sent since, because of their
                            subjective nature, they are unlikely to
                            provide a basis for the recipient to take
                            action.  Complaints generated by end users about
                            mail that is determined by them to be abusive,
                            or mail delivered to "spam trap" or "honeypot"
                            addresses, are far more likely to be accurate and
                            MAY be sent. </t>

                        <t> If a Feedback Provider applies SPF
                            <xref target="RFC4408"/> to
                            arriving messages, a report SHOULD NOT be
                            generated to the RFC5321.MailFrom domain
                            if the SPF evaluation produced a "Fail",
                            "SoftFail", "TempError", or "PermError"
                            report, as no reliable assertion or assumption
                            can be made that use of the domain was
                            authorized.  A valid exception would be specific
                            knowledge that the SPF result is not
                            definitive for that domain under those
                            circumstances (for example, a message that
                            is also signed using DKIM <xref target="RFC6376"/>
                            by the same domain, and that signature
                            validates). </t>

                        <t> Rather than generating feedback reports themselves,
                            MUAs SHOULD create abuse reports and send these
                            reports back to their
                            Mailbox Providers so that they can generate and
                            send ARF messages on behalf of end users (see
                            Section&nbsp;3.2 of <xref target="RFC6449"/>).
                            This
                            allows centralized processing and tracking of
                            reports, and provides training input to filtering
                            systems.  There is, however, no standard mechanism
                            for this signaling between MUAs and Mailbox
                            Providers to trigger abuse reports. </t>

                        <t> Feedback Providers SHOULD NOT send reports to
                            recipients that are uninvolved or only
                            peripherally involved.  For example, they
                            SHOULD NOT send reports to the operator
                            of every Autonomous System in the path
                            between the apparent originating system
                            and the operator generating the
                            report.  Instead, they need to send reports to
                            recipients that are both responsible for
                            the messages and able to do something
                            about them.  </t>

                        <t> Deciding where to send an unsolicited
                            report will typically rely on heuristics.
                            Abuse addresses in WHOIS <xref target="RFC3912"/>
                            records of the IP address relaying the subject
                            message and/or of the domain name found in the
                            results of a PTR ("reverse lookup") query
                            on that address are likely reasonable
                            candidates, as is the abuse@domain role
                            address (see <xref target="RFC2142"/>) of
                            related domains.  Unsolicited reports
                            SHOULD NOT be sent to email addresses that
                            are not clearly intended to handle abuse reports.
                            Legitimate candidates include those found in
                            WHOIS records or on a web site that either
                            are explicitly described as an abuse contact or
                            are of the form "abuse@domain". </t>

                        <t> Where an abusive message is authenticated using a
                            domain-level authentication technology
                            such as DKIM <xref target="RFC6376"/>
                            or SPF <xref target="RFC4408"/>, the
                            domain that has been verified by the
                            authentication mechanism is often a
                            reasonable candidate for receiving
                            feedback about the message.  For DKIM,
                            though, while the authenticated domain
                            has some responsibility for the mail sent,
                            it can be a poor contact point for abuse
                            issues (for example, it could represent
                            the message's author but not its sender,
                            it could identify the bad actor
                            responsible for the message, or it could
                            refer to a domain that cannot receive mail
                            at all). </t>

                        <t> Often, unsolicited reports will have no meaning
                            if sent to abuse reporting addresses belonging to
                            the abusive parties themselves.  In fact, it is
                            possible that such reports might reveal information
                            about complainants.  Reports SHOULD NOT be
                            sent to such addresses if they can be identified
                            beforehand, except where the abusive party
                            is known to be responsive to such reports. </t>

                        <t> Reports SHOULD use "Feedback-Type: abuse"
                            but can use other types as appropriate.
                            However, the Mailbox Provider generating
                            the reports cannot assume that the
                            operator receiving the reports will treat
                            different Feedback-Types differently. </t>

                        <t> Reports SHOULD include the following
                            optional fields whenever their corresponding
                            values are available and applicable to the report:
                            Original-Mail-From, Arrival-Date,
                            Source-IP, and Original-Rcpt-To.  Other
                            optional fields can be included as deemed
                            appropriate by the implementer. </t>
                                
                        <t> Experience suggests that the use of ARF is
                            advisable in most contexts.  Automated
                            recipient systems can handle abuse reports
                            sent in ARF at least as well as any
                            other format such as plain text, with or
                            without a copy of the message attached.
                            That holds even for systems that did not
                            request ARF reports, assuming such
                            reports are generated considering the possibility
                            of recipients that don't use automated ARF
                            parsing.  Anyone sending unsolicited
                            reports in ARF can legitimately
                            presume that some recipients will only be
                            able to access the human-readable (first,
                            text/plain) part of it and SHOULD include
                            all information needed also in this part.
                            Further, they SHOULD ensure that the
                            report is readable when viewed as plain
                            text, to give low-end ticketing systems as
                            much assistance as possible.  In extreme
                            cases, failure to take these steps may result
                            in the report being discarded or ignored. </t>

                            identify bulk email senders. </t>

                        <t> Per Section 4.4 of
                            <xref target="RFC6449"/>, a network
                            service provider MAY use ARF data for
                            automated forwarding of feedback messages
                            to the originating customer. </t> 

                        <t> Published abuse mailbox addresses SHOULD
                            NOT reject non-ARF messages based solely on
                            the format, as generation of ARF messages can
                            occasionally be unavailable or not
                            applicable.  Deviation from this requirement
                            could be done due to local policy decisions
                            regarding other message criteria. </t>

                        <t> Although <xref target="RFC6449"/> suggests
                            that replying to feedback is not useful,
                            in the case of receipt of ARF reports
                            where no feedback arrangement has been
                            established, a non-automated reply might be
                            desirable to indicate what action resulted
                            from the complaint, heading off more severe
                            filtering by the Feedback Provider.  In
                            addition, using an address that cannot
                            receive replies precludes any requests for
                            additional information and increases the
                            likelihood that further reports will be
                            discarded or blocked.  Thus, a Feedback
                            Provider sending unsolicited reports
                            SHOULD NOT generate reports for which a reply
                            cannot be received.  Where an
                            unsolicited report results in the
                            establishment of contact with a
                            responsible and responsive party, this data
                            can be saved for future complaint handling and
                            possible establishment of a formal
                            (solicited) feedback arrangement.  See

        <section title="Generating Automatic Authentication Failure Reports"
                 anchor="auth_failure">

                <t> There are some cases where report generation is
                    caused by automation rather than user requests.
                    A specific example of this is reporting, using
                    ARF (or extensions to it), of messages
                    that fail particular message authentication checks.
                    Examples of this include
                    <xref target="RFC6651"/> 
                    and <xref target="RFC6652"/>.
                    The considerations presented below apply in those
                    cases. </t>

                <t> The applicability statement for this use case
                    is somewhat smaller, as many of the issues
                    associated with abuse reports are not relevant
                    to reports about authentication failures. </t>

                        <t> Automatic feedback generators MUST select actual
                            message recipients based on data provided by
                            willing report receivers.  In particular,
                            recipients MUST NOT be selected using
                            heuristics. </t>

                        <t> If the message under evaluation by the
                            Verifier is an ARF <xref target="RFC5965"/>
                            message, a report MUST NOT be automatically
                            generated. </t>

                        <t> The message for a new report sent via SMTP MUST
                            be constructed so as to avoid amplification
                            attacks, deliberate or otherwise.  The envelope
                            sender address of the report MUST be chosen so
                            that these reports will not generate mail loops.
                            Similar to Section 2 of <xref target="RFC3464"/>,
                            the envelope sender address of the report MUST be
                            chosen to ensure that no feedback reports will
                            be issued in response to the report itself.
                            Therefore, when an SMTP transaction is used to send
                            a report, the MAIL FROM command SHOULD use the
                            NULL reverse-path, i.e., "MAIL FROM:<>".  An
                            exception to this would be the use of a
                            reverse-path selected such that SPF checks on
                            the report will pass; in such cases, the operator
                            will need to make provisions to avoid the
                            amplification attack or mail loop via other
                            means. </t>

                        <t> Reports SHOULD use
                            "Feedback-Type: auth-failure" but MAY use
                            other types as appropriate.  However, the
                            Mailbox Provider generating the reports
                            cannot assume that the operator
                            receiving the reports will treat different
                            Feedback-Types differently. </t>

                        <t> These reports SHOULD include the following
                            fields, although they are optional
                            in <xref target="RFC5965"/>, whenever their
                            corresponding values are available:
                            Original-Mail-From, Arrival-Date,
                            Source-IP, and Original&nbhy;Rcpt-To.  Other
                            optional fields can be included as deemed
                            appropriate by the implementer. </t>

                        <t> Feedback Providers that relay user
                            complaints directly, rather than by
                            reference to a stored message (e.g.,
                            IMAP or POP), could be duped into sending
                            a complaint about a message that the
                            complaining user never actually received,
                            as an attack on the purported originator
                            of the falsified message.  Feedback
                            Providers need to be resilient to such
                            attack methods. </t>

                        <t> Also, these reports may be forged as
                            easily as ordinary Internet electronic
                            mail.  User agents and automatic mail
                            handling facilities (such as mail
                            distribution list exploders) that wish
                            to make automatic use of reports of any
                            kind should take appropriate precautions
                            to minimize the potential damage from
                            denial-of-service attacks. </t>

                        <t> Perhaps the simplest means of mitigating
                            this threat is to assert that these
                            reports should themselves be signed with
                            something like DKIM and/or authorized by something
                            like SPF.  Note, however, that if there is a
                            problem with the email infrastructure at either
                            end, DKIM and/or SPF may result in reports that
                            aren't trusted or even accepted by their intended
                            recipients, so it is important to make sure those
                            components are properly configured.  The use of
                            both technologies in tandem can resolve this
                            concern to a degree, since they generally have
                            disjoint failure modes. </t>

                            historically been generated individually
                            as a result of some kind of human request,
                            such as someone clicking a "Report Abuse"
                            button in a mail reader.  In contrast, the
                            mechanisms described in some extension
                            documents (i.e., <xref target="RFC6651"/>

                            are focused around automated reporting.
                            This obviously implies the potential for
                            much larger volumes or higher frequency of
                            messages, and thus greater mail system

                        <t> Those mechanisms are primarily intended

                            volume of messages requesting reports
                            whose signatures fail to validate, as
                            the Feedback Provider now needs to send

                        <t> In general ARF feedback loop terms, it is
                            often suggested that Feedback Providers
                            only create these (or any) ARF reports
                            after an out-of-band arrangement has been

                            authorized abuse report feedback loop that is
                            configured and activated by private agreement.
                            The alternative (sending reports automatically
                            based solely on data found in the messages)
                            may have unintended consequences.</t>

                            representing a number of identical or
                            nearly identical incidents.  One might
                            even do something inverse-exponentially,
                            sending reports for each of the first ten
                            incidents, then every tenth incident up
                            to 100, then every 100th incident up to
                            1000, etc., until some period of relative
                            quiet after which the limitation
                            resets. </t>

                        <t> The use of this technique for "nearly identical"
                            incidents in particular causes a
                            degradation in reporting quality, however.
                            If for example a large number of pieces of
                            spam arrive from one attacker, a reporting
                            agent could decide only to send a report
                            about a fraction of those messages.  While
                            this averts a flood of reports to a
                            system administrator, the precise details
                            of each incident are similarly not
                            sent. </t>

                        <t> Other rate-limiting provisions might be
                            considered, such as detecting a
                            temporary failure response from the report
                            destination and thus halting report
                            generation to that destination for some
                            period, or simply imposing or negotiating
                            a hard limit on the number of reports to
                            be sent to a particular receiver in a
                            given time frame. </t>
