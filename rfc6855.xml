        <abstract>
            <t>This specification extends the Internet Message Access Protocol
                   version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1) to support UTF-8 encoded international
                   characters in user names, mail addresses, and message headers.
                This specification replaces RFC 5738.</t>

        <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
            <t> This specification forms part of the Email Address Internationalization
 protocols described in the <xref target="RFC6530">Email Address Internationalization Framework
document</xref>. It extends IMAP4rev1 <xref target="RFC3501"/> to permit UTF-8
                   <xref target="RFC3629"/> in headers, as described in "Internationalized Email
                   Headers" <xref target="RFC6532"/>.  It also adds a mechanism to support mailbox
                   names using the UTF-8 charset.  This
                   specification creates two new IMAP capabilities to allow servers to
                   advertise these new extensions.</t>
          
            <t> This specification assumes that the IMAP server
    will be operating in a fully internationalized environment,
    i.e., one in which all clients accessing the server will be
    able to accept non-ASCII message header fields and other
    information, as specified in <xref target="utf8-accept"/>.  At least during a
    transition period, that assumption will not be realistic
    for many environments; the issues involved are discussed in
    <xref target="legacy"/> below.

                  <t>
                     This specification replaces an earlier, experimental approach to the
   same problem <xref target="RFC5738"/>.

        <section anchor="utf8-accept"
                 title="UTF8=ACCEPT IMAP Capability and UTF-8 in IMAP Quoted-Strings">

                <t>The "UTF8=ACCEPT" capability indicates that the server supports the
   ability to open mailboxes containing internationalized messages with
   the "SELECT" and "EXAMINE" commands, and the server can provide UTF-8 responses to the "LIST" and
   "LSUB" commands. This capability also affects other IMAP extensions that can return 
mailbox names
or their prefixes, such as NAMESPACE <xref target="RFC2342"/> and ACL <xref target="RFC4314"/>.


</t>

<t>
   The "UTF8=ONLY" capability, described in <xref target="utf8-only"/>, implies the
   "UTF8=ACCEPT" capability.  A server is said to support "UTF8=ACCEPT"
   if it advertises either "UTF8=ACCEPT" or "UTF8=ONLY".
</t>

<t>
   A client MUST use the "ENABLE" command (defined in <xref target="RFC5161"/>) with
   the "UTF8=ACCEPT" option (defined in <xref target="utf8-append"/> below) to indicate to
   the server that the client accepts UTF-8 in quoted-strings and
   supports the "UTF8=ACCEPT" extension.  The "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" command
   is only valid in the authenticated state.
</t>
<t>
   The IMAP4rev1 base specification (<xref target="RFC3501"/>) forbids the use of 8-bit
   characters in atoms or quoted-strings.  Thus, a UTF-8 string can only
   be sent as a literal.  This can be inconvenient from a coding
   standpoint, and unless the server offers IMAP4 non-synchronizing
   literals <xref target="RFC2088"/>, this requires an extra round trip for each UTF-8
   string sent by the client.  When the IMAP server supports "UTF8=ACCEPT"
   it supports UTF-8 in quoted-strings with the following syntax:
</t>
<figure>
                    <artwork>
         quoted        =/ DQUOTE *uQUOTED-CHAR DQUOTE
                ; QUOTED-CHAR is not modified, as it will affect
                ; other RFC 3501 ABNF non-terminals.

         uQUOTED-CHAR  = QUOTED-CHAR / UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4

         UTF8-2        =   &lt;Defined in Section 4 of RFC 3629>

         UTF8-3        =   &lt;Defined in Section 4 of RFC 3629>

         UTF8-4        =   &lt;Defined in Section 4 of RFC 3629>
</artwork>
                    </figure>
<t>
   When this extended quoting mechanism is used by the client, then the
   server MUST reject, with a "BAD" response, any octet sequences with the
   high bit set that fail to comply with the formal syntax in <xref target="RFC3629"/>.
   The IMAP server MUST NOT send UTF-8 in quoted-strings to the client
   unless the client has indicated support for that syntax by using the
   "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" command.

</t>

<t>
    If the server supports "UTF8=ACCEPT", the client MAY use extended
    quoted syntax with any IMAP argument that permits a string (including
    astring and nstring).
    However, if characters outside the
    US-ASCII repertoire are used in an inappropriate place, the results
    would be the same as if other syntactically valid but semantically
    invalid characters were used.  Specific cases where UTF-8 characters
    are permitted or not permitted are described in the following
    paragraphs.
</t>

    <t>
    All IMAP servers that support "UTF8=ACCEPT" SHOULD accept UTF-8 in
    mailbox names, and those that also support the  
    Mailbox International Naming Convention described in RFC 3501,
    Section 5.1.3, MUST accept UTF8-quoted mailbox names and convert them
    to the appropriate internal format.  Mailbox names MUST comply with
    the Net-Unicode Definition (<xref target="RFC5198"/>, Section 2) with the specific
    exception that they MUST NOT contain control characters (0000-001F and
    0080-009F), a delete character (007F), a line separator (2028), or a paragraph
    separator (2029).</t>


    <t>
 Once an IMAP client has enabled UTF-8 support with the
   "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" command, it MUST NOT issue a "SEARCH"
   command that contains a charset specification.  If an IMAP server
   receives such a "SEARCH" command in that situation,

it SHOULD reject the command
    with a "BAD" response (due to the conflicting charset labels).
</t>
                
            
        </section>

        <section anchor="utf8-append" title="IMAP UTF8 Append Data Extension">
<t>
   If the server supports "UTF8=ACCEPT", then the server accepts UTF-8
   headers in the "APPEND" command message argument.
                           A client that sends a message with UTF-8 headers to the server MUST
                           send them using the "UTF8=APPEND" data extension.  If the server also
                           advertises the CATENATE capability (as specified in <xref target="RFC4469"/>), the
                           client can use the same data extension to include such a message in a
                           CATENATE message part.  The ABNF for the APPEND data extension and
                           CATENATE extension follows:
</t>
                <figure>
                    <artwork>
     utf8-literal   = "UTF8" SP "(" literal8 ")"
     
     literal8   = &lt;Defined in RFC 4466>

     append-data    =/ utf8-literal

     cat-part       =/ utf8-literal
                 </artwork>
                    </figure>

            
                    <t>
   If an IMAP server supports "UTF8=ACCEPT" and the IMAP client has not
   issued the "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" command, the server MUST reject, with
   a "NO" response, an "APPEND" command that includes any 8-bit character
   in message header fields.
                    </t>

                
        </section>
        
        <section anchor="login-command" title="LOGIN Command and UTF-8">
                <t>                  
                 This specification doesn't extend the IMAP "LOGIN" command <xref target="RFC3501"/>
    to support UTF-8 usernames and passwords. Whenever a client needs
    to use UTF-8 username/passwords, it MUST use the IMAP "AUTHENTICATE"
    command, which is already capable of passing UTF-8 usernames and 
credentials.


                </t>
                
                
                  <t>  Although the use of
the IMAP "AUTHENTICATE" command in this way makes it syntactically legal to have a UTF-8 username
   or password, there is no guarantee that the user provisioning system utilized
   by the IMAP server will allow such identities. This is an
   implementation decision and may depend on what identity system the
   IMAP server is configured to use.</t>
        </section>



        <section anchor="utf8-only" title="&quot;UTF8=ONLY&quot; Capability">
<t>
   The "UTF8=ONLY" capability indicates that the server supports
   "UTF8=ACCEPT" (see <xref target="utf8-append"/>) and that it requires support
   for UTF-8 from clients.  In particular, this means that the server will send UTF-8 in
   quoted-strings, and it will not accept the older international
   mailbox name convention (modified UTF-7).  Because these are
   incompatible changes to IMAP, explicit server announcement and
   client confirmation is necessary: clients MUST use the "ENABLE
   UTF8=ACCEPT" command before using this server. A server that
   advertises "UTF8=ONLY" will reject, with a "NO [CANNOT]" response <xref target="RFC5530" />,
   any command that might require UTF-8 support and is not preceded by an
   "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" command.
</t>
<t>     
   IMAP clients that find support for a server that announces
   "UTF8=ONLY" problematic are encouraged to at least detect the
   announcement and provide an informative error message to the
   end-user.
</t>
<t>     
   Because the "UTF8=ONLY" server capability includes support for
   "UTF8=ACCEPT", the capability string will include, at most, one of
   those and never both.  For the client, "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" is
   always used -- never "ENABLE UTF8-ONLY".
</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="legacy" title=" Dealing with Legacy Clients">
                <t>     In most situations, it will be difficult or impossible for
    the implementer or operator of an IMAP (or POP) server to
    know whether all of the clients that might access it, or
    the associated mail store more generally, will be able to
    support the facilities defined in this document.  In almost
    all cases, servers who conform to this specification will
    have to be prepared to deal with clients that do not enable
    the relevant capabilities.  Unfortunately, there is no
    completely satisfactory way to do so other than for systems
    that wish to receive email that requires SMTPUTF8
    capabilities to be sure that all components of those
    systems -- including IMAP and other clients selected by
    users -- are upgraded appropriately.


</t>
               
   <t> 
       When a message that requires SMTPUTF8
   is encountered and the client doesn't enable UTF-8 capability, choices available to the server include
   hiding the problematic message(s), creating in-band or out-of-band
   notifications or error messages, or somehow trying to create a
   variation on the message with the intention of providing useful
   information to that client about what has occurred.  Such variant
   messages cannot be actual substitutes for the original message:
they will almost always be impossible to reply to (either at
     all or without loss of information).  The new header fields or
    specialized constructs  for server-client communication
    may go beyond the requirements of, e.g., RFC 5322; they may
    consequently confuse some legacy mail user agents
    (including IMAP clients) or otherwise may not provide the
    expected information to users.  
    
    There are also trade-offs in
    constructing variants of the original message between
    accepting complexity and additional computation costs in
    order to try to preserve as much information as possible
    (for example, in <xref target="RFC6857"/>) and
    trying to minimize those costs while still providing useful
    information (for example, in
    <xref target="RFC6858"/>). 
</t>

  <t> 


   Implementations that choose to perform downgrading SHOULD use one
   of the standardized algorithms: <xref target="RFC6857"/>  or
   <xref target="RFC6858"/>.  Getting downgrade algorithms right,
   and minimizing the risk of operational problems and harm to the email
   system, is tricky and requires careful engineering.  These two
   algorithms are well understood and carefully designed.

</t>
   <t>Because such messages are really variations of the original
    ones, not really "downgraded" ones (although that
    terminology is often used for convenience), they inevitably
    have relationships to the originals that the IMAP
    specification <xref target="RFC3501"/> did not anticipate. 

This brings up two concerns in particular:

   First, digital signatures computed over and intended for the original
   message will often not be applicable to the variant message, and
   will often fail signature verification.  (It will be possible for some
   digital signatures to be verified, if they cover only parts of the
   original message that are not affected in the creation of the variant.)

   Second, servers that
   may be accessed by the same user with different clients or methods
   (e.g., POP or webmail systems in addition to IMAP or IMAP clients
   with different capabilities) will need to exert extreme care to be
   sure that UIDVALIDITY behaves as the user would expect.



    Those issues may be especially
    sensitive if the server caches the variant message or
    computes and stores it when the message arrives with the
    intent of making either form available depending on client
    capabilities. 
    
    Additionally, in order to cope with the case when a server compliant 
with this
extension returns the same UIDVALIDITY to both legacy and 
"UTF8=ACCEPT"-aware clients,
a client upgraded from being non-"UTF8=ACCEPT"-aware MUST discard its cache of 
messages
downloaded from the server.


</t>
   <t> The best (or "least bad") approach for any given
    environment will depend on local conditions, local
    assumptions about user behavior, the degree of control the
    server operator has over client usage and upgrading, the
    options that are actually available, and so on.  It is
    impossible, at least at the time of publication of this specification, to give good advice that
    will apply to all situations, or even particular profiles
    of situations, other than "upgrade legacy clients as soon
    as possible".

<t>
    When an IMAP server uses a mailbox format that supports UTF-8 headers
    and it permits selection or examination of that mailbox without
    issuing "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" first, it is the
    responsibility of the server to comply
    with the IMAP4rev1 base specification <xref target="RFC3501"/> and <xref target="RFC5322"/> with
    respect to all header information transmitted over the wire.

   predecessor to this document ("UTF8=ALL", "UTF8=APPEND", "UTF8=USER")
   are now made OBSOLETE.  IANA has updated  the "IMAP 4
   Capabilities" registry as follows:

                <t>   The security considerations of UTF-8 <xref target="RFC3629"/> and SASLprep <xref target="RFC4013"/>
   apply to this specification, particularly with respect to use of
   UTF-8 in usernames and passwords.  Otherwise, this is not believed

                              <t>Special considerations, some of them with security
    implications, occur if a server that conforms to this
    specification is accessed by a client that does not, as well as in some more complex
situations in which a given message is
    accessed by multiple clients that might use different
    protocols and/or support different capabilities.  Those
    issues are discussed in <xref target="legacy"/>.

<title>Post-Delivery Message Downgrading for Internationalized Email Messages</title>

<abstract><t>The Email Address Internationalization (SMTPUTF8) extension to SMTP allows UTF-8 characters in mail header fields.  Upgraded POP and IMAP servers support internationalized Email messages.  If a POP/IMAP client does not support Email Address Internationalization, POP/IMAP servers cannot deliver Internationalized Email Headers to the client and cannot remove the message.  To avoid the situation, this document describes a conversion mechanism for internationalized Email messages to be in traditional message format.  In the process, message elements requiring internationalized treatment are recoded or removed and receivers are able to know that they received messages containing such elements even if they cannot process the internationalized elements.</t></abstract>

        <section anchor="rationale" title="Design Rationale">
                <t> This non-normative section discusses the reasons behind some of the
   design choices in this specification.</t>
           <t>   The basic approach of advertising the ability to access a mailbox in
   UTF-8 mode is intended to permit graceful upgrade, including servers
   that support multiple mailbox formats.  In particular, it would be
   undesirable to force conversion of an entire server mailstore to
   UTF-8 headers, so being able to phase in support for new mailboxes
   and gradually migrate old mailboxes is permitted by this design.</t>
          
    
           <t>   The "UTF8=ONLY" mechanism simplifies diagnosis of interoperability
   problems when legacy support goes away.  In the situation where
   backwards compatibility is not working anyway, "just-send-UTF-8 IMAP" has
   the advantage that it might work with some legacy clients.  However,
   the difficulty of diagnosing interoperability problems caused by a
   "just-send-UTF-8 IMAP" mechanism is the reason the "UTF8=ONLY"
   capability mechanism was chosen.
