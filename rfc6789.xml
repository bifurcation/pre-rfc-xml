      <t>This document provides the entry point to the set of documentation
      about the Congestion Exposure (ConEx) protocol. It explains the
      motivation for including a ConEx marking at the IP layer: to expose
      information about congestion to network nodes. Although such information
      may have a number of uses, this document focuses on how the information
      communicated by the ConEx marking can serve as the basis for
      significantly more efficient and effective traffic management than what
      exists on the Internet today.</t>

    <section anchor="conex-uses-intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>The power of Internet technology comes from multiplexing shared
      capacity with packets rather than circuits. Network operators aim to
      provide sufficient shared capacity, but when too much packet load meets
      too little shared capacity, congestion results. 
Congestion appears as either increased delay, dropped packets, or packets
explicitly marked with Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) markings <xref
target="RFC3168"></xref>. As described in <xref
      target="conex-uses_Fig_ConEx_Placement"></xref>, congestion control
      currently relies on the transport receiver detecting these 'Congestion
      Signals' and informing the transport sender in 'Congestion Feedback
      Signals'. The sender is then expected to reduce its rate in
      response.</t>

      <t>This document provides the entry point to the set of documentation
      about the Congestion Exposure (ConEx) protocol. It focuses on the
      motivation for including a ConEx marking at the IP layer. (A companion
      document, <xref target="CONEX-ABS"></xref>, focuses
      on the mechanics of the protocol.) Briefly, the idea is for the sender
      to continually signal expected congestion in the headers of any data it
      sends. To a first approximation, the sender does this by relaying the
      'Congestion Feedback Signals' back into the IP layer. They then travel
      unchanged across the network to the receiver (shown as
      'IP-Layer-ConEx-Signals' in <xref
      target="conex-uses_Fig_ConEx_Placement"></xref>). This enables IP-layer
      devices on the path to see information about the whole-path
      congestion.</t>

      <t>One of the key benefits of exposing this congestion information at
      the IP layer is that it makes the information available to network
      operators for use as input into their traffic management procedures. A
      ConEx-enabled sender signals expected whole-path congestion, which is
      approximately the congestion at least a round-trip time earlier as
      reported by the receiver to the sender (<xref
      target="conex-uses_Fig_ConEx_Placement"></xref>). The ConEx signal is a
      mark in the IP header that is easy for any IP device to read. Therefore,
      a node performing traffic management can count congestion as easily as
      it might count data volume today by simply counting the volume of
      packets with ConEx markings.</t>

      <t>ConEx-based traffic management can make highly efficient use of
      capacity. In times of no congestion, all traffic management restraints
      can be removed, leaving the network's full capacity available to all its
      users. If some users on the network cause disproportionate congestion,
      the traffic management function can learn about this and directly limit
      those users' traffic in order to protect the service of other users
      sharing the same capacity. ConEx-based traffic management thus presents
      a step change in terms of the options available to network operators for
      managing traffic on their networks.</t>

      <t>The remainder of this document explains the concepts behind ConEx and
      how exposing congestion can significantly improve Internet traffic
      management, among other benefits. <xref target="concepts"></xref>
      introduces a number of concepts that are fundamental to understanding
      how ConEx-based traffic management works. <xref
      target="traffic-management"></xref> shows how ConEx can be used for
      traffic management, discusses additional benefits from such usage, and
      compares ConEx-based traffic management to existing traffic management
      approaches. <xref target="other-use-cases"></xref> discusses other
      related use cases. <xref target="deployments"></xref> briefly discusses
      deployment arrangements. <xref target="experimental"></xref> suggests open issues that experiments
in the use of ConEx could usefully be designed to answer. The final sections are standard RFC back
      matter.</t>

    <section anchor="concepts" title="Concepts">
      <t>ConEx relies on a precise definition of congestion and a number of
      newer concepts that are introduced in this
      section. Definitions are summarized in <xref target="definitions" />.</t>

      <section anchor="congestion" title="Congestion">
        <t>Despite its central role in network control and management,
        congestion is a remarkably difficult concept to define. Experts in
        different disciplines and with different perspectives define
        congestion in a variety of ways <xref target="Bauer09"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The definition used for the purposes of ConEx is expressed as the
        probability of packet loss (or the probability of packet marking if
        ECN is in use). This definition focuses on how congestion is measured,
        rather than describing congestion as a condition or state.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="congestion-volume" title="Congestion-Volume">
        <t>The metric that ConEx exposes is congestion-volume: the volume of
        bytes dropped or ECN-marked in a given period of time. Counting
        congestion-volume allows each user to be held responsible for his or
        her contribution to congestion. Congestion-volume can only be a
        property of traffic, whereas congestion can be a property of traffic
        or a property of a link or a path.</t>

        <t>To understand congestion-volume, consider a simple example. Imagine
        Alice sends 1 GB of a file while the loss-probability is a constant
        0.2%. Her contribution to congestion -- her congestion-volume -- is
        1 GB x 0.2% = 2 MB. If she then sends another 3 GB of the file while the
        loss-probability is 0.1%, this adds 3 MB to her congestion-volume. Her
        total contribution to congestion is then 2 MB + 3 MB = 5 MB.</t>

        <t>Fortunately, measuring Alice's congestion-volume on a real network
        does not require the kind of arithmetic shown above, because
        congestion-volume can be directly measured by counting the total
        volume of Alice's traffic that gets discarded or ECN-marked. (A queue
        with varying percentage loss does these multiplications and additions
        inherently.) With ConEx, network operators can count congestion-volume
        using techniques very similar to those they use for counting
        volume.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="upstream-downstream-congestion"
               title="Rest-of-Path Congestion">
        <t>At a particular measurement point within a network, "rest-of-path
        congestion" (also known as "downstream congestion") is the level of
        congestion that a traffic flow is expected to experience between the
        measurement point and its final destination. "Upstream congestion" is
        the congestion experienced up to the measurement point.</t>

        <t>If traffic is ECN-capable, ECN signals monitored in the middle of a
        network will indicate the congestion experienced so far on the path
        (upstream congestion). In contrast, the ConEx signals inserted into IP
        headers as shown in <xref
        target="conex-uses_Fig_ConEx_Placement"></xref> indicate the
        congestion along a whole path from transport source to transport
        destination. Therefore, if a measurement point detects both of these
        signals, it can subtract the level of ECN (upstream congestion) from
        the level of ConEx (whole path) to derive a measure of the congestion
        that packets are likely to experience between the monitoring point and
        their destination (rest-of-path congestion). A measurement point can calculate this measurement in the aggregate, across all flows.</t>

        <t>A network monitor can usually accurately measure upstream congestion only if the traffic it observes is ECN-capable. <xref
        target="CONEX-ABS"></xref> further discusses
        the constraints around the network's ability to measure upstream
        and rest-of-path congestion in these circumstances. However, there are a number of initial deployment
        arrangements that benefit from ConEx but work without ECN (see <xref
        target="deployments"></xref>).</t>

            the purposes of ConEx, congestion is measured using the concrete
            signals provided by loss and ECN markings (delay is not
            considered). Congestion is measured as the probability of loss or

    <section anchor="traffic-management"
             title="Core Use Case: Informing Traffic Management">
      <t>This section explains how ConEx could be used as the basis for
      traffic management, highlights additional benefits derived from having
      ConEx-aware nodes on the network, and compares ConEx-based traffic
      management to existing approaches.</t>

      <section anchor="using-conex" title="Use Case Description">
        <t>One of the key benefits that ConEx can deliver is in helping
        network operators to improve how they manage traffic on their
        networks. Consider the common case of a commercial broadband network
        where a relatively small number of users place disproportionate demand
        on network resources, at times resulting in congestion. The network
        operator seeks a way to manage traffic such that the traffic that
        contributes more to congestion bears more of the brunt of the
        management.</t>

        <t>Assuming ConEx signals are visible at the IP layer, the network
        operator can accomplish this by placing a congestion policer at an
        enforcement point within the network and configuring it with a traffic
        management policy that monitors each user's contribution to
        congestion. As described in <xref
        target="CONEX-ABS"></xref> and elaborated in <xref
        target="CongPol"></xref>, one way to implement a congestion policer is
        in a similar way to a bit-rate policer, except that it monitors
        congestion-volume (based on IP-layer ConEx signals) rather than
        bit rate. When implemented as a token bucket, the tokens provide users
        with the right to cause bits of congestion-volume, rather than to send
        bits of data volume. The fill rate represents each user's
        congestion-volume quota.</t>

        <t>The congestion policer monitors the ConEx signals of the traffic
        entering the network. As long as the network remains uncongested and
        users stay within their quotas, no action is taken. When the network
        becomes congested and a user exhausts his quota, some action is taken
        against the traffic that breached the quota in accordance with the
        network operator's traffic management policy. For example, the traffic
        may be dropped, delayed, or marked with a lower QoS class. In this
        way, traffic is managed according to its contribution to congestion --
        not some application- or flow-specific policy -- and is not managed at
        all during times of no congestion.</t>

        <t>As an example of how a network operator might employ a ConEx-based
        traffic management system, consider a typical DSL network architecture
        (as elaborated in <xref target="TR-059"></xref> and <xref
        target="TR-101"></xref>). Traffic is routed from regional and global
        IP networks to an operator-controlled IP node, the Broadband Remote
        Access Server (BRAS). From the BRAS, traffic is delivered to access
        nodes. The BRAS carries enhanced functionality, including IP QoS and
        traffic management capabilities.</t>

        <t>By deploying a congestion policer at the BRAS location, the network
        operator can measure the congestion-volume created by users within the
        access nodes and police misbehaving users before their traffic affects
        others on the access network. The policer would be provisioned with a
        traffic management policy, perhaps directing the BRAS to drop packets
        from users that exceed their congestion-volume quotas during times of
        congestion. Those users' apps would be likely to react in the typical
        way to drops, backing off (assuming at least some use TCP), and
        thereby lowering the users' congestion-volumes back within the quota
        limits. If none of a user's apps responds, the policer would continue
        to increase focused drops and effectively enforce its own congestion
        control.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="additional-benefits" title="Additional Benefits">
        <t>The ConEx-based approach to traffic management has a number of
        benefits in addition to efficient management of traffic. It provides
        incentives for users to make use of "scavenger" transport protocols,
        such as the Low Extra Delay Background Transport <xref target="LEDBAT"></xref>, that
        provide ways for bulk-transfer applications to rapidly yield when
        interactive applications require capacity (thereby "scavenging"
        remaining bandwidth). With a congestion policer in place as described
        in <xref target="using-conex"></xref>, users of these protocols will
        be less likely to run afoul of the network operator's traffic
        management policy than those whose bulk-transfer applications generate
        the same volume of traffic without being sensitive to congestion. In short,
        two users who produce similar traffic volumes over the same
        time interval may produce different congestion-volumes if one of them
        is using a scavenger transport protocol and the other is not; in that
        situation, the scavenger user's traffic is less likely to be managed by
        the network operator.</t>

        <t>ConEx-based traffic management also makes it possible for a user to
        control the relative performance among its own traffic flows. If a
        user wants some flows to have more bandwidth than others, it can
        reduce the rate of some traffic so that it consumes less
        congestion-volume "budget", leaving more congestion-volume "budget" for the
        user to "spend" on making other traffic go faster. This approach is
        most relevant if congestion is signalled by ECN, because no impairment
        due to loss is involved and delay can remain low.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="comparison" title="Comparison with Existing Approaches">
        <t>A variety of approaches already exist for network operators to
        manage congestion, traffic, and the disproportionate usage of scarce
        capacity by a small number of users. Common approaches can be
        categorized as rate-based, volume-based, or application-based.</t>

        <t>Rate-based approaches constrain the traffic rate per user or per
        network. A user's peak and average (or "committed") rate may be
        limited. These approaches have the potential to either over- or
        under-constrain the network, suppressing rates even when the network
        is uncongested or not suppressing them enough during heavy usage
        periods.</t>

        <t>Round-robin scheduling and fair queuing were developed to address
        these problems. They equalize relative rates between active users (or
        flows) at a known bottleneck. The bit rate allocated to any one user
        depends on the number of active users at each instant. The drawback of
        these approaches is that they favor heavy users over light users over
        time, because they do not have any memory of usage. These approaches
share bit rate instant by instant; however, heavy users are active at every
instant, whereas light users only occupy their share of the link occasionally.
</t>

        <t>Volume-based approaches measure the overall volume of traffic a
        user sends (and/or receives) over time. Users may be subject to an
        absolute volume cap (for example, 10GB per month) or the "heaviest"
        users may be sanctioned in some other manner. Many providers use
        monthly volume limits, and count volume regardless of whether the
        network is congested or not, creating the potential for over- or
        under-constraining problems, as with the original rate-based
        approaches.</t>

        <t>ConEx-based approaches, by comparison, only react during times of
        congestion and in proportion to each user's congestion contribution,
        making more efficient use of capacity and more proportionate
        management decisions.</t>

        <t>Unlike ConEx-based approaches, neither rate-based nor volume-based
        approaches provide incentives for applications to use scavenger
        transport protocols. They may even penalize users of applications that
        employ scavenger transports for the large amount of volume they send,
        rather than rewarding them for carefully avoiding congestion while
        sending it. While the volume-based approach described in "Comcast's
        Protocol-Agnostic Congestion Management System" <xref
        target="RFC6057"></xref> aims to overcome the over-/under-constraining
        problem by only measuring volume and triggering traffic management
        action during periods of high utilization, it still does not provide
        incentives to use scavenger transports, because congestion-causing
        volume cannot be distinguished from volume overall. ConEx provides
        this ability.</t>

        <t>Application-based approaches use deep packet inspection or other
        techniques to determine what application a given traffic flow is
        associated with. Network operators may then use this information to
        rate-limit or otherwise sanction certain applications, in some cases
        only during peak hours. These approaches suffer from being at odds
        with IPsec and some application-layer encryption, and they may raise
        additional policy concerns. In contrast, ConEx offers an
        application-agnostic metric to serve as the basis for traffic
        management decisions.</t>

        <t>The existing types of approaches share a further limitation that
        ConEx can help to overcome: performance uncertainty. Flat-rate pricing
        plans are popular because users appreciate the certainty of having
        their monthly bill amount remain the same for each billing period,
        allowing them to plan their costs accordingly. But while flat-rate
        pricing avoids billing uncertainty, it creates performance
        uncertainty: users cannot know whether the performance of their
        connections is being altered or degraded based on how the network
        operator is attempting to manage congestion. By exposing congestion
        information at the IP layer, ConEx instead provides a metric that can
        serve as an open, transparent basis for traffic management policies
        that both providers and their customers can measure and verify.
It can be used to reduce the performance uncertainty that some users currently
experience, without having to sacrifice their billing certainty.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="other-use-cases" title="Other Use Cases">
      <t>ConEx information can be put to a number of uses other than informing
      traffic management. These include:</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Informing inter-operator contracts:">ConEx information
          is made visible to every IP node, including border nodes between
          networks. Network operators can use ConEx combined with ECN markings
          to measure how much traffic from each network contributes to
          congestion in the other. As such, congestion-volume could be
          included as a metric in inter-operator contracts, just as volume or
          bit rate are included today. This would not be an initial deployment
          scenario, unless ECN became widely deployed.</t>

          <t hangText="Enabling more efficient capacity provisioning:"><xref
          target="additional-benefits"></xref> explains how operators can use
          ConEx-based traffic management to encourage use of scavenger
          transport protocols, which significantly improves the performance of
          interactive applications while still allowing heavy users to
          transfer high volumes. Here we explain how this can also benefit
          network operators.<vspace blankLines="1" />Today, when loss, delay,
          or average utilization exceeds a certain threshold, some operators
          just buy more capacity without attempting to manage the traffic.
          Other operators prefer to limit a minority of heavy users at peak
          times, but they still eventually buy more capacity when utilization
          rises.<vspace blankLines="1" />With ConEx-based traffic management,
          a network operator should be able to provision capacity more
          efficiently. An operator could benefit from this in a variety of
          ways. For example, the operator could add capacity as it would do
          without ConEx, but deliver better quality of service for its users.
          Or, the operator could delay adding capacity while delivering similar
          quality of service to what it currently provides.</t>

    <!-- ====================================================================== -->

    <section anchor="deployments" title="Deployment Arrangements">
      <t>ConEx is designed so that it can be incrementally deployed in the
      Internet and still be valuable for early adopters. As long as some
      senders are ConEx-enabled, a network on the path can unilaterally use
      ConEx-aware policy devices for traffic management; no changes to network
      forwarding elements are needed, and ConEx still works if there are other
      networks on the path that are unaware of ConEx marks.</t>

      <t>The above two steps seem to represent a stand-off where neither step
      is useful until the other has made the first move: i) some sending hosts
      must be modified to give information to the network, and ii) a network
      must deploy policy devices to monitor this information and act on it.
      Nonetheless, the developer of a scavenger transport protocol like LEDBAT
      does stand to benefit from deploying ConEx. In this case, the developer
      makes the first move, expecting it will prompt at least some networks to
      move in response, using the ConEx information to reward users of the
      scavenger transport protocol.</t>

      <t>On the host side, we have already shown (<xref
      target="conex-uses_Fig_ConEx_Placement"></xref>) how the sender
      piggy-backs ConEx signals on normal data packets to re-insert feedback
      about packet drops (and/or ECN) back into the IP layer. In the case of
      TCP, <xref target="TCP-MOD"></xref> proposes
      the required sender modifications. ConEx works with any TCP receiver as
      long as it uses SACK (selective acknowledgment), which most do. There is a receiver optimisation
      <xref target="TCPM-ECN"></xref> that improves ConEx
      precision when using ECN, but ConEx can still use ECN without it. Networks can make use of ConEx even if the implementations of some of the transport protocols on a host do not support ConEx (e.g., the implementation of DNS over UDP
	      might not support ConEx, while perhaps RTP over UDP and TCP will).</t>

      <t>On the network side, the provider solely needs to place ConEx
      congestion policers at each ingress to its network in a similar
      arrangement to the edge-policed architecture of Diffserv <xref
      target="RFC2475"></xref>.</t>

      <t>A sender can choose whether to send packets that support ConEx or
      packets that don't. ConEx-enabled packets bring information to the
      policer about congestion expected on the rest of the path beyond the
      policer. Packets that do not support ConEx bring no such information.
      Therefore, the network will tend to conservatively rate-limit
      non-ConEx-enabled packets in order to manage the unknown risk of
      congestion. In contrast, a network doesn't normally need to rate-limit
      ConEx-enabled packets unless they reveal a persistently high
      contribution to congestion. This natural tendency for networks to favour senders that provide
      ConEx information reinforces ConEx deployment.</t>

      <t>Feasible initial
      deployment scenarios exist for a broadband access network <xref target="CONEX-DEPLOY"></xref>, a
      mobile communications network <xref
      target="CONEX-MOBILE"></xref>, and a multi-tenant data centre
      <xref target="CONEX-DATA"></xref>. The first
      two of these scenarios are believed to work well without ECN support, 
while the data center scenario works best with ECN (and ECN can be deployed
unilaterally).</t>

      <t>The above gives only the most salient aspects of ConEx deployment.
      For further detail, <xref target="CONEX-ABS"></xref>
      describes the incremental deployment features of the ConEx protocol and
      the components that need to be deployed for ConEx to work.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="experimental" title="Experimental Considerations">
      <t>ConEx is initially designed as an experimental protocol because it
      makes an ambitious change at the interoperability (IP) layer, so no
      amount of careful design can foresee all the potential feature
      interactions with other uses of IP. This section identifies a number of
      questions that would be useful to answer through well-designed
      experiments:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Are the compromises that were made in order to fit the ConEx encoding into IP (for example, that the initial design was
          solely for IPv6 and not for IPv4, and that the encoding has limited visibility when tunnelled <xref
          target="CONEX-DESTOPT"></xref>) the right ones?</t>

          <t>Is it possible to combine techniques for distinguishing self-congestion from shared
          congestion with ConEx-based traffic management such that users are not penalized for congestion that does not impact others on the network? Are other
          techniques needed?</t>

          <t>In practice, how does traffic management using ConEx compare with
          traditional techniques (<xref target="comparison"></xref>)? Does it
          give the benefits claimed in Sections <xref target="using-conex" format="counter"></xref> and
          <xref target="additional-benefits" format="counter"></xref>?</t>

          <t>Approaches are proposed for congestion policing of ConEx traffic
          alongside existing management (or lack thereof) of non-ConEx traffic, including UDP traffic 	<xref
	          target="CONEX-ABS"></xref>. Are they
          strategy-proof against users selectively using both? Are there
          better transition strategies?</t>

          <t>Audit devices have been designed and implemented to assure ConEx
          signal integrity <xref
          target="CONEX-ABS"></xref>. Do they achieve
          minimal false hits and false misses in a wide range of traffic
          scenarios? Are there new attacks? Are there better audit designs to
          defend against these?</t>

          <t>If ECN deployment remains patchy, are the proposed initial ConEx
          deployment scenarios (<xref target="deployments"></xref>) still
          useful enough to kick-start deployment? Is auditing effective
          when based on loss at a primary bottleneck? Can rest-of-path
          congestion be approximated accurately enough without ECN? Are there other useful deployment scenarios?</t>

        </list></t>

      <t>ConEx is intended to be a generative technology that might be used
      for unexpected purposes unforeseen by the designers. Therefore, this list
      of experimental considerations is not intended to be exhaustive.</t>

<abstract><t>This document describes an abstract mechanism by which senders inform the network about the congestion encountered by packets earlier in the same flow.  Today, network elements at any layer may signal congestion to the receiver by dropping packets or by ECN markings, and the receiver passes this information back to the sender in transport-layer feedback.  The mechanism described here enables the sender to also relay this congestion information back into the network in-band at the IP layer, such that the total amount of congestion from all elements on the path is revealed to all IP elements along the path, where it could, for example, be used to provide input to traffic management.  This mechanism is called congestion exposure or ConEx.  The companion document "ConEx Concepts and Use Cases" provides the entry-point to the set of ConEx documentation.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is an IP/TCP mechanism where network nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate congestion to the end-points.  An ECN-capable receiver will feedback this information to the sender.  ECN is specified for TCP in such a way that only one feedback signal can be transmitted per Round-Trip Time (RTT).  Recently, new TCP mechanisms like ConEx or DCTCP need more accurate ECN feedback information in the case where more than one marking is received in one RTT.  This documents specifies a different scheme for the ECN feedback in the TCP header to provide more than one feedback signal per RTT.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>This document describes how a multi-tenant data centre operator can isolate tenants from network performance degradation due to each other's usage, but without losing the multiplexing benefits of a LAN- style network where anyone can use any amount of any resource.  Zero per-tenant configuration and no implementation change is required on network equipment.  Instead the solution is implemented with a simple change to the hypervisor (or container) on each physical server, beneath the tenant's virtual machines.  These collectively enforce a very simple distributed contract - a single network allowance that each tenant can allocate among their virtual machines.  The solution is simplest and most efficient using layer-3 switches that support explicit congestion notification (ECN) and if the sending operating system supports congestion exposure (ConEx).  Nonetheless, an arrangement is described so that the operator can unilaterally deploy a complete solution while operating systems are being incrementally upgraded to support ConEx.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>LEDBAT is an experimental delay-based congestion control algorithm that seeks to utilize the available bandwidth on an end-to-end path while limiting the consequent increase in queueing delay on that path.  LEDBAT uses changes in one-way delay measurements to limit congestion that the flow itself induces in the network.  LEDBAT is designed for use by background bulk-transfer applications to be no more aggressive than standard TCP congestion control (as specified in RFC5681) and to yield in the presence of competing flows, thus limiting interference with the network performance of competing flows.</t></abstract>
