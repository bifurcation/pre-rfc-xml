      <abstract>

        <t>This document revises all Enumservices that were IANA
          registered under the now obsolete specification of the
          Enumservice registry defined in RFC 3761.
        </t>

      </abstract>

    <section title='Introduction'>

      <t><xref target='RFC6117'/> has
      obsoleted the IANA registration section of
      <xref target='RFC3761'/>. Since the IANA Enumservice registry
      contains various Enumservices registered under the regime of RFC
      3761, those registrations do not conform to the new guidelines
      as specified in
      <xref target='RFC6117'/>. To ensure
      consistency among all Enumservice registrations at IANA, this
      document adds the (nowadays) missing elements to those legacy
      registrations.  Furthermore, all legacy Enumservice
      registrations are converted to the new XML-chunk format, and,
      where deemed necessary, minor editorial corrections are applied.
      </t>

      <t>However, this document only adds the missing elements to
      the XML chunks as specified in the IANA Considerations section
      of <xref target='RFC6117'/>, but it does
      not complete the (nowadays) missing sections of the
      corresponding Enumservice Specifications. In order to conform
      with the new registration regime as specified in
      <xref target='RFC6117'/>, those
      Enumservice Specifications still have to be revised.
      </t>

      <t>It is important to note that this document does not update
      the functional specification of the concerned Enumservices.</t>

      <t>The following RFCs are updated by this document:

    <section title="Terminology">

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
      in <xref target='RFC2119'>RFC 2119 </xref>.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title='IESG Action'>

      <t>According to <xref target='RFC3761'/>, any Enumservice
        registration had to be published as a Standards
        Track, Experimental, or BCP (Best Current Practice) RFC. <xref
target='RFC6117'/> no 
        longer has this requirement, i.e., "Specification Required", 
        which implies the use of a Designated Expert 
        <xref target='RFC5226' />, is sufficient. 
      </t>

      <t>This document changes the approval requirement for 
        updates to Enumservice registrations to Specification Required, whereby
        the specification and request are reviewed by a
        Designated Expert as described in
        <xref target='RFC6117'/>.

      <t>In the following, the legacy Enumservice Registrations are

        by <xref target='RFC6117'/>.

        Within and between MMS Environments (MMSE,
        network infrastructures that support the MultiMedia
        Service), other pieces of state data (for example,
        charging-significant information) are exchanged
        between MMS Relay Servers.  Thus, although these
        servers use SMTP as the "bearer" for their
        application exchanges, they map their internal state
        to specialized header fields carried in the SMTP message
        exchanges.  The header fields used in such MMSE are
        described in detail in [17].

        The MMS Architecture describes an interface
        between the MMSE and "legacy messaging systems"
        (labelled as MM3) that accepts "standard" SMTP
        messages.  Thus, although the MMS Relay Server that
        supports this interface appears as a standard SMTP
        server from the perspective of an Internet-based
        mail server, it acts as a gateway and translator,
        adding the internal state data that is used within
        and between the MMS Environments.  This mechanism is
        described in [17], which also includes references to
        the specifications agreed by those bodies
        responsible for the design of the MMS.

        Note that MMS can be used as an alternative to
        deliver an SMS RP-DATA RPDU if, for example, the
        SMS bearer is not supported.  If an entry includes
        this Enumservice, then in effect this can be taken
        as implying that the recipient is capable of
        receiving EMS or SMS messages at this address.  Such
        choices on the end system design do have two small
        caveats; whilst in practice all terminals supporting
        MMS today support SMS as well, it might not
        necessarily be the case in the future, and there may
        be tariff differences in using the MMS rather than
        using the SMS or EMS.

        The kind of communication indicated by this

        A client may imply that the person controlling

      <paragraph>
        This Enumservice indicates that the person
        responsible for the NAPTR is accessible via the PSTN
        (Public Switched Telephone Network) or PLMN (Public
        Land Mobile Network) using the value of the
        generated URI.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>The kind of subsystem required to initiate a
        Voice Enumservice with this Subtype is a "Dialler".
        This is a subsystem that either provides a local
        connection to the PSTN or PLMN, or that provides an
        indirect connection to those networks.  The
        subsystem will use the telephone number held in the
        generated URI to place a voice call.  The voice call
        is placed to a network that uses E.164 numbers to
        route calls to an appropriate destination.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        Note that the PSTN/PLMN connection may be
        indirect.  The end user receiving this NAPTR may
        have a relationship with a Communications Service
        Provider that accepts call initiation requests from
        that subsystem using an IP-based protocol such as
        SIP or H.323, and places the call to the PSTN using
        a remote gateway service.  In this case, the Provider
        may either accept requests using "tel:" URIs or has
        a defined mechanism to convert "tel:" URI values
        into a "protocol-native" form.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        The "tel:" URI value SHOULD be fully qualified
        (using the "global phone number" form of RFC 3966
        [10]).  A "local phone number" as defined in that
        document SHOULD NOT be used unless the controller of
        the zone in which the NAPTR appears is sure that it
        can be distinguished unambiguously by all clients
        that can access the resource record and that a call
        from their network access points can be routed to
        that destination.

        Malicious Redirection:
        One of the fundamental dangers related to any
        service such as this is that a malicious entry in a
        resolver's database will cause clients to resolve
        the E.164 into the wrong LDAP URI.  The possible
        intent may be to cause the client to connect to a
        rogue LDAP server and retrieve (or fail to retrieve)
        a resource containing fraudulent or damaging
        information.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        Denial of Service:
        By removing the URI to which the E.164 maps, a
        malicious intruder may remove the client's ability
        to access the LDAP directory server.

Enumservice Name: "sms"
   Enumservice Type: "sms"
   Enumservice Subtypes: "tel"
   URI Scheme: 'tel:'
   Functional Specification:
      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the
      associated URI scheme is capable of receiving a message using 
      the Short Message Service (SMS) [14] in [RFC4355].
   Security Considerations:
      There are no specific security issues with this Enumservice.
      However, the general considerations of Section 6 apply.
   Intended Usage: COMMON
   Authors:
      Rudolf Brandner, Lawrence Conroy, Richard Stastny (for author
      contact detail see [RFC4355])
   Any other information the author deems interesting:

Enumservice Name: "sms"
   Enumservice Type: "sms"
   Enumservice Subtypes: "mailto"
   URI Scheme: 'mailto:'
   Functional Specification:
      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the
      associated URI scheme is capable of receiving a message using 
      an email protocol.
      SMS content is sent over SMTP using the format specified by TS
      23.140 [15] section 8.4.4 and TS 26.140 [16] section 4 (for
      references see [RFC4355]), as an MMS message.  Within such a
      message, SMS content is carried as either a text or
      application/octet-stream MIME sub-part (see TS 26.140 [16] ,
      section 4.1)
      For references see [RFC4355].
   Security Considerations:
      There are no specific security issues with this Enumservice.
      However, the general considerations of Section 6 apply, see
      [RFC4355].
   Intended Usage: COMMON
   Authors:
      Rudolf Brandner, Lawrence Conroy, Richard Stastny (for author
      contact detail see [RFC4355])
   Any other information the author deems interesting:
      None

Enumservice Name: "ems"
   Enumservice Type: "ems"
   Enumservice Subtype: "tel"
   URI Scheme: 'tel:'
   Functional Specification:
      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the
      associated URI scheme is capable of receiving a message using 
      the Enhanced Message Service (EMS) [14] (For reference see 
      [RFC4355]).
   Security Considerations:
      There are no specific security issues with this Enumservice.
      However, the general considerations of Section 6 apply.
      See [RFC4355]
   Intended Usage: COMMON
   Authors:
      Rudolf Brandner, Lawrence Conroy, Richard Stastny (for author
      contact detail see [RFC4355])
   Any other information the author deems interesting:
      Note that an indication of EMS can be taken as implying that 
      the recipient is capable of receiving SMS messages at this 
      address as well.

Enumservice Name: "ems"
   Enumservice Type: "ems"
   Enumservice Subtypes: "mailto"
   URI Scheme: 'mailto:'
   Functional Specification:
      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the
      associated URI scheme is capable of receiving a message using 
      an email protocol.
      EMS content is sent over SMTP using the format specified by TS
      23.140 [15] section 8.4.4 and TS 26.140 [16] section 4, as an 
      MMS message.  Within such a message, EMS content is carried as 
      either a text or application/octet-stream MIME sub-part (see 
      TS 26.140 [16] , section 4.1).
      For references see [RFC4355]
   Security Considerations:
      There are no specific security issues with this Enumservice.
      However, the general considerations of Section 6 of [RFC4355]
      apply.
   Intended Usage: COMMON
   Authors:

      contact detail see [RFC4355])
   Any other information the author deems interesting:
      None

Enumservice Name: "mms"
   Enumservice Type: "mms"
   Enumservice Subtype: "tel"
   URI Scheme: 'tel:'
   Functional Specification:
      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the
      associated URI scheme is capable of receiving a message using 
      the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) [15]. 
      For references see [RFC4355]
   Security Considerations:
      There are no specific security issues with this Enumservice.
      However, the general considerations of Section 6 of [RFC4355]
      apply.
   Intended Usage: COMMON
   Authors:
      Rudolf Brandner, Lawrence Conroy, Richard Stastny (for author
      contact detail see [RFC4355])
   Any other information the author deems interesting:
      Note that MMS can be used as an alternative to deliver an SMS
      RP-DATA RPDU if, for example, the SMS bearer is not supported.
      If an entry includes this Enumservice, then in effect this can
      be taken as implying that the recipient is capable of receiving
      EMS or SMS messages at this address.  Such choices on the end
      system design do have two small caveats; whilst in practice all
      terminals supporting MMS today support SMS as well, it might
      not necessarily be the case in the future, and there may be 
      tariff differences in using the MMS rather than using the SMS 
      or EMS.

Enumservice Name: "mms"
   Enumservice Type: "mms"
   Enumservice Subtypes: "mailto"
   URI Scheme: 'mailto:'
   Functional Specification:
      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the
      associated URI scheme is capable of receiving a message using 
      an email protocol.
      MMS messages are sent over SMTP using the format specified by 
      TS 23.140 [15] section 8.4.4 and TS 26.140 [16] section 4.
      Within and between MMS Environments (MMSE, network
      infrastructures that support the MultiMedia Service), other
      pieces of state data (for example, charging-significant
      information) are exchanged between MMS Relay Servers.  Thus,
      although these servers use SMTP as the "bearer" for their
      application exchanges, they map their internal state to
      specialised headers carried in the SMTP message exchanges.  
      The headers used in such MMSE are described in detail in [17].
      For references see [RFC4355]
   Security Considerations:
      There are no specific security issues with this Enumservice.
      However, the general considerations of Section 6 of [RFC4355]
      apply.
   Intended Usage: COMMON
   Authors:
      Rudolf Brandner, Lawrence Conroy, Richard Stastny (for author
      contact detail see [RFC4355])
   Any other information the author deems interesting:
      The MMS Architecture describes an interface between the MMSE and
      "legacy messaging systems" (labelled as MM3) which accepts
      "standard" SMTP messages.  Thus although the MMS Relay Server
      that supports this interface appears as a standard SMTP server
      from the perspective of an Internet-based mail server, it acts
      as a gateway and translator, adding the internal state data that
      is used within and between the MMS Environments.  This mechanism
      is described in [17], which also includes references to the
      specifications agreed by those bodies responsible for the design
      of the MMS.

Service Name: E.164 to VPIM MailTo: URL 
   URI Type: "Mailto:" 
   Type: VPIM 
   Subtype: MAILTO 
   Functional Specification: See section 4.2 through 4.4 of [RFC4238]
   Intended Usage: COMMON 
   Author: Greg Vaudreuil (gregv&ieee.org) 
   Error Conditions: 
      o E.164 number not in the numbering plan 
      o E.164 number in the numbering plan, but no URLs exist for that
        number 
      o E2U+VPIM:Mailto Service unavailable 
   Security Considerations: 
      o Malicious Redirection 
        One of the fundamental dangers related to any service such as 
        this is that a malicious entry in a resolver's database will 
        cause clients to resolve the E.164 into the wrong email URL. 
        The possible intent may be to cause the client to send the 
        information to an incorrect destination. 
      o Denial of Service 
        By removing the URL to which the E.164 maps, a malicious 
        intruder may remove the client's ability to access the 
        resource. 
      o Unsolicited Bulk Email 
        The exposure of email addresses through the ENUM 
        service provides a bulk mailer access to large numbers 
        of email addresses where only the telephone number was 
        previously known.   

Service Name: E.164 to VPIM LDAP URL 
   URI Type: "LDAP:" 
   Type: VPIM 
   Subtype: LDAP 
   Functional Specification: See section 3.2 through 3.3 of [RFC4238]
   Intended Usage: COMMON 
   Author: Greg Vaudreuil (gregv&ieee.org) 
   Security Considerations: 
      o Malicious Redirection 
        One of the fundamental dangers related to any service 
        such as this is that a malicious entry in a resolver's 
        database will cause clients to resolve the E.164 into 
        the wrong LDAP URL.  The possible intent may be to cause 
        the client to connect to a rogue LDAP server and 
        retrieve (or fail to retrieve) a resource containing 
        fraudulent or damaging information. 
      o Denial of Service 
        By removing the URL to which the E.164 maps, a 
        malicious intruder may remove the client's ability to 
        access the LDAP directory server. 

Enumservice Name: "voice"
   Enumservice Type: "voice"
   Enumservice Subtype: "tel"
   URI Scheme: 'tel:'
   Functional Specification:
      The kind of communication indicated by this Enumservice is
      "Interactive Voice".  From a protocol perspective, this
      communication is expected to involve bidirectional media streams
      carrying audio data.
      A client may imply that the person controlling population of a
      NAPTR holding this Enumservice indicates their capability to
      engage in an interactive voice session when contacted using the
      URI generated by this NAPTR.
   Security Considerations:
      See Section 5 of [RFC4415]
   Intended Usage: COMMON
   Authors:  Rudolf Brandner, Lawrence Conroy, Richard Stastny (for 
             author contact detail see Authors' Addresses section)
   Any other information the author deems interesting:
    o This Enumservice indicates that the person responsible for the
      NAPTR is accessible via the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone
      Network) or PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) using the value of
      the generated URI.
    o The kind of subsystem required to initiate a Voice Enumservice
      with this sub-type is a "Dialler".  This is a subsystem that
      either provides a local connection to the PSTN or PLMN, or that
      provides an indirect connection to those networks.  The
      subsystem will use the telephone number held in the generated
      URI to place a voice call.  The voice call is placed to a
      network that uses E.164 numbers to route calls to an appropriate
      destination.
    o Note that the PSTN/PLMN connection may be indirect.  The end
      user receiving this NAPTR may have a relationship with a
      Communications Service Provider that accepts call initiation
      requests from that subsystem using an IP-based protocol such as
      SIP or H.323, and places the call to the PSTN using a remote
      gateway service.  In this case the Provider may either accept
      requests using "tel:" URIs or has a defined mechanism to convert
      "tel:" URI values into a "protocol-native" form.
    o The "tel:" URI value SHOULD be fully qualified (using the
      "global phone number" form of RFC3966 [10]).  A "local phone
      number" as defined in that document SHOULD NOT be used unless
      the controller of the zone in which the NAPTR appears is sure
      that it can be distinguished unambiguously by all clients that
      can access the resource record and that a call from their
      network access points can be routed to that destination.

   URI Schemes: "http", "https"
   Functional Specification:
      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified is a
      plain vCard, according to RFC 2426, which may be accessed using
      HTTP/ HTTPS [7].
      Clients fetching the vCard from the resource indicated should
      expect access to be restricted.  Additionally, the comprehension
      of the data provided may vary depending on the client's 
      identity.

      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified 
      is an 'im:' URI.  The 'im:' URI scheme does not identify 
      any particular protocol that will be used to handle 
      instant messaging receipt or delivery, rather the mechanism 
      in RFC 3861 [4] is used to discover whether an IM protocol 
      supported by the party querying ENUM is also supported by 
      the target resource.
