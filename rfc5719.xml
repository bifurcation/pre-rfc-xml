	<abstract>
  <t> The Diameter base specification, described in RFC 3588, provides a number of ways to
	extend Diameter, with new Diameter commands (i.e., messages used by Diameter
	applications) and applications as the most extensive enhancements. RFC 3588
	illustrates the conditions that lead to the need to define a new Diameter
	application or a new command code. Depending on the scope of the Diameter extension,
	IETF actions are necessary. Although defining new Diameter applications does not
	require IETF consensus, defining new Diameter commands requires IETF consensus per
	RFC 3588. This has led to questionable design decisions by other Standards
	Development Organizations, which chose to define new applications on existing
	commands -- rather than asking for assignment of new command
	codes -- for the pure purpose of avoiding bringing their specifications to the IETF. In some cases,
	interoperability problems were an effect of the poor design caused by
	overloading existing commands. </t>
  <t> This document aligns the extensibility rules of the Diameter application with the
	Diameter commands, offering ways to delegate work on Diameter to other SDOs to extend
	Diameter in a way that does not lead to poor design choices. </t>

		<section title="Introduction">
<t> The Diameter Base specification, described in <xref target="RFC3588"/>,
	provides a number of ways to extend Diameter, with new Diameter commands (i.e.,
	messages used by Diameter applications) and applications as the most extensive
	enhancements. <xref target="RFC3588" /> illustrates the
	conditions that require the definition of a
	new Diameter application or a new command. Depending on the scope of the Diameter
	extension, IETF actions are necessary. Although defining new Diameter applications
	does not require IETF consensus, defining new Diameter commands requires IETF
	consensus per RFC 3588. This has led to questionable design decisions by other
	Standards Development Organizations (SDOs), which chose to define new applications on
	existing commands -- rather than asking for assignment of new
	command codes -- for the pure purpose of avoiding bringing
	their specifications to the IETF. In some cases,
	interoperability problems were an effect of poor the design caused
	by overloading existing commands. </t>
<t>This document aligns the extensibility rules for Diameter command codes with those
	defined for Diameter application identifiers and offers a consistent way to delegate
	work on Diameter to other SDOs to extend Diameter in a way that does not lead to
	poor design choices. </t>
<t> This is achieved by splitting the command code space into ranges and providing different
	allocation policies to them: the first range is reserved for RADIUS backward
	compatibility, allocation of a command code in the second number range requires IETF
	review, the third range is utilized by vendor-specific command codes, and finally
	the last range is for experimental commands. <xref target="iana"/> provides more
	details about the command code number ranges, and the different allocation policies are
	described in <xref target="RFC5226"/>. </t>
<t> A revision of RFC 3588 is currently in development in the IETF DIME WG <xref
		target="RFC3588bis"/>; when approved, it will obsolete RFC 3588 as
	well as this document. A goal of this document is to provide in advance the change
	in the command codes allocation policy, so that interoperability
		problems like the ones described above are avoided as soon as possible. </t>

		<section title="Security Considerations">
<t> This document modifies the IANA allocation of Diameter command codes in relationship
	to RFC 3588. This process change itself does not raise security concerns, but the
	command code space is split into a standard command code space and a vendor-specific
	command code space, the latter being allocated on a First Come, First Served basis
	by IANA at the request of vendors or other standards
	organizations. 

        Whenever work gets delegated to organizations outside the IETF, there is always the chance that
security reviews will be conducted in different manner and that the
criteria and style of those reviews will be different than the
reviews performed in the IETF.  The members of the DIME working group are aware of the
risks involved in using different security and quality review
processes and of the desire to offload work (e.g., to reduce the
workload in the IETF) to other organizations.
Other organizations are therefore made
responsible for the quality of the specifications they produce.

		<section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">

<t> This section describes changes to the IANA Considerations sections outlined in RFC
	3588 regarding the allocation of command codes by IANA. </t>

<t> The command code namespace is used to identify Diameter
	commands. The values 0 - 255
	(0x00 - 0xff) are reserved for RADIUS backward compatibility and are defined as
	"RADIUS Packet Type Codes" in <xref target="RADTYPE"/>. Values
	256 - 8,388,607
	(0x100 - 0x7fffff) are for permanent, standard commands allocated by IETF Review
		<xref target="RFC5226"/>. <xref target="RFC3588"/>
	defines the command codes 257, 258, 271, 274, 275, 280, and
	282; see Section 3.1 in <xref target="RFC3588"/> for the assignment of the
namespace in that specification.</t>

<t> The values 8,388,608 - 16,777,213 (0x800000 - 0xfffffd) are reserved for
	vendor-specific command codes, to be allocated on a First Come, First Served basis
	by IANA <xref target="RFC5226"/>. The request to IANA for a vendor-specific command
	code SHOULD include a reference to a publicly available specification that
	documents the command in sufficient detail to aid in interoperability between
	independent implementations. If the specification cannot be made publicly available,
	the request for a vendor-specific command code MUST include the contact information
	of persons and/or entities responsible for authoring and maintaining the command. </t>
<t> The values 16,777,214 and 16,777,215 (hexadecimal values 0xfffffe - 0xffffff) are
	reserved for experimental commands. As these codes are only for experimental and
	testing purposes, no guarantee is made for interoperability between Diameter peers
	using experimental commands, as outlined in <xref target="RFC3692"/>. </t>
		</section>

		<section title="Acknowledgements">
<t>The content of this document is the result of the work in the IETF Diameter
	Maintenance and Extensions (DIME) working group. We would therefore like to thank
	all the working group members who were involved in that discussion. While it appears
	to be a fairly small change in the allocation policy, the effect on implementations
	is rather dramatic.</t>
<t>We would like to thank Mark Jones for his review comments.</t>
