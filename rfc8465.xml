		<section title="Background">

			<t>
				Mobile communication has been rapidly
				improved from low-bit-rate circuit-switched systems to the higher-data-rate packet-switched system. The
				packet-switched system has added
				the mobile capability of Internet Protocol
				(IP) connectivity; thereby, the IP
				Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) have made
				SIP-based calls and IP multimedia
				sessions from mobile devices possible.
			</t>

			<t>
				3GPP2 defines High Rate Packet Data (HRPD) with high data rates, and it dispenses with the 
				1x Circuit Switched (1xCS) infrastructure.
				This means that with HRPD networks, voice calls will need to be conducted using IP and IMS. 
			 However, SIP-based IMS networks will take a great many years from the
   time of writing to transition to the use of all IP; mobile devices will
   need to operate in both IP/SIP/IMS mode and circuit-switched mode.	


				This 
				means that calls and sessions
				will need to be handed over between IP/SIP/IMS mode and circuit-switched mode 
				mid-call or mid-session. 
				To achieve this, the mobile
				device needs to simultaneously communicate via both the IP/SIP/IMS domain and 
				the circuit-switched domain.
			</t>

			<t>
				To meet this need, 3GPP2 has specified how to maintain voice-session continuity 
				between the IP/SIP/IMS domain and the 
				circuit-switched domain in 3GPP2 S.X0042-A <xref target="refs.S.X0042-A"/>.
			</t>



			<t> 
				In order for the mobile device to access SIP/IMS voice service via
  the circuit-switched domain, 3GPP2 has specified that a Mobile Switching
  Center (MSC) server will control mobile
  voice call setup over the circuit-switched radio access while
  establishing the corresponding voice session in the core network
  using SIP/IMS. The specified MSC server operates either via an IMS Media Gateway Control Function
  (MGCF) or directly if it is enhanced by SIP interface. To enable
				this, the mobile device MUST be
				identified in both the 1xCS and IP/SIP/IMS
				domains. The only mobile device
				identifier that is transportable using
				1xCS signaling is the MEID; therefore,
				the Instance ID included by the MGCF
				or the MSC server and the Instance ID
				directly included by the mobile device
				both need to be based on the MEID.
			</t>

			<t>
				Additionally in order to meet the
				above requirements, the same MEID that
				is obtained from the circuit-switched
				signaling by the MSC server needs to
				be obtainable from SIP signaling so
				that it can be determined that both
				the SIP signaling and circuit-switched
				signaling originate from the same
				mobile device.
			</t>
				


		</section>
		

		<section title="3GPP2 Use Cases">

			<t><list style="numbers">
				<t>The mobile device includes its MEID
				in the SIP REGISTER request so that
				the SIP registrar can perform a check
				of the Equipment Identity Register
				(EIR) to verify if this mobile device
				is allowed or barred from accessing
				the network for non-emergency services
				(e.g., because it has been stolen). If
				the mobile device is not allowed to
				access the network for non-emergency
				services, the SIP registrar can reject
				the registration. Thus, a barred mobile
				device is prevented from accessing the
				network for non-emergency services.
			</t>


			<t>
				The mobile device includes its MEID
				in SIP INVITE requests used to
				establish emergency sessions.  This is
				so that the Public Safety Answering
				Point (PSAP) can obtain the MEID of
				the mobile device for identification
				purposes if required by regulations.
			</t>

			
			<t>
				The inclusion by the mobile device
				of its MEID in SIP INVITE requests
				used to establish emergency sessions
				is also used in the cases of
				unauthenticated emergency sessions to
				enable the network to identify the
				mobile device.  This is especially
				important if the unauthenticated
				emergency session is handed over from
				the packet-switched domain to the
				circuit-switched domain. In this
				scenario, the MEID is the only
				identifier that is common to both
				domains. The Emergency Access Transfer
				Function (EATF), which coordinates the
				call transfer between the domains, can
				thus use the MEID to identify that the
				circuit-switched call is from the same
				mobile device that was in the
				emergency session in the packet-switched domain.

		<section anchor="UAC" title="User Agent Client Procedures">

		  <t>
		    
				A single mode 3GPP2 User Agent Client
				(UAC), which uses only 3GPP2 technology
				to transmit and receive voice or data,
				has an MEID as specified in 3GPP2
				S.R0048-A <xref
				target="refs.S.R0048-A"/>. The single
				mode 3GPP2 UAC that is registering
				with a 3GPP2 IMS network includes in
				the "sip.instance" media feature tag
				the 3GPP2 MEID URN according to the
				syntax specified in
				RFC 8464 <xref
				target="RFC8464"/>
				when performing the registration
				procedures specified in RFC 5626 <xref
				target="RFC5626"/> or RFC 5627 <xref
				target="RFC5627"/> (or any other
				procedure requiring the inclusion of
				the "sip.instance" media feature tag).
			</t>
			
			<t>
				A UAC MUST NOT use the 3GPP2 MEID URN
				as an Instance ID except when
				registering with a 3GPP2 IMS
				network. When a UAC is operating in
				IMS mode, it will obtain the domain of
				the carrier's IMS network to register
				with, from the Universal Integrated
				Circuit Card (UICC),
				preconfiguration, or the network at
				the time of establishing the Packet
				Data Protocol (PDP) context. These
				three methods are carrier specific and
				are only performed by the carrier IMS
				networks.  The UAC will also obtain
				the address of the IMS edge proxy to
				send the REGISTER request containing
				the MEID using information elements in
				the Attach response when it attempts
				to connect to the carrier's packet data
				network. When registering with a
				non-3GPP or non-3GPP2 IMS network, a
				UAC SHOULD use a UUID
				as an Instance ID as
				specified in RFC 5626 <xref
				target="RFC5626"/>.
			</t>
       

			<t>
				A UAC MUST NOT include the
				"sip.instance" media feature tag
				containing the 3GPP2 MEID URN in the
				Contact header field of non-REGISTER
				requests except when the request is
				related to an emergency
				session.


				Regulations can require that the MEID be provided to the PSAP. Any future exceptions to this
				prohibition require an RFC that
				addresses how privacy is not violated
				by such usage.

			       Since MEIDs, like other formats of
			       Instance IDs, can be correlated to a
			       user, they are personally identifiable
			       information and MUST be treated as
			       such. In particular, the "sip.instance"
			       media feature tag containing the 3GPP2
			       MEID URN MUST NOT be included in
			       requests or responses intended to
			       convey any level of anonymity, as this
			       could violate the user's privacy. RFC

			       requires that the UA not reveal its

			   <!--End DNE text -->
			   The same concerns apply when
			       using the 3GPP2 MEID URN as an
			       Instance ID. Publication of the 3GPP2
			       MEID URN to networks that the UA is not
			       attached to or the UA does not have a

			       breach; the "sip.instance" media
			       feature tag MUST NOT be forwarded by
			       the service provider's network elements
			       when forwarding requests or responses
			       towards the destination UA. The 3GPP2
			       MEID URN MUST NOT accidentally leak in

			       subscribe to user registration state
			       using the event package defined in RFC
			       3680 <xref

			       Instance ID containing the 3GPP2 MEID
			       URN identifies a mobile device and not
			       a user. The Instance ID containing the
			       3GPP2 MEID URN MUST NOT be used alone
			       as an address for a user or as an
			       identification credential for a
			       user. The GRUU mechanism specified in
			       RFC 5627 <xref target="RFC5627"/>
			       provides a means to create URIs that

			       or UA.
		       </t> 
		       
		       <t>
			       Entities that log the Instance ID need

		       </t>

		       <t>
			       In order to protect the "sip.instance"
			       media feature tag containing the 3GPP2
			       MEID URN from being tampered with,
			       those REGISTER requests containing the

			       Layer Security (TLS) as specified in
			       RFC 8446 <xref target="RFC8446"/> or
			       any other security mechanism that
