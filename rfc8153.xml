<t>The RFC Editor is both the publisher and the archivist for the RFC Series.
This document applies specifically to the archivist role of the RFC Editor.
It provides guidance on when and how to preserve RFCs and describes the tools required
to view or re-create RFCs as necessary.  This document also highlights 
gaps in the current process and suggests compromises to balance cost with
best practice.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>The RFC Editor is both the publisher and the archivist for the RFC Series, a
series of technical specifications and policy documents that includes
foundational Internet standards <xref target="RFC6635"/> <xref
target="RFC-SERIES"/>.  
The goal of the RFC Editor is to is to produce clear,
consistent, and readable documents for the Internet community. Over
time, the RFC Editor will use as
many modern features, such as hyperlinks and content markup, within the
document as necessary to convey the information the authors intended
for their audience.
As the archivist, however, the main goal is to preserve both the information
described and the documents themselves for the indefinite future.  To meet both
of these goals, the RFC Editor must find the necessary balance between the
publication needs of today and the archival needs of tomorrow, while
acknowledging a finite set of resources to complete both aspects of the RFC
Editor function.  </t>


<t>While many files are created during the editing process, this
document focuses on the archival needs of the Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) that
were approved for publication and the RFCs 
that resulted from these I-Ds; I-Ds before they are approved for publication by the
appropriate stream-approving body are out of scope.</t>

<t>To summarize, the key areas of tension between the roles of publisher and archivist are:</t>

<t><list style='symbols'>
  <t>the desire of the publisher to meet the needs expressed by authors
  who want to use the latest technology (e.g., vector
  graphics, live links, and a rich set of metadata) within their documents; and</t>

  <t>the desire of the archivist to support only the simplest format for
  documents possible -- currently held by the Series to be plain-text, ASCII-only
  documents -- so that the tools needed to view the documents are equally
  simple and resistant to changes in technology, resulting in a set of
  documents that will be easier to archive for at least the next several
  decades, if not centuries.</t>

</list></t>

<t>Through most of the history of the RFC Series, the file format for RFCs has
been plain text with an ASCII-only character set.  This choice offered the
simplest format likely to remain available to the largest number of consumers
and the format most likely to be resistant to changes in technology over time.
Increasingly, however, consumers and authors are requesting additional
features that would allow for easy reading on a wider array of devices while
retaining all the metadata authors intended in their documents.  In 2013, RFC
6949 ("RFC Series Format Requirements and Future Development") captured the
high-level requirements for the Series; the fundamental issue was that 
plain-text, ASCII-only documents no longer meet the needs of the communities
interested in using and producing RFCs <xref target="RFC6949"/>.</t>


<t>The assertion that plain-text, ASCII-only documents no longer meet the
needs of the community suggests that the simple archival process
maintained by the RFC Editor is also no longer sufficient.  More complex tools
and file formats require a more complex process to ensure that RFCs can
be read and rendered far into the future.  This document describes the
considerations that must inform any changes in policy and procedure, and it
describes a model for the RFC Series to follow when additional formats beyond
plain-text, ASCII-only RFCs are published.  The functional model that
provides the framework for the archival process described in this document was
derived from the ISO Open Archival Information System (OAIS) reference model,
defined in "Space data and information transfer systems -- Open archival
information system (OAIS) -- Reference model" <xref target="ISO14721"/>.</t>


<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

<t>Acquisition: The point at which a document is accepted by the RFC Editor for future inclusion into the archive. </t>

<t>Ingestion: The point at which a digital object is assigned all necessary
metadata to describe the object and its contents and is added to the
archive.</t>

<t>Bitstream preservation: The process of storing and maintaining digital
objects over time, ensuring that there is no loss or corruption of the bits
making up those objects. </t>


<t>Content preservation: The retention of the ability to read, listen, or
watch a digital file in perpetuity. Content preservation is not about the bits
being stored; it is about being able to access and present those bits to the
user.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="life-cycle-of-digital-preservation" title="Life Cycle of Digital Preservation">

<t>The basic process for preserving digital information has been described by
a variety of organizations.  From the Life cycle Information For E-Literature
(LIFE) project <xref target="LIFE"/> in the United Kingdom to the ongoing digital preservation work
in the U.S.&nbsp;Library of Congress <xref target="USLOC"/>, the basic digital
preservation process is straightforward.  Documents are
acquired and processed, metadata is recorded, physical media is refreshed, and
content is regularly checked to see if it is still accessible by interested
parties.  Complexities arise when one considers the need to preserve both
the bits of the digital objects themselves and the tools with which to express
those bits in an environment that experiences rapid changes in technology.</t>


<t>For most of the existence of the RFC Series, the digital preservation
process has been fairly simple, focusing on bitstream preservation and
relying on paper copies of digital files. </t>


<t>The current archival process for the RFC Series is as follows:</t>

<t><list style='numbers'>
  <t>Acquisition:  The RFC Editor database is updated to indicate an
  I-D has been approved for publication.  At this point, the
  document is taken through the editorial process on the way to publication
  <xref target="RFC-PUB"/>.</t>

  <t>Ingestion: The RFC is added to the archive at the time of
  publication.</t>

  <t>Metadata creation: The details regarding an RFC, including RFC number,
  author, title, abstract, etc., are created at time of publication.
  Additional metadata in the form of status and errata can be added or changed
  at any time, following the process of the originating document stream.</t>

  <t>Bitstream preservation: This part of the process is handled as part of
  the IT system administration; all servers, disks, and backup technology are
  refreshed on a regular cycle.</t>

  <t>Content preservation:  All RFCs since January 2010 have been printed out on
  standard office paper at time of publication, and the electronic files
  have been preserved on disk and in backups with no particular focus on preserving the
  entire computing environment used to create the electronic documents.  Most
  RFCs prior to January 2010 are also available on paper, but there are gaps
  in the record and issues of ownership around the paper copies before that
  date.</t>

</list></t>

<t>When the format for RFCs transitions from plain-text, ASCII-only files to
an XML format with multiple outputs, the overall archival process will become
more complex.  Additional metadata and some (or possibly all) of the computing
environment may need to be added to the archive.</t>


</section>
</section>
<section anchor="updating-policy-and-procedure" title="Updating Policy and Procedure">

<t>RFCs are created and published as digital objects.  Unlike paper-based
publications, a digital collection requires a focus on retaining the details
of the technology as well as retaining the object itself.  


Specifically, a digital archive needs to: </t>

<t><list style='symbols'>
  <t>consider the inherent instability of digital media,</t>
  <t>plan for a relatively short path to technological obsolescence,</t>
  <t>schedule regular media updates,</t>
  <t>apply predefined criteria for technology evaluation, and</t>
  <t>ensure the continued authenticity and integrity of documents through any changes in technology.</t>
</list></t>

<t>As the custodian and canonical source of RFCs and associated errata, the
RFC Editor must consider how to ensure the availability and integrity of this
document series far into the future and determine whether the focus must be on
bitstream preservation, content preservation, or both.  </t>


<t>The RFC Editor has several advantages in acting as the digital archivist
for the Series.  Since the RFC Editor is the publisher as well as the
archivist, the RFC Editor controls the format of the material and the process for
adding that material to an archive and can add any additional metadata
considered necessary.  External material, while a major consideration for
more general archives, is no longer accepted by the RFC Editor.  (See
"Internet Archaeology: Documents from Early History" <xref
target="RFC-HISTORY"/> for the list of non-RFC
digital objects held by the RFC Editor.)</t>


<t>This document describes several different preservation models that may fit
the needs of the Series and raises several points for community
consideration.  Specifically, this document covers information on:</t>

<t><list style='symbols'>
  <t>Acquisition of documents</t>
  <t>Ingestion of documents</t>
  <t>Metadata and document registration</t>
  <t>Normalization and standardization of canonical file structure and format</t>
  <t>Transformation/migration to current publication formats</t>
  <t>Content and computing environment preservation</t>
  <t>System parameters</t>
  <t>Financial impact</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="acquisition-of-documents" title="Acquisition of Documents">
<t>The acquisition process for documents intended for the archive starts with
the submission of an approved I-D for publication.  During the editorial
process, information such as the document metadata is finalized prior to
publication.  However, the initial I-D as submitted and the RFC produced from it do not
formally enter the archive until the time of publication, which is
considered the point of ingestion from an archival perspective.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="ingest-of-documents" title="Ingestion of Documents">
<t>Once an RFC is published, the canonical format is considered immutable.  At
this point, the RFC Production Center, one of the internal roles within the
RFC Editor, assigns the document metadata that an archivist needs to identify the
unique object.</t>

<t>In the case of RFCs, the metadata assigned to a document at the time of publication includes:</t>

<t><list style='symbols'>
  <t>the RFC number</t>
  <t>ISSN</t>
  <t>publication date</t>
  <t>Digital Object Identifier (DOI)</t>
</list></t>

<t>Additional metadata, such as author name, is assigned earlier in the
document creation process, but it is subject to change up to the point of
publication.  More information on metadata is available in <xref
target="metadata-and-document-registration"/> ("Metadata
and Document Registration").</t>

<t>In terms of deciding what to accept in the archive -- a major question for
most archives and yet a simple one for the RFC Series -- the RFC Editor accepts
documents that are approved for publication by the approving body of
one of the document streams: the IETF, IAB, IRTF, or Independent Submission
streams <xref target="RFC7841"/>.   Each document stream has defined processes
on when and how I-Ds are approved and submitted to the RFC Editor for
publication.  
The RFC Editor does not select
documents for publication and archiving; the RFC Editor edits and
publishes documents approved for publication by the document streams.
</t>


<t>The RFC Editor holds no copyright on I-Ds or RFCs.  As per the IETF Trust
Legal Provisions <xref target="TLP"/>, the copyright for RFCs is held by the
authors and the IETF
Trust.  At any point in time, the current entities
providing RFC Editor services must be able to release the archive of RFCs to
the IETF Trust. </t>


<t>Note: The RFC Editor is currently only responsible for RFCs; any associated
datasets or other research data is not considered within the RFC Editor's
mandate at this time; therefore, no consideration to the archival
requirements of such datasets is covered in this document.  </t>


</section>
<section anchor="metadata-and-document-registration" title="Metadata and Document Registration">

<t>Metadata is data about data.  In the field of digital archiving, this is
the data that clearly identifies every aspect of a document, from its
identifier (i.e., the RFC number and the I-D draft string) to the size and
file format of the document and more.  Metadata is stored in a central
registry that records information on exactly what is being preserved and where it
is located, information on authenticity and provenance, and details on the
hardware and/or software needed to view or create the documents. </t>


<t>The RFC Editor maintains this registry in the form of a database
that includes all metadata available for documents being edited and 
for published RFCs.
This database feeds the search engine on the RFC Editor
website and the info pages available for every RFC (e.g.,
http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc####).</t>

<t>Following is the current list of metadata presented in the RFC info pages:</t>

<t><list style='symbols'>
  <t>RFC number</t>
  <t>Canonical URI</t>
  <t>Title</t>
  <t>Status</t>
  <t>Updates (if applicable)</t>
  <t>Updated by (if applicable)</t>
  <t>Obsoletes (if applicable)</t>
  <t>Obsoleted by (if applicable)</t>
  <t>Authors</t>
  <t>Stream</t>
  <t>Abstract</t>
  <t>Content-Type</t>
  <t>Character Set</t>
  <t>ISSN</t>
  <t>Publication date</t>
  <t>Digital Object Identifier (DOI)</t>
</list></t>

<t>The following metadata will be added in the future:</t>

<t><list style='symbols'>
  <t>Publication format URIs</t>
</list></t>

<t>Info pages also include links to errata, IPR searches, and both plain-text and XML citation files.</t>

<t>In terms of best practice, all documents used as normative references
within an RFC would also be stored in the archive.  While this is done
automatically when the normative reference is another RFC (the usual case),
retaining a copy of third-party documents is considered out of scope for the
RFC Editor.  As the digital archive industry stabilizes, services such as
Perma.cc <xref target="PERMACC"/> may be a reasonable compromise.  These
services provide a permanent URI and image capture of online documents, with a
goal of buffering against URI and online availability changes.</t>

</section>
<section
    anchor="normalization-and-standardization-of-canonical-file-structure-and-format"
    title="Normalization and Standardization of Canonical File Structure and Format">

<t>The normalization process is perhaps the most technically critical part of
digital archiving.  The purpose is content preservation -- making sure the
data accepted for archiving are in the most stable and easily accessed formats
possible for the long-term future and require the least amount of
re-engineering and emulation of environments in order to view the document in
the future.  Normalization is about enabling long-term access to the
information within a document.</t>


<t>Over the history of the RFC Series, documents have been submitted for
publication in a variety of formats, including paper for the earliest RFCs.
Today, the majority of RFCs are available in both a canonical plain-text
format and PDF format.  For exceptions, see the RFC Online
Project  <xref target="RFC-ONLINE"/>.  </t>


<t>Currently, all RFCs are printed out to paper and stored at time of
publication.  This has been a reasonable backup plan for several decades.
With few of the features one might expect from a digital document format
(such as links, metadata within the document, and line drawings), plain-text
files do not lose much, if any, information when printed out to paper.
However, as the
published formats change (see RFC 6949), printing to paper provides
less value as much of the metadata that is an intrinsic yet invisible part of
the rendered document will be lost in such printing.  With that in mind, the
focus needs to change to preserving the new file formats electronically.</t>

<t>While each RFC today is printed to paper and all electronic versions stored
on multiple hard drives, no particular effort is made to ensure copies of the
software used to render or read the canonical plain-text RFC are also
archived.  The RFC Editor has several choices on how to adapt to the need to
archive a more complex set of data and follow best practice as defined by the
digital archive community:</t>


<t><list style='symbols'>
  <t>a simplified bitstream preservation model that focuses on standard "best effort"
  data-retention practices, which rely on backups, upgrades, and
  regular equipment change to preserve the data. This model assumes that emulators
  may be built when needed if the formats used go out of common use (a
  significant part of the model currently followed by the RFC Editor).</t>

  <t>a content preservation model that focuses on one publication format as the
  version most likely to be viewable and provide all necessary metadata in the
  future. This is a viable option considering that PDF/A-3
  <xref target="PDF"/>, one of the intended publication formats, was designed
  for this type of archiving. </t>

  <t>a complex bitstream and content preservation model that focuses on
  archiving the canonical XML and the entire computing environment required to
  create, view and render all outputs from that file. This is the "best practice" 
  from an archivist's perspective.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Those options are listed in order of least to greatest complexity and expense.  More detail on each option is described below.</t>

<section anchor="best-effort-data-retention" title="'Best Effort' Data Retention">

<t>When dealing with very simple data structures such as plain-text,
ASCII-only files, the experience of the RFC Series suggests that for the last
few decades, hardware and operating system changes have had minimal impact on
the document files being stored.  While a complete failure of an operating
system migration corrupted the dataset in the past, that situation
represents a somewhat different problem than the tools themselves changing
such that plain-text files are not easily read with existing technology.
Given that the basic plain-text format and ASCII encoding remain in common
use, the standard protections against file corruption and data loss, such as
disk mirroring, off-site backups, and periodic restoration testing, will
continue to provide access to the entirety of the RFC Series for the
foreseeable future.  As has been pointed out, both in this document and in
broader community discussion, that is not sufficient for
complex formats such as XML, HTML, PDF, or other proprietary formats offered
by today's large IT companies.  The risk of technological change resulting in
the file formats mentioned being deprecated or changed without backwards
compatibility is fairly high when looking decades or
centuries into the future.</t>


<t>It is recommended that this model of archiving the RFC Series cease to be
the primary model after the plain-text, ASCII-only format is no longer the
canonical format.  Best effort data retention is a necessary but not
sufficient level of effort for preserving a digital archive.  
For more guidance on how to define best effort data retention, the section on
"Media and Formats, Summary Recommendations" in the 2009 version of the Digital
Preservation Handbook <xref target="DPC2009"/> provides useful and concrete
information.</t>


</section>
<section anchor="single-format-for-archival-purposes" title="Single Format for Archival Purposes">


<t>If preserving the information described by a
document, rather than the document itself, is the primary purpose of an
archive, then focusing efforts on a single file format is a reasonable option.
Some well-supported archival tooling projects follow this route, such as
Archivematica <xref target="ARCHIVEMATICA"></xref>.
By selecting a feature-rich yet fundamentally stable file format for
documents, an organization may avoid expensive whole-environment
reconstruction in order to view the document.  The PDF/A formats were designed
to be an archival format for electronic documents, and PDF/A-3 is one of the
options intended for publication as the RFC Series moves from a plain-text
canonical format to an XML canonical format with multiple publication formats.
A PDF/A-3 file can be produced that embeds the XML from which the PDF/A-3 file
was created; this allows for both original and rendered document
validation if one has the correct tools available to see the source of the
PDF/A-3 file <xref target="RFC7995"/>.  The XML is not otherwise visible when
viewing the PDF/A-3 file through typical PDF reader software.</t>

<t>When looking at the need to archive RFCs in a resource-limited environment,
a content-preservation-only model has merit, but it is not without risks.
First, PDF/A-3 will not be the canonical format; it is intended to be one of
the rendered outputs.  It may contain rendering bugs that were not intended to
be in the document.  Second, while the various PDF/A formats were designed to
be archival, they have not been put to the test of time to determine if they will
actually live up to the design goals.</t>


<t>This is a valid option to consider, but the risks, priorities, and costs
must be discussed by the community before a decision is made to follow this
path.  The best option may be to combine this with one of the other methods of
archiving described in this document to help minimize both risk and cost.</t>


</section>
<section anchor="holistic-archiving-of-the-computing-environment" title="Holistic Archiving of the Computing Environment">

<t>Preserving everything published by the RFC Editor in order to have a
permanent record of information, standards, and best practice is arguably the
whole point of being an archival series.  One can argue that it is not only
about the information described in an RFC, it is also about supporting
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and retaining the history of the Internet.
In following this model, however, one must consider the complexity of the
archival environment as matching, and possibly exceeding, the complexity of
the file formats being preserved.</t>

<t>Consider a future where XML has been obsoleted for half a century, HTML5
was a format used three to four human generations ago, and PDF/A-3 is no
longer supported by any existing company's reading software.   
For RFCs that were produced with XML as their canonical format, an archive must
not only hold the data, it must also hold the entire computing environment
that allows the data to be rendered and viewed.  Operating systems and
hardware on which those OSs can run, each major version of each piece of
software used or relied upon during the publication of an RFC, browsers and
readers for HTML, PDF, and any other publication format must be preserved in
some fashion.  This is considered best practice when archiving digital
documents.  This is also the most expensive method, and the cost only increases over
time as more and more instances of the computing environment must be preserved
over the lifetime of the Series.</t>


<t>This is a valid option to consider, but the sheer scope of resources
required suggests that this must be discussed by the community before a
decision is made.  Pursuing this may require an entirely different paradigm
for the RFC Editor from what has been considered in the past; expanding the
scope and resources for the RFC Editor, finding a third party to take over the
responsibilities of archiving, or some other option may be necessary.</t>


</section>
</section>
<section anchor="transformationmigration-to-current-publication-formats" title="Transformation/Migration to Current Publication Formats">

<t>Because normalization is a complex subject, it is important to consider
how to mitigate the risk of failure of the normalization process. </t>

<t>The RFC Editor is responsible for making RFCs available to the Internet
community.  The canonical version of an RFC does not change once published;
any formats officially rendered from the canonical version, however, may
change.  One way to mitigate the need to preserve the entire computing
environment for an RFC, including web browsers and PDF readers, would be to
take advantage of the non-canonical nature of the publication formats and
re-render them from the canonical source at the point that browser or reader
technology has changed sufficiently to make RFCs largely unavailable to
'modern' tools.</t>


<t>For example, the RFC Editor may develop the practice of annually
reviewing the tools needed to view the publication formats created by the RFC
Editor to determine whether or not the current common and popular reader
technologies (i.e., web browsers, PDF viewers, e-readers) can view the
existing publication formats.  During that review, the RFC Editor would work
with the community to determine if the current publication formats meet the
needs of the community and whether any should be retired or added to improve
the availability of information to the community at that time.</t>


</section>
<section anchor="system-parameters" title="System Parameters">

<t>While the industry best practice on the backup and restoration of data is
not sufficient as a long-term archival solution, it is still a necessary part
of keeping the Series available now and into the future.  In the past, nearly
800 RFCs had to be manually transcribed from paper back to electronic format
due to a failed server migration and insufficient backups.  </t>


<t>The underlying servers hosting the tools, database, RFCs, and errata are
the physical link in the archival environment.  While such systems cannot and
should not remain static and unchanging, there must be clear documentation
regarding the environment, in particular, the storage, backups, and recovery
processes for all RFC-related material.  The documentation must include
information on the refresh cycle for the physical storage and backup media and
describe a regular cycle of data restoration and/or migration testing.</t>


</section>
<section anchor="financial-planning" title="Financial Impact">

<t>Having a policy regarding digital archiving provides input into the budget process.
The main costs associated with digital archives come from the complexity and
quantity of the material being archived, as described in <xref target="normalization-and-standardization-of-canonical-file-structure-and-format"/> on
normalization. 
</t>

<t>Estimating potential costs and providing figures are outside of the scope of
this document, but it should be noted that costs are a major factor when
determining what level of archival practice an organization will follow.</t>

<t>For more information on potential business plans and cost modeling for
digital preservation, see the "Business cases, benefits,
costs, and impact" section of the Digital Preservation Handbook <xref target="DPC"/>.</t>


</section>
</section>
<section anchor="recommendations" title="Recommendations">

<t>Given the need to balance cost and complexity with retention of information
for historic, legal, and informational purposes, preservation efforts should
focus on the XML canonical format files, the PDF/A-3 format files, the xml2rfc
tool and its documentation, and at least two PDF reader applications capable
of extracting the embedded XML.  Care should be taken that the software being
included in this archive has a provision for free copies for backup or archival
purposes.  
All other formats and the overall computing environment should be
stored as described in "best effort" data retention (<xref
target="best-effort-data-retention"/>), which should in turn be
described in the appropriate vendor contract for the RFC Publisher.</t>


<t>Particular preservation efforts should be made by:</t>

<t><list style='symbols'>

  <t>choosing a format designed for archiving RFCs (PDF/A-3 as indicated by
  <xref target="RFC7995"/>)</t>
  <t>embedding the canonical XML format within the PDF/A-3 file for RFCs</t>
  <t>retaining a copy of the plain-text or XML file submitted for approved I-Ds</t>
  <t>retaining all major versions of the tools and their associated documentation used to acquire and ingest an RFC</t>
<t>retaining the final XML file as well as the PDF/A-3 file with the embedded XML</t>
  <t>retaining at least two software reader applications to ensure the PDF/A-3 and XML files can be viewed in the future</t>
  <t>partnering with other digital archives around the world to mirror copies of the target data</t>
</list></t>

<t>In order to control costs and focus the archiving effort on the entire
content of an RFC, including the metadata and other features embedded within
each RFC published in more than just plain text, printing each RFC to paper upon
publication is no longer reasonable.  Proper data storage and
mirrored copies of RFCs provide more efficient and effective copies in case
of catastrophic failure of the existing archive of material.</t>


<t>Particular focus should be given to finding partners that specialize in
digital preservation to ingest RFCs.  Ideally, they will ingest all material
associated with an RFC, including all metadata, digital signatures, and the
approved I-D that was submitted to the RFC Editor. The possibilities and
options should be discussed with each archival partner; at minimum, they must
ingest copies of RFCs as they are published, with the basic metadata
associated with each document. </t>


<t>Preservation efforts should be reviewed and validated through a biennial
audit that will verify that the targeted content and all its associated
metadata can be read with existing tools.  The full process from acquisition
to ingestion should be reviewed to ensure that best current practice is being
followed from the perspective of the digital archive community.  Since the overall
model for the digital archive maintained by the RFC Editor follows the OAIS reference
model, the associated audit guidelines should also be followed.  While the RFC
Editor does not seek to be recognized as 'OAIS-compliant' at this time, use of
the ISO standard "Space data and information transfer systems -- Audit and
certification of trustworthy digital
repositories" <xref target="ISO16363"/> would provide a solid, accepted method
for structuring an audit for this digital archive.  </t>


</section>
<section anchor="summary" title="Summary">

<t>The RFC Series is worth archiving.  It contains the history of the early
Internet, as well as some of the key standards for Internet technology and
best practice today.  Who knows what the community will create in the future?
There are many ways to preserve the Series, from relying on preservation of
the bits, to focusing on a single file format, to preserving the entire
computing environment.  Each possibility, or permutations of them,
involves risks and requires varying levels of resources.  The goal of this document is
