This document specifies the SIP P-Served-User P-header. This header
field addresses an issue that was found in the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) between an
S-CSCF (Serving Call Session Control Function) and an AS (Application
Server) on the ISC (IMS Service Control) interface. This
header field conveys the identity of the served user and the session
case that applies to this particular communication session and
application invocation.

<section title="Introduction">
<t>
The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IMS (IP Multimedia
Subsystem) uses SIP (RFC 3261 <xref target="RFC3261"/>) as its main signaling
protocol. (For more information on the IMS, a detailed description can
be found in 3GPP TS 23.228 <xref target="3GPP.23.228"/> and 3GPP TS
24.229 <xref target="3GPP.24.229"/>.) 3GPP has identified issues with the linking in of a SIP application server that are most appropriately resolved by defining a new SIP P-header, 
according to the procedures in RFC 3427 <xref target="RFC3427"/>.
</t>
<t>
The remainder of this document is organized as follows. <xref
target="sec-scenarios"/> outlines the problem by using particular service scenarios,  
and <xref target="sec-reqs"/> discusses the requirements derived from
these scenarios. <xref target="sec-header"/> defines the
P-Served-User header field, which meets those requirements,  
<xref target="proxy-behavior"/> specifies the proxy behavior for the new header field,
and <xref target="sec-applicability"/> discusses the applicability and
scope of this new header field.

 <xref target="sec-iana"/> registers
the P-Served-User header field with the IANA, and <xref
target="sec-security"/> discusses the security properties of the
environment where this header field is intended to be used.

<t>
The served user to a proxy or AS is the user whose service profile is
accessed by that proxy or AS when an initial request is received that is
originated by, originated on behalf of, or terminated to that user.
This profile in turn provides some useful information (preferences or
permissions) for processing at a proxy and, potentially, at an AS.

</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Scenarios"
anchor="sec-scenarios">

<section title="General" anchor="sec-scenarios-general">
<t>
In the 3GPP IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem), the S-CSCF (Serving CSCF) is
a SIP proxy that serves as a registrar and handles originating and
terminating session states for users allocated to it. This means that
any call that is originated by a specific user or any call that is
terminated to that specific user will pass through the S-CSCF that is
allocated to that user.

</t>
<t>
At the moment that an S-CSCF is allocated for a specific user, a user
profile is downloaded to the S-CSCF from the HSS (Home Subscriber
Server) over the Cx interface, see 3GPP TS 29.228
<xref target="3GPP.29.228"/>.

 This user profile tells the S-CSCF
whether the user is allowed to originate or terminate calls or whether
an AS needs to be linked in over the ISC interface. The user profile
information that determines whether a particular initial request needs
to be sent to a particular AS is called the initial Filter Criteria (iFC),
see for example 3GPP TS 23.218 <xref target="3GPP.23.218"/>.

</t>
<t>
For an S-CSCF to be able to meet its responsibilities, it needs to
determine on which user's behalf it is performing its tasks and which
session case is applicable for the particular request. (For a
definition of session case, see 3GPP TS 29.228
<xref target="3GPP.29.228"/>). The session case distinguishes the
originating and terminating call cases and determines whether or not the particular user
is registered. 

</t>
<t>
When the S-CSCF determines that for an incoming initial request the
originating call case applies, it determines the served user by
looking at the P-Asserted-Identity header field (RFC 3325
<xref target="RFC3325"/>), which carries the network asserted identity
of the originating user. When, after processing the iFC for this
initial request, the S-CSCF decides to forward the request to an AS,
the AS has to go through a similar process of determining the session
case and the served user. Since it should come to the same conclusion
that this is an originating session case, it also has to look at the
P-Asserted-Identity header field to determine the served user.

</t>
<t>
When the S-CSCF determines that for an incoming initial request the
terminating call case applies, it determines the served user by
looking at the Request-URI (RFC 3261 <xref target="RFC3261"/>), which
carries the identity of the intended terminating user. When, after
processing the iFC for this initial request, the S-CSCF decides to
forward the request to an AS, the AS has to go through a similar
process of determining the session case and the served user. Since it
should come to the same conclusion that this is a terminating session
case, it also has to look at the Request-URI to determine the served
user.

</t>
<t>
In the originating case, it can be observed that while the
P-Asserted-Identity header field just represents the originating user
when it enters the S-CSCF, it is overloaded with another meaning when
it is sent to an AS over the ISC interface. This other meaning is that
it serves as a representation of the served user.

</t>
<t>
In the terminating case, a similar overloading happens to the
Request-URI; while it first only represented the identity of the
intended terminating user, it is overloaded with another meaning when
it is sent to an AS over the ISC interface. This other meaning is that
it serves as a representation of the served user.

</t>
<t>
In basic call scenarios, this does not show up as a problem, but once
more complicated service scenarios (notably forwarding services) need
to be realized, it poses severe limitations. Such scenarios are
brought forward in the following subsections.

</t>
</section>

<section title="Diversion: Continue on Terminating Leg, but Finish
		Subsequent Terminating iFC First"

anchor="sec-scenarios-diversion-terminating">
<t>
Imagine a service scenario where a user B has a terminating service
that diverts the call to a different destination but is required
to still execute subsequent terminating services for the same user.
This means that this particular user has multiple iFC
configured that are applicable for an incoming initial request. When
the S-CSCF receives an initial INVITE request, it analyzes the request
and determines that the session case is for a terminating registered
user, then it determines the served user to be user B by looking at
the Request-URI.

</t>
<t>
Now the S-CSCF starts the iFC processing. The first iFC that matches
the INVITE request causes the INVITE to be forwarded over the ISC
interface to an AS that hosts user B's diversion service by adding
the AS and S-CSCF's own hostnames to the Route header. The S-CSCF adds
an Original Dialog Identifier (ODI) to the S-CSCF's own hostname on
the Route header. This allows the S-CSCF to correlate an INVITE coming
from an AS over the ISC interface to the existing session that
forwarded the INVITE to the AS in the first place. 

</t>
<t>
When the AS receives the initial INVITE request, it analyzes the
request and determines that the session case is for a terminating
registered user, then it determines the served user to be user B by
looking at the Request-URI. Based on some criteria, the diversion
service concludes that the request needs to be diverted to another
user or application C.  It does this by changing the Request-URI to
C. Optionally, it records the Request-URI history by using the
History-Info header field (RFC 4244 <xref target="RFC4244"/>). Then
the AS removes itself from the Route header and routes  the INVITE
request back to the S-CSCF by using the topmost Route header field.

</t>
<t>
When the S-CSCF receives the INVITE over the ISC interface, it can see
that the Route header contains its own hostname and an ODI that
correlates to an existing terminating session for user B. &nbsp;This can be
used by the S-CSCF to analyze whether there are still unexecuted
iFC. (Note that the current behavior of the S-CSCF on receiving an
INVITE with a changed Request-URI is to terminate the iFC processing
and to route the request based on the new Request-URI value.)

</t>
<t>
The process repeats itself. The INVITE is forwarded to the AS that is
associated with this particular iFC. When the AS receives the initial
INVITE request, it analyzes the request and determines that the session
case is for a terminating registered user, then it determines the
served user to be user C by looking at the Request-URI. This is
clearly wrong, as the user being served is still user B. 

</t>
<t>
This scenario clearly shows the problem that occurs when the
Request-URI is overloaded with the meanings "intended target identity"
and "served user" with the operation as described in
<xref target="sec-scenarios-general"/>. And it shows that this use
case can not be realized without introducing a mechanism that conveys
information about the served user from the S-CSCF to the AS. Use of
the History-Info element does not solve this problem as it does not
tell the AS which user is being served; it just presents a history of
diversions that might not be even caused by the systems serving this
particular user. A more detailed analysis on why the History-Info
header field can't be used is provided in
<xref target="app-history-info"/>.

</t>
</section>

<section title="Diversion: Create New Originating Leg and Provide
		Originating iFC Processing"

anchor="sec-scenarios-diversion-originating">
<t>
Imagine a service scenario where a user B has a terminating service
that diverts the call to a different destination. It is required that a
forwarded call leg is handled as an originating call leg and that
originating services for user B are executed. This means that this
particular user has one or more iFC configured that are applicable for
an outgoing initial request.

</t>
<t>
When the S-CSCF receives an initial INVITE request, it analyzes the
request and determines that the session case is for a terminating
registered user, then it determines the served user to be user B by
looking at the Request-URI.

</t>
<t>
Now the S-CSCF starts the iFC processing. The first iFC that matches
the INVITE request causes the INVITE to be forwarded over the ISC
interface to an AS that hosts user B's diversion service by adding
the AS and S-CSCF's own hostnames to the Route header. The S-CSCF adds
an Original Dialog Identifier (ODI) to the S-CSCF's own hostname on
the Route header. This allows the S-CSCF to correlate an INVITE coming
from an AS over the ISC interface to the existing session that
forwarded the INVITE to the AS in the first place. 

</t>
<t>
When the AS receives the initial INVITE request, it analyzes the
request and determines that the session case is for a terminating
registered user, then it determines the served user to be user B by
looking at the Request-URI. Based on some criteria, the diversion
service concludes that the request needs to be diverted to another
user or application C.  &nbsp;It does this by changing the Request-URI to
C. &nbsp;Optionally, it records the Request-URI history by using the
History-Info header field (RFC 4244 <xref target="RFC4244"/>). Then
the AS removes itself from the Route header. To make sure that the
request is handled as a new originating call on behalf of user B, the
AS adds the "orig" parameter to the topmost route header.  Then it
routes  the INVITE request back to the S-CSCF by using this topmost
Route header field.

</t>
<t>
When the S-CSCF receives the INVITE over the ISC interface, it can see
that the topmost Route header contains its own hostname and an "orig"
parameter. Because the topmost Route header contains the "orig"
parameter, the S-CSCF concludes that the INVITE should be handled as
if a call is originated by the served user. The served user is
determined from the P-Asserted-Identity header to be user A. &nbsp;This is
clearly wrong, as the user being served is and should be user B.

</t>
<t>
For the sake of discussion, let's assume that the S-CSCF can determine
that the served user is user B. &nbsp;Then the procedure would continue as
follows: The S-CSCF starts the originating iFC processing, the first
iFC that matches the INVITE request causes the INVITE to be forwarded
over the ISC interface to an AS that hosts an originating service of
user B by adding the AS and S-CSCF's own hostnames to the Route
header. The S-CSCF adds an Original Dialog Identifier (ODI) to the
S-CSCF's own hostname on the Route header. 

</t>
<t>
The INVITE is forwarded to the AS that is associated with this
particular iFC. When the AS receives the initial INVITE request, it
analyzes the request and determines that the session case is for an
originating registered user, then it determines the served user to be
user A by looking at the P-Asserted-Identity. This is clearly wrong,
as the user being served is and should be user B. 

</t>
<t>
This scenario clearly shows the problem that occurs when the
P-Asserted-Identity is overloaded with the meanings "call originator"
and "served user" with the operation as described in 
<xref target="sec-scenarios-general"/>. And it shows that this use
case can not be realized without introducing a mechanism that conveys
information about the served user from the S-CSCF to the AS and from
the AS to the S-CSCF. Use of the History-Info element does not solve
this problem as it does not tell the AS which user is being served,
but just presents a history of diversions that might not be even
caused by the systems serving this particular user. A more detailed
analysis on why the History-Info header field can't be used is
provided in <xref target="app-history-info"/>.

</t>
</section>

<section title="Call Out of the Blue: on Behalf of User B, but Service
		Profile of Service Identity C"

anchor="sec-scenarios-callblue">
<t>
There are services that need to be able to initiate a call, whereby
the call appears to be coming from a user B but the service profile on
behalf of service identity C needs to be executed in the S-CSCF.

</t>
<t>
When a call needs to appear as coming from user B, that means that the
P-Asserted-Identity needs to contain B's identity. This is because the
Originating Identity Presentation (OIP) service as defined in 3GPP TS
24.173 <xref target="3GPP.24.173"/> uses the P-Asserted-Identity to
present the call originator. This makes sense because that is the
main meaning expressed by the P-Asserted-Identity header field.

</t>
<t>
It is clear that no INVITE request can be constructed currently that
would achieve both requirements expressed in the first paragraph,
because the P-Asserted-Identity is overloaded with two meanings on the
ISC interface. When the S-CSCF will receive this request, it will
determine that the served user is user B, which is not what we want to
achieve.

</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Requirements"
anchor="sec-reqs">
<t>
This section lists the requirements derived from the previous scenarios:
</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>
To be able to offer real-world application services, it is required
that the identity of the served user can be conveyed on the ISC
interface (see 3GPP TS 23.218 <xref target="3GPP.23.218"/>).

</t>
<t>
To be able to offer appropriate services to the served user, it is
required that in addition to the served user identity the session case
is conveyed.

</t>
</list>
</t>

</section>

<section title="P-Served-User Header Field Definition"
anchor="sec-header">
<t>
This document defines the SIP P-Served-User P-header. This header
field can be added to initial requests for a dialog or standalone
requests, which are routed between nodes in a Trust Domain for P-Served-User. 

The P-Served-User P-header contains an identity of the user 
that represents the served user. 
The "sescase" parameter may be used to convey whether the
initial request is originated by or destined for the served user. The
"regstate" parameter may be used to
indicate whether the initial request is for a registered or 
unregistered user.

</t>
<t>
The augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) (RFC 5234 <xref target="RFC5234"/>) syntax
of the P-Served-User header field is as follows:

<figure>
<artwork type="ABNF">
P-Served-User            = "P-Served-User" HCOLON PServedUser-value
                           *(SEMI served-user-param)
served-user-param        = sessioncase-param
                           / registration-state-param
                           / generic-param
PServedUser-value        = name-addr / addr-spec
sessioncase-param        = "sescase" EQUAL "orig" / "term" 
registration-state-param = "regstate" EQUAL "unreg" / "reg"

    <t>
      Proxies that support the header MUST only insert the header in

      P-Served-User header to represent the served user in operations
      that require such information.

    </t>
    <t>
   A proxy that supports the header MUST remove the header from

    </t>
  </section>

</section>


<section title="Applicability"
anchor="sec-applicability">
  <t>
    According to RFC 3427 <xref target="RFC3427"/>, P-headers have a
    limited applicability. Specifications of P-headers, such as this RFC,
    need to clearly document the useful scope of the proposal and explain
    its limitations and why it is not suitable for the general use of SIP
    on the Internet.
  </t>
  <t>
    The use of the P-Served-User header field extensions is only applicable inside a Trust
    Domain for served user.  Nodes in such a Trust Domain explicitly trust each other
    to convey the served user and to be responsible for withholding
    that information outside of the Trust Domain.  The means by which
    the network determines the served user and the policies that are
    executed for a specific served user is outside the scope of this
    document.

  </t>
  <t>
    The served user information lacks an indication of who or what specifically
    determined the served user, and so it must be assumed that the Trust
    Domain determined the served user.  Therefore, the information is only
    meaningful when securely received from a node known to be a member of
    the Trust Domain.
  </t>
  <t>
    Because the served user typically only has validity in one
    administrative domain, it is in general not suitable for
    inter-domain use or use in the Internet at large.  

  </t>
  <t>
    Despite these limitations, there are sufficiently useful specialized
    deployments that meet the assumptions described above, and that can accept
    the limitations that result, to warrant informational publication of
    this mechanism.  An example deployment would be a closed network
    like 3GPP IMS.
  </t>
</section>


<section title="IANA Considerations"
anchor="sec-iana">
<t>
This document defines a new SIP header field: P-Served-User. This
header field has been registered by the IANA in the SIP Parameters
registry under the Header Fields subregistry.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Security Considerations"
anchor="sec-security">
<t>
The P-Served-User header field defined in this document is to be used in an
environment where elements are trusted and where attackers are not
supposed to have access to the protocol messages between those
elements. Traffic protection between network elements is sometimes
achieved by using IPsec and sometimes by physically protecting the
network. In any case, the environment where the P-Served-User header
field will be used ensures the integrity and the confidentiality of
the contents of this header field.
</t>
<t>
The Spec(T) that defines the Trust Domain for P-Served-User MUST require
that member nodes understand the P-Served-User header extension.
</t>
<t>
There is a security risk if a P-Served-User header field is
allowed to propagate out of the Trust Domain where it was
generated. In that case, user-sensitive information would be 
revealed. To prevent such a breach from happening,
proxies MUST NOT insert the header when forwarding requests to a 
hop that is
located outside the Trust Domain. When forwarding the request to a
node in the Trust Domain, 
proxies MUST NOT insert the header unless they have sufficient knowledge that 
the route set includes another proxy in the Trust Domain that understands the 
header, such as the home proxy. There is no automatic mechanism to learn the 
support for this specification. Proxies MUST remove the header when
forwarding requests to nodes 
that are not in the Trust Domain or when the proxy does not have
knowledge of any other proxy included in 
the route set that will remove it before it is routed to any node that
is not in the Trust Domain.

    <appendix title="Why the History-Info Header Is Not Suitable to
        Convey the Served User Information on the ISC Interface"

    anchor="app-history-info">
    <section title="Semantics"
    anchor="app-hi-general">
    <t>
    The History-Info (as specified in RFC 4244
    <xref target="RFC4244"/>) holds a record of subsequent Request-URI values 
    that are put on an initial request during its processing in the network.    

    </t>
    <t>
    If it would be possible at all to use the History-Info header for
    the purpose of communicating the served user, then again the same
    overloading would occur as the one that we are trying to get rid
    of (<xref target="sec-scenarios-diversion-terminating"/>). In this
    case, we overload the particular History-Info header
    field's hi-entry with the meaning "historic target identity" and
    "served user". 

    </t>
    <t>
    Another reason that the History-Info header can not solve the
    requirements as expressed in this document is that, in originating
    session case scenarios, the served user is currently determined
    from the P-Asserted-Identity, as that header field contains the
    asserted originating user's identity. The History-Info header,
    being a record of Request-URIs, can never be a solution for this
    case. 

    </t>
    <t>
    Looking at the call-out-of-the-blue scenario
    (<xref target="sec-scenarios-callblue"/>), it is impossible to
    construct a History-Info header for an INVITE request on behalf of
    user C that appears to come from user B and targets user D that
    would express the served user C without violating the original
    semantics of the History-Info header according to (RFC 4244
    <xref target="RFC4244"/>).

    </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Additional Observations"
    anchor="app-hi-arguments">
    <t>
    The purpose of the History-Info header is a header that has an
    end-to-end application. For the purpose of informing an AS on the ISC
    interface, this is overkill.

    </t>
    <t>
    At the moment that the AS receives an initial INVITE over the ISC
    interface, this INVITE may have passed a vast number of proxies
    that may or may not have added history information. On top of
    that, the request may have traversed several AS instances for the
    same served user. In case several subsequent iFC are active, all
    these AS instances may perform a forwarding. This means  that it
    is not possible to define an algorithm that points out which
    hi-entry of a History-Info header should represent the served
    user. In other words, a History-Info header field with n entries
    expresses a branch of depth n. Any or none of these elements could
    be the served user identity.

    </t>
    <t>
    The History-Info header does not comply with the second
    requirement as expressed in <xref target="sec-reqs"/>, as it does
    not have a means to express the session case in a natural way.

    </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Conclusion"
    anchor="app-hi-conclusion">
    <t>
    Each observation in the previous subsections, alone, is enough to
    disregard the History-Info header as an information element that
    is suitable for transporting the served user information over the
    ISC interface. 

    </t>
    <t>
    Note that this does not prohibit the use of the P-Served-User
    header and the History-Info header in the same request. In fact
    that will be a quite likely scenario for network-based diversion
    services like, for example, the Communication Diversion service as
    specified in (3GPP TS 24.173 <xref target="3GPP.24.173"/>).
