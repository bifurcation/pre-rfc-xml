      <t>The Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions (RAMS) solution is a
      method based on RTP and the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)
      that enables an RTP
      receiver to rapidly acquire and start consuming the RTP multicast data.
      Upon a request from the RTP receiver, an auxiliary unicast RTP
      retransmission session is set up between a retransmission server and the
      RTP receiver, over which the reference information about the new
      multicast stream the RTP receiver is about to join is transmitted at an
      accelerated rate. This often precedes, but may also accompany, the
      multicast stream itself. When there is only one multicast stream to be
      acquired, the RAMS solution works in a straightforward manner. However,
      when there are two or more multicast streams to be acquired from the
      same or different multicast RTP sessions, care should be taken to
      configure each RAMS session appropriately. This document provides
      example scenarios and discusses how the RAMS solution could be used in
      such scenarios.</t>

      <t>The Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions (RAMS) solution is a
      method based on RTP and the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)
      that enables an RTP
      receiver to rapidly acquire and start consuming the RTP multicast data.
      Through an auxiliary unicast RTP retransmission session <xref
      target="RFC4588"/>, the RTP receiver receives reference information
      about the new multicast stream it is about to join. This often precedes,
      but may also accompany, the multicast stream itself. The RAMS solution
      is documented in detail in <xref target="RFC6285"/>.</t>

      <t>The RAMS specification <xref target="RFC6285"/> has provisions for
      concurrently acquiring multiple streams inside a multicast RTP session.
      However, the RAMS specification does not discuss scenarios where an RTP
      receiver makes use of the RAMS method to rapidly acquire multiple and
      associated multicast streams in parallel, or where different RTP
      sessions are part of the same Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) session.
      The example presented in Section 8.3 of <xref target="RFC6285"/>
      addresses only the simple case of an RTP receiver rapidly acquiring only
      one multicast stream to explain the protocol details.</t>

      <t>There are certain deployment models where a multicast RTP session
      might have two or more multicast streams associated with it. There are
      also cases where an RTP receiver might be interested in acquiring one
      or more multicast streams from several multicast RTP sessions. Close
      coordination is required for multiple RAMS sessions simultaneously
      started by an RTP server, where each session is initiated with an
      individual RAMS Request message to a different feedback target. In this
      document, we present scenarios from real-life deployments and discuss
      how the RAMS solution could be used in such scenarios.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Background">
      <t>In the following discussion, we assume that there are two RTP streams
      (1 and 2) that are in some manner associated with each other. These
      could be audio and video elementary streams for the same TV channel, or
      they could be an MPEG2 Transport Stream (that has audio and video
      multiplexed together) and its Forward Error Correction (FEC) stream.</t>

      <t>An SSM session is defined by its (distribution) source address and
      (destination) multicast group, and there can be only one feedback target
      per SSM session <xref target="RFC5760"/>. So, if the RTP streams are
      distributed by different sources or over different multicast groups,
      they are considered different SSM sessions. While different SSM sessions
      can normally share the same feedback target address and/or port, RAMS
      requires each unique feedback target (i.e., the combination of address
      and port) to be associated with at most one RTP session (See Section 6.2
      of <xref target="RFC6285"/>).</t>

      <t>Two or more multicast RTP streams can be transmitted in the same RTP
      session (e.g., in a single UDP flow). This is called Synchronization
      Source (SSRC) multiplexing. In this case, (de)multiplexing is done at
      the SSRC level. Alternatively, the multicast RTP streams can be
      transmitted in different RTP sessions (e.g., in different UDP flows),
      which is called session multiplexing. In practice, there are different
      deployment models for each multiplexing scheme.</t>

      <t>Generally, to avoid complications in RTCP reports, it is suggested
      that two different media streams with different clock rates use
      different SSRCs or be carried in different RTP sessions. Some of the
      fields in
      RAMS messages might depend on the clock rate. Thus, in a single RTP
      session, RTP streams carrying payloads with different clock rates need
      to have different SSRCs. Since RTP streams with different SSRCs do not
      share the sequence numbering, each stream needs to be acquired
      individually.</t>

      <t>In the remaining sections, only the relevant portions of the Session
      Description Protocol (SDP)
      descriptions <xref target="RFC4566"/> will be provided. For an example
      of a full SDP description, refer to Section 8.3 of <xref
      target="RFC6285"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec_scenarios" title="Example Scenarios">
      <t/>

      <section title="Scenario #1: Two Multicast Groups">
        <t>This is the scenario for session multiplexing where RTP streams 1
        and 2 are transmitted over different multicast groups. A practical use
        case is where the first and second SSM sessions carry the primary
        video stream and its associated FEC stream, respectively.</t>

        <t>An individual RAMS session is run for each of the RTP streams that
        require rapid acquisition. Each requires a separate RAMS Request
        message to be sent. These RAMS sessions can be run in parallel. If
        they are, the RTP receiver needs to pay attention to using the shared
        bandwidth appropriately among the two unicast bursts. As explained
        earlier, there has to be a different feedback target for these two SSM
        sessions.</t>

          </figure>

        <t>Note that the multicast destination ports in the above SDP do not
        matter, and they could be the same or different. The "FEC-FR" grouping
        semantics are defined in <xref target="RFC5956"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Scenario #2: One Multicast Group">
        <t>Here, RTP streams 1 and 2 are transmitted over the same multicast
        group with different destination ports. A practical use case is where
        the SSM session carries the primary video and audio streams, each
        destined to a different port.</t>

        <t>The RAMS Request message sent by an RTP receiver to the feedback
        target could indicate the desire to acquire all or a subset or one of
        the available RTP streams. Thus, both the primary video and audio
        streams can be acquired rapidly in parallel. Or, the RTP receiver can
        acquire only the primary video or audio stream, if desired, by
        indicating the specific SSRC in the request. Compared to the previous
        scenario, the only difference is that in this case the join times for
        both streams need to be coordinated as they are delivered in the same
        multicast session.</t>

          </figure>

        <t>Note that the destination ports in "m" lines need to be distinct
        per <xref target="RFC5888"/>.</t>

        <t>If RTP streams 1 and 2 share the same distribution source, then
        there is only one SSM session, which means that there can be only one
        feedback target (as shown in the SDP description above). This requires
        RTP streams 1 and 2 to have their own unique SSRC values (also as
        shown in the SDP description above). If RTP streams 1 and 2 do not
        share the same distribution source, meaning that their respective SSM
        sessions can use different feedback target transport addresses, then
        their SSRC values do not have to be different from each other.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Scenario #3: SSRC Multiplexing">
        <t>This is the scenario for SSRC multiplexing where both RTP streams
        are transmitted over the same multicast group to the same destination
        port. This is a less practical scenario, but it could be used where the
        SSM session carries both the primary video and audio stream, destined
        to the same port.</t>

        <t>Similar to scenario #2, both the primary video and audio streams
        can be acquired rapidly in parallel. Or, the RTP receiver can acquire
        only the primary video or audio stream, if desired, by indicating the
        specific SSRC in the request. In this case, there is only one
        distribution source and the destination multicast address is shared.
        Thus, there is always one SSM session and one feedback target.</t>

      <section title="Scenario #4: Payload-Type Multiplexing">
        <t>This is the scenario for payload-type multiplexing.</t>

        <t>In this case, instead of two, there is only one RTP stream (and one
        RTP session) carrying both payload types (e.g., media payload and its
        FEC data). While this scheme is permissible per <xref
        target="RFC3550"/>, it has several drawbacks. For example, RTP packets
        carrying different payload formats will share the same sequence
        numbering space, and the RAMS operations will not be able to be
        applied based on the payload type. For other drawbacks and details,
        see Section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC3550"/>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Feedback Target and SSRC Signaling Issues">
      <t>The RAMS protocol uses the common packet format from <xref
      target="RFC4585"/>, which has a field to signal the media sender SSRC.
      The SSRCs for the RTP streams can be signaled out-of-band in the SDP or
      could be learned from the RTP packets once the transmission starts. In
      RAMS, the latter cannot be used.</t>

      <t>Signaling the media sender SSRC value helps the feedback target
      correctly identify the RTP stream to be acquired. If a feedback target
      is serving multiple SSM sessions on a particular port, all the RTP
      streams in these SSM sessions are supposed to have a unique SSRC value.
      However, this is not an easy requirement to satisfy. Thus, the RAMS
      specification forbids having more than one RTP session associated
      with a specific feedback target on a specific port.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="FEC during RAMS and Bandwidth Issues ">
      <t>Suppose that RTP stream 1 denotes the primary video stream that has a
      bitrate of 10 Mbps and RTP stream 2 denotes the associated FEC stream
      that has a bitrate of 1 Mbps. Also assume that the RTP receiver knows
      that it can receive data at a maximum bitrate of 22 Mbps. SDP can
      specify the bitrate ("b=" line in kbps) of each media session (per "m"
      line).</t>

      <t>Note that RAMS can potentially congest the network temporarily. Refer
      to <xref target="RFC6285"/> for a detailed discussion.</t>

      <section title="Scenario #1">
        <t>This is the scenario for session multiplexing where RTP streams 1
        and 2 are transmitted over different multicast groups.</t>

        <t>This is the preferred deployment model for FEC <xref
        target="RFC6363"/>. Having FEC in a different multicast group provides
        two flexibility points: RTP receivers that are not FEC capable can
        receive the primary video stream without FEC, and RTP receivers that
        are FEC capable can decide to not receive FEC during the rapid
        acquisition (but still start receiving the FEC stream after the
        acquisition of the primary video stream has been completed).</t>

        <t>If the RTP receiver does not want to receive FEC until the
        acquisition of the primary video stream is completed, the total
        available bandwidth can be used for faster acquisition of the primary
        video stream. In this case, the RTP receiver can request a Max Receive
        Bitrate of 22 Mbps in the RAMS Request message for the primary video
        stream. Once RAMS has been completed, the RTP receiver can join the
        FEC multicast session, if desired.</t>

        <t>If the RTP receiver wants to rapidly acquire both primary and FEC
        streams, it needs to allocate the total bandwidth among the two RAMS
        sessions and indicate individual Max Receive Bitrate values in each
        respective RAMS Request message. Since less bandwidth will be used to
        acquire the primary video stream, the acquisition of the primary video
        session will take a longer time on the average.</t>

        <t>While the RTP receiver can update the Max Receive Bitrate values
        during the course of the RAMS session, this approach is more
        error-prone, due to the possibility of losing the update messages.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Scenario #2">
        <t>Here, RTP streams 1 (primary video) and 2 (FEC) are transmitted over

        target could indicate the desire to acquire all or a subset or one of

        streams can be acquired rapidly in parallel sharing the same available
        bandwidth. Or, the RTP receiver can acquire only the primary video
        stream by indicating its specific SSRC in the request. In this case,
        the RTP receiver can first acquire the primary video stream at the
        full receive bitrate. But, upon the multicast join, the available
        bandwidth for the burst drops to 11 Mbps instead of 12&nbsp;Mbps.
        Regardless of whether FEC is desired or not by the RTP receiver, its
        bitrate needs to be taken into account once the RTP receiver joins the

        <t>Similar to scenario #2, both the primary video and audio streams
        can be acquired rapidly in parallel. Or, the RTP receiver can acquire
        only the primary video stream, if desired, by indicating its specific
        SSRC in the request.</t>

        <t>Note that based on the "a=fmtp" line for the FEC stream, it could
        be possible to infer the bitrate of this FEC stream and set the Max
        Receive Bitrate value accordingly.</t>
