    <abstract>
      <t>On inter-router point-to-point links, it is useful, for security and
      other reasons, to use 127-bit IPv6 prefixes. Such a practice parallels
      the use of 31-bit prefixes in IPv4.
      This document specifies the motivation for, and usages of,
      127-bit IPv6 prefix lengths on inter-router point-to-point links.</t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t><xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC4291"></xref>
      specifies that interface IDs for all unicast addresses, except those
      that start with the binary value 000, are required to
      be 64 bits long and to be constructed in Modified EUI-64 format. In
      addition, it defines the Subnet-Router anycast address, which is
      intended to be used for applications where a node needs to communicate
      with any one of the set of routers on a link.</t>

      <t>Some operators have been using 127-bit prefixes, but this has been
      discouraged due to conflicts with Subnet-Router anycast <xref
      format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3627"></xref>. However, using
      64-bit prefixes creates security issues that are particularly
      problematic on inter-router links, and there are other valid reasons to
      use prefixes longer than 64 bits, in particular /127 (see <xref
      format="default" pageno="false" target="Rationale"></xref>).</t>

      <t>This document provides a rationale for using 127-bit prefix lengths,
      reevaluates the reasons why doing so was considered harmful, and
      specifies how /127 prefixes can be used on inter-router links configured
      for use as point-to-point links.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Scope" title="Scope of This Memo" toc="default">
      <t>This document is applicable to cases where operators assign specific
      addresses on inter-router point-to-point links and do not rely on
      link-local addresses. Many operators assign specific addresses for the
      purposes of network monitoring, reverse DNS resolution for traceroute
      and other management tools, External Border Gateway Protocol (EBGP)
      <xref target="RFC4271"/> peering sessions, and so on.</t>

      <t>For the purposes of this document, an inter-router point-to-point
      link is a link to which only two routers and no hosts are attached. This
      may include Ethernet links that are configured to be point-to-point.
      Links between a router and a host, or links to which both routers and
      hosts are attached, are out of scope of this document.</t>

      <t>The recommendations in this document do not apply to the link-local
      address scope.</t>

    <section anchor="Problems"
             title="Problems Identified with 127-Bit Prefix Lengths in the Past"
             toc="default">
      <t><xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3627"></xref>
      discourages the use of 127-bit prefix lengths due to conflicts with the
      Subnet-Router anycast addresses, while stating that the utility of
      Subnet-Router anycast for point-to-point links is questionable.</t>

      <t><xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5375"></xref> also
      says the usage of 127-bit prefix lengths is not valid and should be
      strongly discouraged, but the stated reason for doing this is to be in
      compliance with <xref format="default" pageno="false"
      target="RFC3627"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Though the analyses in the RFCs are correct, operational experience
      with IPv6 has shown that /127 prefixes can be used successfully.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Rationale" title="Reasons for Using Longer Prefixes"
             toc="default">
      <t>There are reasons network operators use IPv6 prefix lengths greater
      than 64, particularly 127, for inter-router point-to-point links.</t>

      <section anchor="Pingpong" title="Ping-Pong Issue" toc="default">
        <t>A forwarding loop may occur on a point-to-point link with a prefix
        length shorter than 127. This does not affect interfaces that perform
        Neighbor Discovery, but some point-to-point links, which use a medium
        such as the Synchronous Optical Network (SONET),
        do not use Neighbor Discovery. As a consequence,
        configuring any prefix length shorter than 127 bits on these links can
        create an attack vector in the network.</t>

        <t>The ping-pong issue happens in the case of IPv4 as well.
        But due to the
        scarcity of IPv4 address space, the current practice is to assign long
        prefix lengths such as /30 or /31 <xref format="default"
        pageno="false" target="RFC3021"></xref> on point-to-point links; thus,
        the problem did not come to the fore.</t>

        <t>The latest ICMPv6 specification <xref format="default"
        pageno="false" target="RFC4443"></xref> mitigates this problem by
        specifying that a router receiving a packet on a
        point-to-point link, where the packet is destined to an address
        within a subnet assigned to that same
        link (other than one of the receiving router's own addresses), MUST
        NOT forward the packet back on that link. Instead, it SHOULD generate
        an ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable message (code 3) in response. This
        check is on the forwarding processing path, so it may have performance
        impact.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="Neighbor Cache" title="Neighbor Cache Exhaustion Issue"
               toc="default">
        <t>As described in Section 4.3.2 of <xref format="default"
        pageno="false" target="RFC3756"></xref>, the use of a 64-bit prefix
        length on an inter-router link that uses Neighbor Discovery (e.g.,
        Ethernet) potentially allows for denial-of-service attacks on the
        routers on the link.</t>

        <t>Consider an Ethernet link between two routers, A and B, to
        which a
        /64 subnet has been assigned. A packet sent to any address on the /64
        (except the addresses of A and B) will cause the router attempting to
        forward it to create a new cache entry in INCOMPLETE state, send a
        Neighbor Solicitation message on the link, start a retransmit timer,
        and so on <xref format="default" pageno="false"
        target="RFC4861"></xref>.</t>

        <t>By sending a continuous stream of packets to a large number of the
        2^64 - 3 unassigned addresses on the link (one for each router and one
        for Subnet-Router anycast), an attacker can create a large number of
        neighbor cache entries and cause one of the routers to send a large
        number of Neighbor
        Solicitation packets that will never receive replies, thereby
        consuming large amounts of memory and processing resources. Sending
        the packets to one of the 2^24 addresses on the link that has the
        same Solicited-Node multicast address as one of the routers also
        causes the victim to spend large amounts of processing time discarding
        useless Neighbor Solicitation messages.</t>

        <t>Careful implementation and rate-limiting can limit the impact of
        such an attack, but are unlikely to neutralize it completely.
        Rate-limiting Neighbor Solicitation messages will reduce CPU usage,
        and following the garbage-collection recommendations in <xref
        format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC4861"></xref> will maintain
        reachability, but if the link is down and neighbor cache entries have
        expired while the attack is ongoing, legitimate traffic (for example,
        BGP sessions) over the link might never be re&nbhy;established,
        because the
        routers cannot resolve each others' IPv6 addresses to link-layer
        addresses.</t>

        <t>This attack is not specific to point-to-point links, but is
        particularly harmful in the case of point-to-point backbone links,
        which may carry large amounts of traffic to many destinations over
        long distances.</t>

        <t>While there are a number of ways to mitigate this kind of issue,
        assigning /127 subnets eliminates it completely.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="Others" title="Other Reasons" toc="default">
        <t>Though address space conservation considerations are less important
        for IPv6 than they are in IPv4, some operators prefer not to assign
        /64s to individual point-to-point links. Instead, they may be able to
        number all of their point-to-point links out of a single /64 or a small
        number of /64s.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Recommendations" title="Recommendations" toc="default">
      <t>Routers MUST support the assignment of /127 prefixes on
      point-to-point inter-router links. Routers MUST disable Subnet-Router
      anycast for the prefix when /127 prefixes are used.</t>

      <t>When assigning and using any /127 prefixes, the following
      considerations apply. Some addresses have special meanings, in
      particular addresses corresponding to reserved anycast addresses. When
      assigning prefixes (and addresses) to links, care should be taken to
      ensure that addresses reserved for such purposes aren't inadvertently
      assigned and used as unicast addresses. Otherwise, nodes may receive
      packets that they are not intended to receive. Specifically, assuming
      that a number of point-to-point links will be numbered out of a single
      /64 prefix:

      <list style="format (%c)">
          <t>Addresses with all zeros in the rightmost 64 bits SHOULD NOT
          be assigned as unicast addresses, to avoid colliding with the
          Subnet-Router anycast address <xref format="default" pageno="false"
          target="RFC4291"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Addresses in which the rightmost 64 bits are assigned the
          highest 128 values (i.e., ffff:ffff:ffff:ff7f to
          ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff) SHOULD NOT be used as unicast addresses, to
          avoid colliding with reserved subnet anycast addresses <xref
