			<t>
				Opportunistic Secure Real-time Transport
				Protocol (OSRTP) is an implementation of the
				Opportunistic Security mechanism, as defined
				in RFC 7435, applied to
				the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). OSRTP
				allows encrypted media to be used in
				environments where support for encryption is
				not known in advance and is					not required. OSRTP does not require Session Description Protocol (SDP) extensions or features and is fully backwards compatible with existing implementations using encrypted and authenticated media	and implementations that do not encrypt or authenticate media packets.  OSRTP is not specific to any key management technique for Secure RTP (SRTP).  OSRTP is a	transitional approach useful for migrating existing deployments of real-time communications to a fully encrypted and authenticated state.

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>
				Opportunistic Security (OS) <xref target="RFC7435" /> is an approach to security that defines a third mode for security between "cleartext" and 
				"comprehensive protection" that allows encryption and authentication of media to be used if supported but will not result in failures if it is not supported. 

<!-- [rfced] FYI, we made these two changes; please let us know if
they are not correct.
- changed "is" to "its".
- changed "Audio Video Profile" to "Audio-Visual Profile" to match 
usage in past RFCs including RFC 4585.

Original:
   In the context of the transport of secure media
   streams using RTP and is secured derivatives, cleartext is
   represented by an RTP [RFC3550] media stream which is negotiated with
   the RTP/AVP (Audio Video Profile) [RFC3551] or the RTP/AVPF profile
   [RFC4585] ...

Current:
   In the context of the transport of secure media
   streams using RTP and its secured derivatives, cleartext is
   represented by an RTP [RFC3550] media stream which is negotiated with
   the RTP/AVP (Audio-Visual Profile) [RFC3551] or the RTP/AVPF profile
   [RFC4585] ...
-->

				In the context of the transport of secure
				media streams using RTP and its secured
				derivatives, cleartext is represented by an
				RTP <xref target="RFC3550" />
				media stream that is negotiated with the
				RTP/AVP (Audio-Visual Profile) <xref target="RFC3551" /> or the RTP/AVPF profile <xref target="RFC4585" />,						whereas comprehensive protection is represented by a Secure RTP <xref target="RFC3711" /> stream negotiated with a secure profile, such as SAVP or SAVPF					<xref target="RFC5124" />.  OSRTP allows SRTP to be negotiated with the RTP/AVP profile, with fallback to RTP if SRTP is not supported.
			</t>

			<t>
				There have been some extensions to SDP to
				allow profiles to be negotiated, such as SDP
				Capabilities Negotiation (SDPCapNeg) <xref
				target="RFC5939"/>.  However, these approaches
				are complex and have very limited deployment
				in communication systems.  Other key
				management protocols for SRTP that have been
				developed, such as ZRTP <xref target="RFC6189"
				/>, use OS by design.   This approach for OSRTP is based on <xref target="Kaplan06" /> where it was called "best effort SRTP".  <xref target="Kaplan06" /> has a full discussion of the motivation and requirements for opportunistic secure media.
			</t>
			<t>
				OSRTP uses the presence of SRTP keying-related
				attributes in an SDP offer to indicate support
				for opportunistic secure media.  The presence
				of SRTP keying-related attributes in the SDP
				answer indicates that the other party also
				supports OSRTP and that encrypted and authenticated media will be used. OSRTP requires no additional extensions to SDP or new attributes and is defined independently of the key agreement mechanism used.  OSRTP is only usable when media is negotiated using the Offer/Answer protocol <xref target="RFC3264" />.
			</t>
			<section title="Applicability Statement">
				<t>
					OSRTP is a transitional approach that provides a migration path from unencrypted communication (RTP) to fully encrypted communication (SRTP).  It is only to be used in existing deployments that are attempting to transition to fully secure communications.  New applications and new deployments will not use OSRTP.

		<section title="SDP Offer/Answer Considerations">

			<t>
				This section defines the SDP offer/answer considerations for opportunistic security.
			</t>
			<t>
				The procedures are for a specific "m=" section describing RTP-based media. If an SDP offer or answer contains multiple such "m=" sections, the procedures are applied to each "m=" section individually.
			</t>
			<t>
				"Initial OSRTP offer" refers to the offer in which opportunistic security is offered for an "m=" section for the first time within an SDP session.
			</t>
			<t>
				It is important to note that OSRTP makes no
				changes to and has no effect on media sessions in which the offer contains a secure profile of RTP, such as SAVP or SAVPF. As discussed in <xref target="RFC7435" />, that is the "comprehensive protection" for media mode.
			</t>


			<section anchor="InitialOffer" title="Generating the Initial OSRTP Offer">

				<t>
					To indicate support for OSRTP in an SDP offer, the offerer uses the RTP/AVP profile <xref target="RFC3551" /> or the RTP/AVPF profile 
					<xref target="RFC4585" /> but includes SRTP keying attributes. OSRTP is not specific to any key management technique for SRTP, and multiple key management techniques can be included on the SDP offer. For example:
				</t>
				<t>
					<list>
						<t>
							If the offerer
							supports DTLS-SRTP key
							agreement <xref
							target="RFC5763" />,
							then an
							"a=fingerprint"
							attribute will be
							present. Or:
						</t>
					</list>
					<list>
						<t>
							If the offerer
							supports SDP Security
							Descriptions key
							agreement <xref
							target="RFC4568" />,
							then an "a=crypto"
							attribute will be
							present. Or:
						</t>
					</list>
					<list>
						<t>
							If the offerer supports ZRTP key agreement <xref target="RFC6189" />, then an "a=zrtp-hash" attribute will be present.
						</t>
					</list>
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Generating the Answer">
				<t>
					To accept OSRTP, an answerer receiving
					an offer indicating support for OSRTP
					generates an SDP answer containing
					SRTP keying attributes that match 
					one of the keying methods in the offer. The answer MUST NOT contain attributes from more than one keying method, even if the offer contained 
					multiple keying method attributes.  The selected SRTP key management approach is followed, and SRTP media is used for this session.
					If the SRTP key management fails for any reason, the media session MUST fail.  To decline OSRTP, the answerer generates an SDP answer 
					omitting SRTP keying attributes, and the media session proceeds with RTP with no encryption or authentication used.
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Offerer Processing the Answer">
				<t>
					If the offerer of OSRTP receives an SDP answer that does not contain SRTP keying attributes, then the media session proceeds with RTP.  
					If the SDP answer contains SRTP keying attributes, then the associated SRTP key management approach is followed and SRTP media is used for this session. 
				    If the SRTP key management fails, the media session MUST fail.
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Modifying the Session">
				<t>
					When an offerer generates a subsequent SDP offer, it should do so following the principles of <xref target="RFC6337" />, meaning that the decision to create the new SDP offer should not be influenced by what was previously negotiated. For example, if a previous OSRTP offer did not result in SRTP being established, the offerer may try again and generate a new OSRTP offer as specified in <xref target="InitialOffer"/>.
				</t>
			</section>
		</section>

		<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
			<t>
				The security considerations of <xref
				target="RFC4568" /> apply to OSRTP, as well as
				the security considerations of the particular
				SRTP key agreement approach used.  However,
				the authentication requirements of a
				particular SRTP key agreement approach are
				relaxed when that key agreement is used with
				OSRTP, which is consistent with the
				Opportunistic Security approach described in <xref target="RFC7435" />.  For example:
			</t>
			<t>
				<list>
					<t>
						For DTLS-SRTP key agreement <xref target="RFC5763" />, an authenticated signaling channel does not need to be used with OSRTP if it is not available.
					</t>
				</list>
				<list>
					<t>
						For SDP Security Descriptions key agreement <xref target="RFC4568" />, an authenticated signaling channel does not need to be used with OSRTP if it is not available, although an encrypted signaling channel MUST still be used.
					</t>
				</list>
				<list>
					<t>
						For ZRTP key agreement <xref target="RFC6189" />, the security considerations are unchanged, since ZRTP does not rely on the security of the signaling channel.
					</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>
				While OSRTP does not require authentication of
				the key agreement mechanism, it does need to
				avoid exposing SRTP keys to eavesdroppers,
				since this could enable passive attacks
				against SRTP. 


Section 8.3 of <xref
				target="RFC4568"/> requires that any messages
				that contain SRTP keys be encrypted, and
				further says that encryption
				SHOULD provide end-to-end
				confidentiality protection if intermediaries
				that could inspect the SDP message are
				present. At the time of this writing, it is
				understood that the requirement in <xref target="RFC4568"/>  for end-to-end confidentiality protection is commonly ignored. Therefore, if OSRTP is used with SDP Security Descriptions, any such intermediaries (e.g., SIP proxies) must be assumed to have access to the SRTP keys.
			</t>
			<t>
				As discussed in <xref target="RFC7435" />,
				OSRTP is used in cases where support for
				encryption by the other party is not known in
				advance and is not required.  For cases where it is known that the other party supports SRTP or SRTP needs to be used, OSRTP MUST NOT be used.  Instead, a secure profile of RTP is used in the offer.
