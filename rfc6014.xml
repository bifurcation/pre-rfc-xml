<abstract>

<t>This document specifies how DNSSEC cryptographic algorithm
identifiers in the IANA registries are allocated. It changes the requirement
from "standard required" to "RFC Required". It does not change the
list of algorithms that are recommended or required for DNSSEC
implementations.</t>

</abstract>

<section title="Introduction">

<t><xref target='RFC2535'/> specifies that the IANA registry for DNS
Security Algorithm Numbers be updated by IETF Standards Action only,
with the exception of two values -- 253 and 254. In essence, this means
that for an algorithm to get its own entry in the registry, the
algorithm must be defined in an RFC on the Standards Track as defined in
<xref target='RFC2026'/>. The requirement from RFC 2535 is repeated in <xref
target='RFC3755'/> and the combination of <xref target='RFC4033'/>, <xref
target='RFC4034'/>, and <xref target='RFC4035'/>.</t>

<t>RFC 2535 allows algorithms that are not on the Standards Track to use
private values 253 and 254 in signatures. In each case, an
unregistered private name must be included with each use of the
algorithm in order to differentiate different algorithms that use the
value.</t>

</section>

<section title='Requirements for Assignments in the DNS Security
Algorithm Numbers Registry'>

<t>This document changes the requirement for registration from requiring a
Standards Track RFC to requiring a published RFC of any type. There are 
two reasons for relaxing the requirement:</t>

<t><list style='symbols'>

<t>There are some algorithms that are useful that may not be able
to be in a Standards Track RFC.  For any number of
reasons, an algorithm might not have been evaluated thoroughly
enough to be able to be put on the Standards Track.  Another
example is that the algorithm might have unclear intellectual
property rights that prevents the algorithm from being put on
the Standards Track.</t>

<t>Although the size of the registry is restricted (about 250
entries), new algorithms are proposed infrequently. It could
easily be many decades before there is any reason to consider
restricting the registry again.</t>

</list></t>

<t>Some developers will care about the standards level of the RFCs
that are in the registry. The registry has been updated to reflect the current
standards level of each algorithm listed.</t>

<t>To address concerns about the registry eventually filling up, the
IETF should re-evaluate the requirements for entry into this registry
when approximately 120 of the registry entries have been assigned.
That evaluation may lead to tighter restrictions or a new mechanism
for extending the size of the registry. In order to make this
evaluation more likely, IANA has marked about half of the
currently available entries as "Reserved" in order to make the timing
for that re-evaluation more apparent.</t>

<t>The private-use values, 253 and 254, are still useful for
developers who want to test, in private, algorithms for which there
is no RFC. This document does not change the semantics of those two
values.</t>

</section>

<section title='Expectations for Implementations'>

<t>It is important to note that, according to RFC 4034, DNSSEC
implementations are not expected to include all of the algorithms
listed in the IANA registry; in fact, RFC 4034 and the IANA registry
list an algorithm that implementations should not include. This
document does nothing to change the expectation that there will be
items listed in the IANA registry that need not be (and in some
cases, should not be) included in all implementations.</t>

<t>There are many reasons why a DNSSEC implementation might not
include one or more of the algorithms listed, even those on the
Standards Track. In order to be compliant with RFC 4034, an
implementation only needs to implement the algorithms listed as
mandatory to implement in that standard, or updates to that standard.
This document does nothing to change the list of mandatory-to-implement algorithms in RFC 4034. This document does not change the
requirements for when an algorithm becomes mandatory to implement.
Such requirements should come in a separate, focused document.</t>

<t>It should be noted that the order of algorithms in the IANA
registry does not signify or imply cryptographic strength or
preference.</t>

</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">

<t>This document updates allocation requirements for unassigned values in
the "Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers" registry located
at <eref target='http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers'>http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers</eref>,
in the sub-registry titled "DNS Security Algorithm Numbers".

The registration procedure for values that are assigned after this
document is published is "RFC Required".</t>

<t>IANA has marked values 123 through 251 as "Reserved".

The registry notes that this reservation is made in RFC &rfc.number; (this RFC) 
so that when most of the unreserved values are taken, future users and IANA 
will have a pointer to where the reservation originated and its purpose. 

</t>

<t>IANA has added a textual notation to the "References"
column in the registry that gives the current standards status for
each RFC that is listed in the registry.</t>


</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>An algorithm described in an RFC that is not on the Standards
Track may have weaker security than one that is on the Standards
Track; in fact, that may be the reason that the algorithm was not
allowed on Standards Track. Note, however, that not being on the
Standards Track does not necessarily mean that an algorithm is
weaker. Conversely, algorithms that are on the Standards Track should
not necessarily be considered better than algorithms that are not on
the Standards Track. There are other reasons (such as intellectual
property concerns) that can keep algorithms that are widely
considered to be strong off the Standards Track.</t>

<section title="Experimental and Documentation Values">

<t>During the early discussion of this document, it was proposed that
maybe there should be a small number of values reserved for
"experimental" purposes. This proposal was not included in this
document because of the long history in the IETF of experimental
values that became permanent. That is, a developer would release
(maybe "experimentally") a version of software that had the
experimental value associated with a particular extension,
competitors would code their systems to test interoperability, and
then no one wanted to change the values in their software to the
"real" value that was later assigned.</t>

<t>There was also a proposal that IANA should reserve two values to
be used in documentation only, similar to the way that "example.com"
has been reserved as a domain name. That proposal was also not
included in this document because all values need to be associated
with some algorithm, and there is no problem with having examples
that point to commonly deployed algorithms.</t>
