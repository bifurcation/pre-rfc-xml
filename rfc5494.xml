<t>This document specifies the IANA guidelines for allocating new
values in the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). This document also
reserves some numbers for experimentation purposes. The changes also

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>This document specifies the IANA guidelines
<xref target='RFC5226'/> for allocating new values for various fields
in the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) <xref target='RFC0826'/>. The
change is also applicable to extensions of ARP that use the same
message format, such as <xref target="RFC0903"/>,
<xref target="RFC1931"/>, and <xref target="RFC2390"/>.</t>

<t>The change also affects other protocols that employ values from the
ARP name spaces. For instance, the ARP hardware address type (ar$hrd)
number space is also used in the "htype" (hardware address type)
fields in the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) <xref target="RFC0951"/> and
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) <xref target="RFC2131"/>,
as well as in the "hardware type" field in the DHCP Unique Identifiers
in DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC3315"/>. These protocols are therefore
affected by the update in the IANA rules. Other affected
specifications include the specialized address resolution mechanisms
in:
<list style="symbols">
<t>HYPERchannel <xref target="RFC1044"/></t>

<t>DHCP options
<xref target="RFC2132"/> <xref target="RFC4361"/></t> 

<t>ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) ARP <xref target="RFC2225"/></t> 

<t>HARP (High-Performance Parallel Interface ARP) <xref target="RFC2834"/>
<xref target="RFC2835"/></t>

<t>Dual MAC (Media Access Control) FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data
Interface) ARP <xref target="RFC1329"/></t>

<t>MAPOS (Multiple Access Protocol over Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Digital
Hierarchy) ARP <xref target="RFC2176"/></t> 

<t>FC (Fibre Channel) ARP
<xref target="RFC4338"/></t>

<t>DNS DHCID Resource Record
<xref target="RFC4701"/></t>

</list>
</t>
<t>The IANA guidelines are given in
<xref target="ianarules"/>. Previously, no IANA guidance existed for
such allocations. The purpose of this document is to allow IANA to
manage number assignments based on these guidelines in a consistent
manner.</t>

<t>This document also reserves some numbers for experimentation
purposes. These numbers are given in <xref target="expalloc"/>.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="ianarules" title="IANA Considerations">

<t>The following rules apply to the fields of ARP:

<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="ar$hrd (16 bits) Hardware address space"><vspace blankLines="1"/> 

Requests for ar$hrd values below 256 or for a batch of more than one new
value are made through Expert Review
<xref target="RFC5226"/>.<vspace blankLines="1"/>

Note that certain protocols, such as BOOTP and DHCPv4, employ these
values within an 8-bit field.  The expert should determine that a
need to allocate the new values exists and that the existing values
are insufficient to represent the new hardware address types.  The
expert should also determine the applicability of the request and
assign values higher than 255 for requests that do not apply to
BOOTP/DHCPv4.  Similarly, the expert should assign 1-octet values
for requests that apply to BOOTP/DHCPv4, as for example the "IPsec
tunnel" with value 31 <xref target="RFC3456"/>.  Conversely, ARP-only
uses, without a foreseeable reason to use the same value in
BOOTP/DHCPv4, should favor 2-octet values.<vspace blankLines="1"/>

Requests for individual new ar$hrd values that do not specify a value,
or where the requested value is greater than 255, are made through
First Come First Served <xref target="RFC5226"/>. The assignment
will always result in a 2-octet value.

</t>

<t hangText="ar$pro (16 bits) Protocol address space"><vspace blankLines="1"/> 
These numbers share the Ethertype space.  The Ethertype space is administered as described in
<xref target="RFC5342"/>.</t>

<t hangText="ar$op (16 bits) Opcode"><vspace blankLines="1"/> 
Requests for new ar$op values are made through IETF Review or IESG Approval
<xref target="RFC5226"/>.</t>

</list></t>

</section>

<section anchor="expalloc" title="Allocations Defined in This Document">

<t>When testing new protocol extension ideas, it is often necessary to
use an actual constant in order to use the new function, even when
testing in a closed environment. This document reserves the following
numbers for experimentation purposes in ARP:

<list style="symbols">

<t>Two new ar$hrd values are allocated for experimental purposes:
HW_EXP1 (36) and HW_EXP2 (256). Note that these two new values were
  purposely chosen so that one would be below 256 and the other would
  be above 255, and so that there would be different values in the
  least and most significant octets.</t>

<t>Two new values for the ar$op are allocated for experimental
purposes: OP_EXP1 (24) and OP_EXP2 (25).</t>

</list></t>

<t>Note that Appendix B.2 of <xref target="RFC5342"/> lists two
Ethertypes that can be used for experimental purposes.</t>

<t>In addition, for both ar$hrd and ar$op, the values 0 and 65535 are
marked as reserved. This means that they are not available for
allocation.</t>

</section>

<section title='Security Considerations'>

<t>This specification does not change the security properties
of the affected protocols.</t>

<t>However, a few words are necessary about the use of the
experimental code points defined in
<xref target="expalloc"/>. Potentially harmful side effects from the
use of the experimental values need to be carefully evaluated before
deploying any experiment across networks that the owner of the
experiment does not entirely control. Guidance given in
<xref target="RFC3692"/> about the use of experimental values needs to
be followed.</t>

</section>

<section title="Acknowledgments">

<t>The lack of any current rules has come up as new values were
requested from IANA, who contacted the IESG for advice. The author
would like to thank Michelle Cotton in particular for bringing up this
issue. The author would also like to thank Brian Carpenter, Thomas
Narten, Scott Bradner, Donald Eastlake, Andrew G. Malis, Brian
Haberman, Robert Sparks, Larry Zhu, and Dave Thaler for feedback.</t>

<section title="Changes from the Original RFCs">

<t>This document specifies only the IANA rules associated with various
fields in ARP.  The specification of these rules also affects the
allocation of corresponding fields in protocols listed
in <xref target="intro"/> that share the registry. This document does
not make any changes in the operation of these protocols
themselves.</t>
