    <abstract>
       <t>This text documents the current usage of P-Charge-Info, 
       an existing Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) private header field (P-Header) 
       used to convey billing information about the party to be charged.  
       This P-Header is currently used in production by several equipment 
       vendors and carriers and has been in use since at least 2007. This document 
       details the registration of this header field with IANA. </t>

    </abstract>

    <section title="Overview">
        <t>In certain network configurations, several network entities have found
        it useful to decouple
	the identity of the caller (what is normally thought of as "Caller
	ID") from the identity/number used for billing purposes.  This
	document records the current usage of P&#8209;Charge&#8209;Info, a private
	SIP header field, to provide simple billing information and details the
	registration of this header field with IANA as required by Section 4 of
	 <xref target="RFC5727"/>.</t>
	
	<t>In a typical configuration, the identity of the caller, commonly
	referred to as "Caller ID" by end users, is derived from one of the
	following SIP header fields:<list style="symbols">
	   <t>P-Asserted-Identity</t>
	   <t>From (in the absence of P-Asserted-Identity)</t>
	</list>(NOTE: Some service providers have also used the
	Remote-Party-ID header field, but this was never standardized and 
	was replaced by P&#8209;Asserted&#8209;Identity in <xref target="RFC3325"/>.)</t>
	<t>This identity/number is typically presented to the receiving user
	agent (UA), where
	it is usually displayed for the end user.  It is also typically
	used for billing purposes by the network entities involved in
	carrying the session.  </t>
	<t>However, in some network configurations, the "Caller ID" presented
	to the receiving UA may be different from the number to be
	used for billing purposes.</t>
	

	<t>In this case, there exists a need for a way to pass 
	an additional billing
	identifier that can be used between network entities in order to
	correctly bill for services.  </t>
	<t>Several carriers, application providers, and equipment providers have been 
	using the P-Charge-Info header field since at least 2007 as a simple 
	mechanism to exchange this billing identifier.</t>
	
	<t>This document specifies the use of the P-Charge-Info header field in
    INVITE requests. The header field might be useful in other SIP
    messages, but such use is beyond the scope of this document.</t>

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
      "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as

    <section anchor="Purpose" title="Purpose of This Document">
    <t>This document has been prepared to document the existing deployed
    usage of the P-Charge-Info header field and to comply with Section 4 of  
    <xref target="RFC5727"/> in registering this header field with IANA.
    It is noted that RFC 5727 specifically 
    deprecates new usage of "P-" header fields, but P-Charge-Info has been in 
    deployment since before 2007 and predates RFC 5727. Given this, 
    the authors believe that P&#8209;Charge&#8209;Info is a "grandfathered
    case" per Section 4 of RFC 5727.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="UseCases" title="Use Cases">
    
    <t>The simplest use case for P-Charge-Info is an enterprise
    environment where each SIP endpoint has a direct number that is passed
    by the enterprise SIP proxy across to a SIP proxy at a SIP service
    provider who provides connectivity to the Public Switched Telephone
    Network (PSTN).  Rather than cause the SIP
    service provider to have to track each individual direct number for
    billing purposes, the enterprise SIP proxy sends, in the
    P-Charge-Info header field, a single billing identifier that the SIP service
    provider uses for billing purposes.</t>
   

      <t>As another example, a hosted 
      telephony provider or hosted voice-application provider may have a 
      large SIP network with customers who are distributed over a very large
      geographic area and use local-market PSTN numbers, although the network has only a very
      few actual PSTN interconnection points.</t>

      <t>The customers may all have local
      phone numbers, yet outgoing calls are actually routed across a
      SIP network and out specific PSTN gateways or across specific SIP
      connections to other SIP service providers. The hosted provider may want to
      pass a billing identifier to its SIP service providers either
      for the purpose of simplicity in billing or to obtain better rates
      from the SIP service providers.</t>

    <section anchor="P-Charge-Info" title="The P-Charge-Info Header">

       <section anchor="applicability" title="Applicability Statement for the P-Charge-Info Header Field">
          <t>The P-Charge-Info header field is applicable within a single private
	  administrative domain or between different administrative domains
	  where there is a trust relationship between the domains.</t>
       </section>

       <section anchor="usage" title="Usage of the P-Charge-Info Header Field">
         <t>The P-Charge-Info header field is used to convey information about
	 the identity of the party to be charged.  The P-Charge-Info header field
	 is typically inserted into a SIP request, usually an INVITE, by one of the following:<list
	 style="symbols">
	    <t>the SIP proxy on the originating network;</t>
	    <t>a PSTN gateway acting as a SIP UA; or</t>
	    <t>an application server generating billing information.</t>
	 </list></t>

              <t>P-Charge-Info is to be used by the SIP entity that
	      provides billing services for a session. This could be an
	      entity that is generating billing records or another entity interacting
	      with it. Upon receipt
	      of an INVITE request with the P-Charge-Info header field, such an
	      entity MAY use the value present in P-Charge-Info as
	      indicating the party responsible for the charges associated
	      with the session. This decision, for example, could be based on 
	      local policy.</t>
	      
            <section anchor="usage-ua" title="Procedures at the UA">
	      <t>The P-Charge-Info header field may be inserted by PSTN gateways
	      or application servers
	      acting as a SIP UA.</t>
	      <t>The P-Charge-Info header field is ignored by an end-user UA and
	      should not normally be received by such a UA.  It MUST NOT be
	      sent to an end-user UA, as this would provide information to the
	      UA about
	      the party to be charged; providing such information may cause
	      security-related issues; for example, calling-party information would
	      be known by the UA for an otherwise anonymous call. 
	      A UA SHOULD ignore it if it receives this header. Similarly, an
	      end-user 
	      UA originating a SIP message SHOULD NOT insert this header field.</t>


              <t>A PSTN gateway or application server acting as a UA MAY use the
content of the P-Charge-Info header field present in an INVITE
request it received as the identity to be charged for the session for
billing-related procedures, e.g., in a billing record or during interaction
with another entity generating billing records. A PSTN gateway or
	      application server acting as a UA MAY use the content of the
	      P-Charge-Info header field to populate information 
	      about the identity of the party to charge in another type of 
	      signaling, such as ISDN User Part (ISUP).</t>
	    </section>
	    <section anchor="usage-proxies" title="Procedures at the Proxy">
	    <t>A SIP proxy that supports this extension and receives a
	    request, typically a SIP INVITE, MAY insert a P-Charge-Info header field. The contents of the
	    inserted header field may be decided based on local policy or by
	    querying an external entity to determine the identity of the
	    party to be charged.</t>


            <t>When a proxy receives an INVITE request, it MAY use the content of the
P-Charge-Info header field contained in the request for billing-related
procedures, e.g., in a billing record or during interaction with
another entity that is generating billing records.</t>

	    <t>A SIP proxy that does not support this extension will pass
	    any received P-Charge-Info header field unmodified, in compliance with
	    RFC 3261.</t>
	    <t>A proxy supporting this extension MUST remove the
	    P-Charge-Info header field before sending a request to a UA that is
	    not acting as a PSTN gateway or appropriate application server, if the
	    role of the UA is known.</t>
	    </section>
       </section>

       <section anchor="example" title="Use-Case Example">
       <t>The content of the P-Charge-Info header field is typically just a SIP/tel 
       URI used as a billing indicator.  An example could be as simple as one of:</t>
       <t>P-Charge-Info: &lt;sip:+14075550134@example.net;user=phone&gt;</t>
       <t>P-Charge-Info: &lt;sip:+12345550167@example.com&gt;</t>
       <t>P-Charge-Info: &lt;sips:1234@example.com&gt;</t>
       <t>P-Charge-Info: &lt;tel:+14075551234&gt;</t>
       <t>Any other applicable SIP URI could be used.</t>

       <t>This RFC contains the definition of one or more SIP header fields
      that allow choosing between addr-spec and name-addr when
      constructing header-field values. <xref target="RFC8217"/> prohibits the
      use of addr-spec if its value would contain a comma, semicolon, or 
      question mark.</t>
      
       <t>The private header field specified here is described in
   both prose and an augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) defined in

   notation and contents of <xref target="RFC3261"/> and 
   <xref target="RFC5234"/> to understand this
   document.</t>
       <t>The syntax of the P-Charge-Info header field is described as follows:</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
       <section anchor="TrustRelationship" title="Trust Relationship">
       <t>Given that the information contained in the P-Charge-Info header field
       will be used for billing purposes, the proxies and other SIP entities
       that share this information MUST have a trust relationship.</t>
       <t>If an untrusted entity were inserted between the trusted
       entities, it could potentially interfere with the billing records
       for the call.  If the SIP connections are not made over a private
       network, a mechanism for securing the confidentiality and integrity of
       the SIP connection MUST be used to protect the information. One
       such mechanism could be TLS encryption of the SIP signaling stream.</t>
       </section>
       <section anchor="SecurityUntrustedPeers" title="Untrusted Peers">
       <section anchor="UntrustedPeersIngress" title="Ingress from Untrusted Peers">
       <t>If the P-Charge-Info header field was accepted by a SIP entity from an
       untrusted peer, there is the potential for fraud if the untrusted
       entity sent incorrect information, either inadvertently or
       maliciously.</t>
       <t>Therefore, a SIP entity MUST remove and ignore the P-Charge-Info
       header field when it is received from an untrusted entity.</t>
       </section>
       <section anchor="UntrustedPeersEgress" title="Egress to Untrusted Peers">
       <t>If the P-Charge-Info header field was sent by a SIP entity to an
       untrusted peer, there is potential for exposure of network
       information that is internal to a trust domain.  For instance, the
       untrusted entity may learn the identities of public SIP proxies used
       within the trust domain, which could then potentially be directly
       attacked.</t>
         <t>If an implementation does not strip P-Charge-Info from the message 
         where specified in this document, it introduces serious privacy risks. 
         Examples include revealing third-party billing relationships that might 
         be sensitive, as well as unmasking the identity of callers who wish to 
         remain anonymous. Depending on circumstances, the latter case may 
         result in unwanted harassment and even physical harm to the calling party.</t>
       <t>Therefore, a SIP entity MUST remove the P-Charge-Info
       header field when it is sent to an untrusted entity.</t>

      <section anchor="P-Charging-Vector" title="P-Charging-Vector">

        <t>P-Charging-Vector is defined in Section 4.6 of <xref target="RFC7315"/>
    and used by the 3GPP to carry information related to
	the charging of a session. There are, however, some differences 
	in the semantics associated with P-Charging-Vector and
	P-Charge-Info. P-Charging-Vector is mainly used to carry information for 
	correlation of multiple charging records generated for a single session. 
	On the other hand, P&#8209;Charge&#8209;Info is used to convey information about 
	the party to be billed for a call. Furthermore, P-Charging-Vector has 
	a mandatory icid-value parameter that is a globally unique value to 
	identify the session for which the charging information is generated. 
	Such a globally unique identifier is not necessary when carrying 
	information about the user to be billed when it is attached to the 
	corresponding session-related signaling.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="P-DCS-Billing-Info" title="P-DCS-Billing-Info">
      <t>P-DCS-Billing-Info is defined in Section 7 of <xref target="RFC5503"/>
      and used for passing billing information between trusted 
      entities in the PacketCable Distributed Call Signaling Architecture.
      For many billing situations, particularly the very large-scale
      residential telephone networks for which this header field is designed,
      P&#8209;DCS&#8209;Billing&#8209;Info is an excellent solution. However, this ability to
      address a range of situations adds complexity. According to RFC 5503,
      the following information is mandatory to include in each use of the 
      P-DCS-Billing-Info header field:
      <list style="symbols">
         <t>Billing-Correlation-ID, a globally unique identifier</t>
	 <t>Financial-Entity-ID</t>
	 <t>RKS-Group-ID (record-keeping server)</t>
      </list>
      The P-DCS-Billing-Info header field may also include a variety of additional parameters.</t>

      <t>While this may work well in many billing scenarios, there are
      other billing scenarios that do not need this level of
      complexity. In those simpler scenarios, all that is needed is a
      number to use for billing. P-Charge-Info provides this simple
      solution for simple billing scenarios.</t>

      <t>Additionally, according to Section 7.3 of RFC 5503, it is mandatory
      for a UA to create a
      Billing-Correlation-ID and insert this into the P-DCS-Billing-Info
      header field (along with the other required information) sent in the initial 
      SIP INVITE. This again makes sense for the residential-telephone-service
      environment for which this header field is designed. In contrast,
      P-Charge-Info is designed to be used among proxies and not at all by
      normal user agents. (P&#8209;Charge&#8209;Info may, though, be used by user agents
      associated with PSTN gateways.)</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="P-Asserted-Identity" title="P-Asserted-Identity">
      <t>Early reviewers of this document asked why the P-Asserted-Identity
      header field documented in <xref target="RFC3325"/> could not
      be used. As mentioned in the use-case example above,
      P-Asserted-Identity is used to indicate the identity of the calling
      party. However, in this instance, the requirement is to provide an
      additional identity of the SIP-to-PSTN interconnect point. </t>
      <t>It would be typical to find both P-Asserted-Identity and
      P&#8209;Charge&#8209;Info used in a SIP exchange. P-Asserted-Identity would be
      used to provide the caller identity that would be displayed to the
      end user as "Caller ID", while P-Charge-Info would provide the billing
      identifier used for the billing associated with the call.</t>
