    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Routing information is communicated to IPv6 hosts by Router
      Advertisement (RA) messages <xref target="RFC4861"/>. If these messages
      are sent too frequently, they can severely impact power consumption on
      battery-powered hosts.</t>

    <section title="Problem Scenarios">
      <section title="Solicited Multicast RAs on Large Networks">
        <t>On links with a large number of battery-powered devices, sending
	solicited multicast Router Advertisements can severely impact host
	power consumption. This is because every time a device joins the
	network, all devices on the network receive a multicast Router
	Advertisement. In the worst case, if devices are continually joining
	and leaving the network, and the network is large enough, then all
	devices on the network will receive solicited Router Advertisements at
	the maximum rate specified by section 6.2.6 of <xref
	target="RFC4861"/>, which is one every 3 seconds.</t> 
      </section>
      <section title="Frequent Periodic Router Advertisements">
        <t>Some networks send periodic multicast Router Advertisements very
	frequently (e.g., once every few seconds). This may be due to a desire
	to minimize customer impact of network renumbering events, which in
	some large residential networks occur relatively frequently. In the
	presence of hosts that ignore RAs or even all IPv6 packets when in
	sleep mode, such networks may see a need to send RAs frequently in
	order to avoid leaving devices with non-functional IPv6 configurations
	for extended periods of time. Unfortunately, this has severe impact on
	battery life.</t> 
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Consequences"> 
      <t>Observed effects of frequently sending Router Advertisement messages to
      battery-powered devices include:</t> 
      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>Some hosts simply experience bad battery life on these networks and
	otherwise operate normally. This is frustrating for users of these
	networks.</t> 
        <t>Some hosts react by dropping all Router Advertisement messages when
	in power-saving mode on any network, e.g., <eref
	target="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=32662"/>. This
	causes devices to lose connectivity when in power-saving mode,
	potentially disrupting background network communications, because the
	device is no longer able to send packets or acknowledge received
	traffic.</t> 
        <t>Some hosts react by dropping *all* IPv6 packets when in power-saving mode, <eref
	target="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/nsp/ipv6/54641"/>. This
	disrupts network communications.</t> 
        </list></t>
        <t>Compounding the problem, when dealing with devices that drop Router
	Advertisements when in power saving mode, some network administrators
	work around the problem by sending RAs even more frequently. This
	causes devices to engage in even more aggressive filtering.</t> 
    </section>


    <section title="Router Advertisement Frequency" anchor="sec_frequency">
      <t>The appropriate frequency of periodic RAs depends on how constrained
      the network devices are. 
        <list style="symbols"><t>Laptop-class devices will likely experience
	no noticeable battery-life impact, even if RAs are sent every few
	seconds.</t> 
          <t>Tablets, phones, and watches experience it more noticeably. At
	  the time of writing, current-generation devices might consume on the
	  order of 5 mA when the main processor is asleep. Upon receiving a
	  packet, they might consume on the order of 200 mA for 250 ms, as the
	  packet causes the main processor to wake up, process the RA, attend
	  to other pending tasks, and then go back to sleep. Thus, on
	  such devices, the cost of receiving one RA will be approximately
	  0.014 mAh. 
<vspace /><vspace />

In order to limit the amount of power used to receive Router Advertisements
to, say, 2% of idle power (i.e., to impact idle battery life by no more than
2%), the average power budget for receiving RAs must be no more than 0.1 mA, or
approximately 7 RAs per hour. Due to background multicast loss and the
tendency of current devices to rate-limit multicast when asleep, many of these
RAs might not reach the device. Thus, the minimum lifetimes for RA
configuration parameters such as default router lifetime might reasonably be
5-10 times the RA period, or roughly 45-90 minutes. 
<vspace /><vspace />

      An impact of 2% relative to measured idle current is negligible,
      since on this sort of device average power consumption
      is typically much higher than idle power consumption.
</t> 

          <t>Specialized devices in non-general-purpose networks such as
	  sensor networks might have tighter requirements. In these
	  environments, even longer RA intervals might be appropriate.</t> 
        </list>
      </t>

    <section title="Recommendations">
      <section title="Network-Side Recommendations">
        <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Router manufacturers SHOULD allow network administrators to
	  configure the routers to respond to Router Solicitations with
	  unicast Router Advertisements if: 
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>The Router Solicitation's source address is not the unspecified address, and:</t>
            <t>The solicitation contains a valid Source Link-Layer Address option.</t>
          </list></t>
          <t>Administrators of networks that serve large numbers (tens or
	  hundreds) of battery-powered devices SHOULD enable this
	  behavior.</t> 
          <t>Networks that serve battery-powered devices SHOULD NOT send
	  multicast RAs too frequently (see section <xref
	  target="sec_frequency"/>) unless the information in the RA packet
	  has substantially changed. If there is a desire to ensure that hosts
	  pick up configuration changes quickly, those networks MAY send
	  frequent Router Advertisements for a limited period of time (e.g.,
	  not more than one minute) immediately after a configuration
	  change.</t> 
        </list></t>
        <t>No protocol changes are required. Responding to Router
	Solicitations with unicast Router Advertisements is already allowed by
	section 6.2.6 of <xref target="RFC4861"/>, and Router Advertisement
	intervals are already configurable by the administrator to a wide
	range of values.</t> 

      </section>
      <section title="Device-Side Recommendations">
        <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Maintaining IPv6 connectivity requires that hosts be able to
	  receive periodic multicast RAs <xref target="RFC4861"/>. Therefore,
	  hosts that process unicast packets sent while they are asleep MUST
	  also process multicast RAs sent while they are
	  asleep. Battery-powered hosts MAY rate-limit identical RAs if they
	  are sent too frequently.</t> 
          <t>Battery-powered devices that do not intend to maintain IPv6
	  connectivity while asleep SHOULD either disconnect from the network,
	  abandoning all IPv6 configuration on that network, or perform
	  Detecting Network Attachment in IPv6 (DNAv6)
	  procedures <xref target="RFC6059"/> when waking up.</t> 
        </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Misconfigured or malicious hosts sending rogue Router Advertisements
      <xref target="RFC6104"/> can also severely impact power consumption on battery-powered
      hosts if they send a significant number of such messages. Any IPv6
      network where there is potential for misconfigured or malicious hosts
      should take appropriate countermeasures to mitigate the problem.
