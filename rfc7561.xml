      <t>
        This document provides guidelines for achieving end-to-end 
	Quality of Service (QoS) in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) domain 
	where the access network is based on IEEE 802.11. RFC 7222 
	describes QoS negotiation between a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) 
	and Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in a PMIPv6 mobility domain. 
	The negotiated QoS parameters can be used for QoS policing and 
	marking of packets to enforce QoS differentiation on the path 
	between the MAG and LMA. 

   IEEE 802.11 and Wi-Fi Multimedia - Admission Control (WMM-AC)
   describe methods for QoS negotiation between a Wi-Fi Station (MN in
   PMIPv6 terminology) and an Access Point.  This document 
	provides a mapping between the above two sets of QoS procedures 
	and the associated QoS parameters. This document is intended 
	to be used as a companion document to RFC 7222 to enable 
	implementation of end-to-end QoS.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>PMIPv6 QoS <xref target="RFC7222"/> describes an access-network-independent
	way to negotiate Quality of Service (QoS) for Proxy Mobile IPv6 
	(PMIPv6) mobility sessions. IEEE 802.11, Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM), and 
	Wi-Fi Multimedia - Admission Control (WMM-AC) describe ways to 
	provide QoS for Wi-Fi traffic between the Wi-Fi Station (STA) and 
	Access Point (AP). This document describes how QoS can be implemented 
	in a network where the access network is based on IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi). 
	It requires a mapping between QoS procedures and information 
	elements in two segments: 1) the Wi-Fi segment and 2) the PMIPv6 segment.
	(See <xref target="figure-1"/>.) The recommendations here allow for dynamic QoS 
	policy information per Mobile Node (MN) and session to be configured 
	by the IEEE 802.11 access network. PMIPv6 QoS signaling between the 
	Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) and Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) 
	provisions the per-MN QoS policies in the MAG. Further details 
	on policy configuration and the Policy Control Function (PCF) can be 
	found in <xref target="RFC7222"/>, Section 6.1. 
	In the IEEE 802.11 access network modeled here, the MAG is located 
	at the AP / Wireless LAN Controller (WLC). 
	<xref target="figure-1"/> below provides an overview of the 
	entities and protocols.

    <t>The MN and Access Point (AP) use IEEE 802.11 QoS mechanisms to set up QoS 
    flows in the Wi-Fi segment. The MAG and LMA set up QoS flows using PMIPv6 
    QoS procedures. The protocols and mechanisms between the AP and MAG are outside 
    the scope of this document. Some implementations may have the AP and MAG in 
    the same network node. However, this document does not exclude various 
    deployments including those in which the AP and WLC are separate nodes or in which the 
    MAG control and data planes are separate.
    </t>
    
    <t>The recommendations in this document use IEEE 802.11 QoS and PMIPv6 
    QoS mechanisms <xref target="RFC7222"/>. State machines for QoS policy 
    setup in IEEE 802.11 and PMIPv6 operate differently. Guidelines for 
    installing QoS in the MN using IEEE 802.11 and PMIPv6 segments and for mapping 
    parameters between them are outlined below.
    </t>
    
    <t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="4">
       <t hangText="- Procedure Mapping:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
       PMIPv6-defined procedures for QoS setup, as specified in <xref
       target="RFC7222"/>, may be triggered 
       by the LMA or MAG. IEEE 802.11 QoS setup, on the other hand, is always 
       triggered by the MN (IEEE 802.11 QoS Station (QSTA)). The end-to-end QoS setup 
       across these network segments should accommodate QoS that is triggered
       by the network or by the end user.
       </t>
       
       <t hangText="- Parameter Mapping:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
       There is no systematic method of mapping of specific parameters 
       between PMIPv6 QoS parameters and IEEE 802.11 QoS. 


For example, 
       parameters like Allocation and Retention Priority (AARP) in PMIPv6 QoS 
       have no equivalent in IEEE 802.11.
       </t>
    </list>
    </t>
    
    <t>The primary emphasis of this specification is to handle the 
    interworking between WMM-AC signaling/procedures and PMIPv6 QoS 
    signaling/procedures. When the client does not support WMM-AC, then 
    the AP/MAG uses the connection mapping in <xref target="table-2"/> and 
    DSCP-to-AC mapping as shown in <xref target="table-3"/>.
    </t>
    
    <t>The rest of the document is organized as follows. 
    <xref target="chapter-2"/> provides an overview of IEEE 802.11 QoS. 
    <xref target="chapter-3"/> describes a mapping of QoS signaling procedures 
    between IEEE 802.11 and PMIPv6.
    The mapping of parameters between IEEE 802.11 and PMIPv6 QoS is 
    described in <xref target="chapter-4"/>.

    <!-- chapter 2 *********************  -->
    <section anchor="chapter-2" title="Overview of IEEE 802.11 QoS">
    <t>IEEE 802.11 defines a way of 
    providing prioritized access for different traffic classes (video, voice, 
    etc.) by a mechanism called EDCA (Enhanced Distributed Channel Access).  



    The levels of priority in EDCA are called access categories (ACs) and 
    there are four levels (in decreasing order of priority): Voice, Video, 
    Best-Effort, and Background. 
    Prioritized access is achieved by using AC-specific 
    values for Contention Window (CW) and Arbitration Inter-Frame Space (AIFS). 
    (Higher-priority categories have smaller values for minimum and maximum 
    CW and AIFS.)
    </t>
    
    <t>A subset of the QoS mechanisms is defined in WMM -- a Wi-Fi Alliance 
    certification of support for a set of features from an IEEE 802.11e draft 
    (now part of IEEE 802.11).  This certification is for both clients and 
    APs and certifies the operation of WMM. WMM is primarily the 
    implementation of the EDCA component of IEEE 802.11e.  WMM uses the IEEE 802.1P 
    classification scheme developed by the IEEE (which is now a part of the 
    802.1D specification). The IEEE 802.1P classification scheme has eight 
    priorities, which WMM maps to four access categories: AC_BK, AC_BE, AC_VI, 
    and AC_VO. The lack of support in WMM for the TCLAS (used in identifying 
    an IP flow) has an impact on the QoS provisioning. The impact on WMM-based
    QoS provisioning is described 
    in Sections <xref target="chapter-3" format="counter"/> and <xref target="chapter-4" format="counter"/>.
    </t>
    
    <t>IEEE 802.11 defines the way a (non-AP) STA can request QoS to be 
    reserved for an access category. Correspondingly, the AP can determine 
    whether to admit or deny the request depending on the available resources.  


    Further, the AP may require that Admission Control is mandatory for an 
    access category. In such a case, the STA is expected to use the access category only 
    after being successfully admitted. WMM-AC is a Wi-Fi Alliance certification 
    of support for Admission Control based on a set of features in IEEE 802.11.
    </t>
    
    <t>The QoS signaling in IEEE 802.11 is initiated by the (non-AP) 
    STA (by sending an ADDTS request). This specification references procedures 
    in IEEE 802.11, WMM, and WMM-AC.

    <section anchor="chapter-3" title="Mapping QoS Procedures between IEEE 802.11 and PMIPv6">

    <t>There are two main types of interaction possible to provision QoS 
    for flows that require Admission Control -- one where the MN initiates 
    the QoS request and the network provisions the resources. The second is 
    where the network provisions resources as a result of a PMIPv6 QoS request. 
    In the second scenario, the LMA can push the QoS configuration to the MAG. 
    However, there is no standard way for the AP to initiate a 
    QoS service request to the MN. Recommendations to set up QoS in both these 
    cases are described in this section.

    <t>This procedure outlines the case where the MN is configured to start 
    the QoS signaling. In this case, the MN sends an ADDTS request indicating 
    the QoS required for the flow.


   The AP/MAG obtains the corresponding level 
   of QoS to be granted to the flow by using the PMIPv6 PBU/PBA sequence 
   that contains the QoS options exchanged with the LMA. 
 Details of the QoS provisioning for the 
    flow are provided below.

       It should be noted that WMM-AC specifications do not contain TCLAS.  
       When TCLAS is not present, there is no direct way to derive flow-specific attributes like Traffic Selector in PMIPv6. 
       In this case, functionality to derive IP flow details from information 
       in upper-layer protocols (e.g., SIP <xref target="RFC3261"/>) and 
       associate them with a subsequent QoS request may be used. 
       This is not described further here, but it 
       may be functionality in an Application Layer Gateway (ALG) or 
       Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). 
       It should be noted that an ALG or DPI can increase the complexity of 
       the AP/MAG implementation and affect its scalability. 

       If no TCLAS is derived, the reservation applies to all flows of the 
       MN. Parameter mapping in this case is shown in 
       <xref target="table-2"/>.
       </t>

       <t hangText="(2)">If there are sufficient resources at the AP/WLC to 
       satisfy the request, the MAG sends a PBU with QoS options, Operational 
       Code ALLOCATE, and the Traffic Selector identifying the flow. 
       The Traffic Selector is derived from the TCLAS to identify the 
       flow requesting QoS. IEEE 802.11 QoS parameters in TSPEC are mapped 
       to PMIPv6 parameters. The mapping of TCLAS to PMIPv6 is shown in <xref target="table-1"/>. 
       TSPEC parameter mapping is shown in <xref target="table-4"/>.
       <vspace blankLines="1"/>
       If TCLAS is not present (when WMM-AC is used), TCLAS may be derived from 
       information in upper-layer protocols (as described in step 1) 
       and populated in the Traffic Selector. If TCLAS cannot be derived, the 
       Traffic Selector field is not included in the QoS options.

       Reserved bandwidth for flows is calculated separately from the

       The Traffic Selector identifies the flow for which the QoS 
       reservations are made.
       <vspace blankLines="1"/>
       If the LMA offers downgraded QoS values to the MAG, it should send a 
       PBU to the LMA with Operational Code set to DE-ALLOCATE. (The LMA would 
       respond with PBA to confirm completion of the request.)
       </t>
       <t hangText="(4)">The AP/MAG provisions the corresponding QoS and

       The AP polices these flows according to the QoS provisioning.
       <vspace blankLines="1"/>
       In step 3, if the LMA sends a downgraded QoS or a PBA message with 
       status code CANNOT_MEET_QOS_SERVICE_REQUEST (179), then the AP should 
       respond to the MN with ADDTS Response and ResultCode set as follows:
	  <list style="hanging" hangIndent="3">
	  <t hangText="-">for downgraded QoS from LMA, ResultCode is set to  
	  REJECTED_WITH_SUGGESTED_CHANGES. Downgraded QoS values from LMA are 
	  mapped to TSPEC as per <xref target="table-4"/>. 
	  This is still a rejection, but the MN may revise the QoS to a lower 
	  level and repeat this sequence if the application can adapt.

	  <t hangText="-">if LMA cannot meet the QoS service request, 
	  ResultCode is set to TCLAS_RESOURCES_EXHAUSTED.

	  </list>
       <vspace blankLines="1"/>
       Either REJECTED_WITH_SUGGESTED_CHANGES or TCLAS_RESOURCES_EXHAUSTED results 
       in the rejection of the QoS reservation, but it does not cause the removal

    <section anchor="chapter-3.2.1" title="LMA-Initiated QoS Reservation Request">
    <t>This section describes the case when the QoS service request is 
    initiated by the LMA. For example, an application such as voice may 
    request the network to initiate configuration of additional QoS policy 
    as in <xref target="TS23.203"/>, Section 7.4.2. In the current WLAN 
    specifications, there is no standard-defined way for the AP to initiate 
    a QoS service request to the MN. As a result, when the MAG receives a 
    QoS request from the LMA, it does not have any standard mechanisms to 
    initiate any QoS requests to the MN over the access network.  
    Given this, the PMIPv6 QoS service requests and any potential WLAN 
    service requests (such as described in <xref target="chapter-3.1"/>) 
    are handled asynchronously.
    </t>
    
    <t>The PMIPv6 QoS service requests and WLAN QoS service request could 
    still be coordinated to provide an end-to-end QoS. 
    If the MAG receives an Update Notification (UPN) request from the LMA to reserve QoS resources 
    for which it has no corresponding QoS request from the MN, the MAG may, in 
    consultation with the AP, provision a policy that can grant a subsequent 
    QoS request from the MN. 
    If the MN initiates QoS procedures after the completion of PMIPv6 QoS 
    procedures, the AP/MAG can ensure consistency between the QoS resources 
    in the access network and QoS resources between the MAG and LMA.
    </t>
    
    <t>For example, if the MN is requesting a mean data rate of x Mbps, 
    the AP and MAG can ensure that the rate can be supported on the network 
    between MAG and LMA based on previous PMIPv6 QoS procedures. 
    If the MN subsequently requests data rates of x Mbps or less, 
    the AP can accept a request based on the earlier PMIPv6 QoS provisioning. 
    For the case where there is a mismatch, i.e., the network does not 
    support the x Mbps, then either the MAG should renegotiate the QoS 
    resource and ask for increased QoS resources or the AP should reject 
    the QoS request.

    <t>The network-initiated QoS service request scenario poses some 
    challenges outlined here. IEEE 802.11 does not provide any mechanisms 
    for the AP to initiate a QoS request. 
    As a result, the AP/MAG cannot explicitly make any reservations in 
    response to a QoS reservation request made using UPN. IEEE 802.11aa 
    <xref target="IEEE-802.11aa"/> (which is an amendment to IEEE 802.11) 
    has a mechanism that enables the AP to ask the client to reserve QoS 
    for a traffic stream. 
    It does this via the ADDTS Reserve Request. The ADDTS Reserve Request 
    contains a TSPEC, an optional TCLAS, and a mandatory stream identifier. 
    The specification does not describe how the AP would obtain such a stream 
    identifier. As a result, there needs to be a new higher-layer protocol 
    defined that is understood by the MN and AP and that provides a common stream 
    identifier to both ends. Alternately, the IEEE 802.11aa specification could 
    be modified to make the usage optional. 
    When (or if) the stream identifier is made optional, the TCLAS can provide 
    information about the traffic stream.

    <t>The MN tags all data packets with DSCP and IEEE 802.1D UP corresponding 
    to the application and the subscribed policy or authorization. 
    The AP polices sessions and flows based on the configured QoS policy 
    values for the MN.
    </t>
    <t>For QoS reservations, TSPEC uses WMM-AC values and PMIPv6 QoS uses 
    corresponding DSCP values in Traffic Class (TC). 
    IEEE 802.11 QoS Access Category AC_VO and AC_VI are used for QoS reservations. 
    AC_BE and AC_BK should not be used in reservations.
    </t>
    <t>When WMM-AC specifications that do not contain TCLAS are used, 
    it is only possible to have one reservation per Traffic Class / 
    access category. PMIPv6 QoS will not contain any flow-specific 
    attributes like Traffic Selector.

    <t>In PMIPv6 QoS <xref target="RFC7222"/>, services using a sending rate 
    smaller than or equal to the Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) can assume, in general,
    that congestion-related packet drops will not occur 
    <xref target="TS23.203"/>. 
    If the rate offered by the service exceeds this threshold, there are 
    no guarantees provided. 
    IEEE 802.11 radio networks do not offer such a guarantee, but 
    <xref target="WMM-1.2.0"/> notes that the application (service) 
    requirements are captured in TSPEC by the MSDU (MAC Service Data Unit) 
    and Mean Data Rate. The TSPEC should contain Mean Data Rate, and it is 
    recommended that it be mapped to the GBR parameters, 
    Guaranteed-DL-Bit-Rate and Guaranteed-UL-Bit-Rate in PMIPv6 QoS 
    <xref target="RFC7222"/>.
    </t>
    
    <t>IEEE 802.11 TSPEC requests do not require all fields to be completed. 
    <xref target="WMM-1.2.0"/> specifies a list of TSPEC parameters that are 
    required in the specification. 
    Peak Data Rate is not required in WMM; however, for MNs and APs that are 
    capable of specifying the Peak Data Rate, it should be mapped to 
    MBR (Maximum Bit Rate) in PMIPv6 QoS. 
    The AP should use the MBR parameters Aggregate-Max-DL-Bit-Rate and 
    Aggregate-Max-UL-Bit-Rate to police these flows on the backhaul segment 
    between MAG and LMA.
    </t>
    
    <t>During the QoS reservation procedure, if the MN requests Mean Data Rate,
    or Peak Data Rate in excess of values authorized in PMIPv6 QoS, 
    the AP should deny the request in an ADDTS response. 
    The AP may set the reject cause code to REJECTED_WITH_SUGGESTED_CHANGES 
    and send a revised TSPEC with Mean Data Rate and Peak Data Rate set to 
    acceptable GBR and MBR, respectively, in PMIPv6 QoS.

    <section anchor="chapter-5" title="Security Considerations">
    <t>This document describes mapping of PMIPv6 QoS parameters to 
    IEEE 802.11 QoS parameters. 
    Thus, the security in the WLAN and PMIPv6 signaling segments and the 
    functional entities that map the two protocols need to be considered. 
    IEEE 802.11 <xref target="IEEE-802.11"/> provides the means to secure 
    management frames that are used for ADDTS and DELTS. 
    The PMIPv6 specification <xref target="RFC5213"/> recommends using IPsec 
    and IKEv2 to secure protocol messages. 
    The security of the node(s) that implement the QoS mapping functionality 
    should be considered in actual deployments.
    </t>
    <t>The QoS mappings themselves do not introduce additional security 
    concerns.
