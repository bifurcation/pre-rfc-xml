      been redefined as a 6-bit DS field with 2 bits reserved, later
      claimed by Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) <xref target="RFC3168" />.  For
      the purpose of this specification, the (K)Start DS field is 8 bits 
      long, where the 6 most significant bits indicate the DS field to 
      be matched and the 2 least significant bits' values MUST be ignored 
      in any comparison. </t>
