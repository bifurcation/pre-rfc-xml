        <t> 
This document discusses the algorithmic translation of an IPv6 address to a corresponding 
IPv4 address, and vice versa, using only statically configured information. It defines a
well-known prefix for use in algorithmic translations, while allowing
organizations to also use network-specific prefixes when appropriate. 
Algorithmic translation is used in IPv4/IPv6 translators, as well
as other types of proxies and gateways (e.g., for DNS) used in IPv4/IPv6 scenarios.

<section title="Introduction">
<t> 
This document is part of a series of IPv4/IPv6 translation
documents.  A framework for IPv4/IPv6 translation is discussed in
<xref target="v4v6-FRAMEWORK"/>, including
a taxonomy of scenarios that will be used in this document.
Other documents specify the behavior of various types
of translators and gateways, including mechanisms for translating
between IP headers and other types of messages that include
IP addresses.  This document specifies how an individual
IPv6 address is translated to a corresponding IPv4 address,
and vice versa, in cases where an algorithmic mapping is
used.  While specific types of devices are used herein as examples,
it is the responsibility of the specification of such devices
to reference this document for algorithmic mapping of the addresses
themselves.
</t>
<t>
<xref target="addressAndFormat" /> describes the prefixes and the format of "IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses",
i.e., IPv6 addresses in which 32 bits contain an IPv4 address. This format is common to both 
"IPv4-converted" and "IPv4-translatable" IPv6 addresses. This section also defines the algorithms
for translating addresses, and the text representation of IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses.
</t>
<t>
<xref target="choices" /> discusses the choice of prefixes, 
the conditions in which they can be used, and the use of IPv4-embedded 
IPv6 addresses with stateless and stateful translation.
</t>
<t>
<xref target="designChoices" /> provides a summary of the discussions behind two specific design 
decisions, the choice of a null suffix and the specific value of the selected prefix.
</t>
<t>
<xref target="security" /> discusses security concerns.
</t>
<t>
In some scenarios, a dual-stack host will unnecessarily
send its traffic through an IPv6/IPv4 translator.  This can
be caused by the host's default address selection algorithm
<xref target="RFC3484"/>, referrals, or other reasons.  Optimizing these
scenarios for dual-stack hosts is for future study.
</t>
<section title="Applicability Scope">
<t>
This document is part of a series defining address translation services. We understand that 
the address format could also be used by other interconnection methods between IPv6 and IPv4,
e.g., methods based on encapsulation. If encapsulation methods are developed by the IETF,
we expect that their descriptions will document their specific use of IPv4-embedded
IPv6 addresses.

<section title="Conventions">
<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

<t>In these addresses, the prefix shall be either the "Well-Known Prefix"
or a "Network-Specific Prefix" unique to the organization deploying the 
address translators. The prefixes can only have one of the following lengths: 
32, 40, 48, 56, 64, or 96.  (The Well-Known Prefix is 96 bits long, and can only 
be used in the last form of the table.)
</t>
<t>
Various deployments justify different prefix lengths with Network-Specific 
Prefixes. The trade-off between 
different prefix lengths are discussed in Sections <xref target="stateless" format="counter" /> and 
<xref target="stateful" format="counter"/>. 
</t>
<t>
Bits 64 to 71 of the address are reserved for compatibility with the host identifier 
format defined in the IPv6 addressing architecture <xref target="RFC4291" />. 
These bits MUST be set to zero. When using a /96 Network-Specific Prefix, 
the administrators MUST ensure that the bits 64 to 71 are set to zero. 
A simple way to achieve that is to construct the /96 Network-Specific Prefix by 
picking a /64 prefix, and then adding 4 octets set to zero.
</t>
<t>
The IPv4 address is encoded following the prefix, most significant bits first. 
Depending of the prefix length, the 4 octets of the address may be separated by the 
reserved octet "u", whose 8 bits MUST be set to zero. In particular:</t>
<list style='symbols'>
<t>When the prefix is 32 bits long, the IPv4 address is encoded in positions 32 to 63.</t>
<t>When the prefix is 40 bits long, 24 bits of the IPv4 address are encoded 
in positions 40 to 63, with the remaining 8 bits in position 72 to 79.</t>
<t>When the prefix is 48 bits long, 16 bits of the IPv4 address are encoded in positions 
48 to 63, with the remaining 16 bits in position 72 to 87.</t>
<t>When the prefix is 56 bits long, 8 bits of the IPv4 address are encoded in positions 
56 to 63, with the remaining 24 bits in position 72 to 95.</t>
<t>When the prefix is 64 bits long, the IPv4 address is encoded in positions 72 to 103.</t>
<t>When the prefix is 96 bits long, the IPv4 address is encoded in positions 96 to 127.</t>
</list>
<t>
There are no remaining bits, and thus no suffix, if the prefix is 96 bits long. 
In the other cases, the remaining bits of the address constitute the suffix. 
These bits are reserved for future extensions and SHOULD be set to zero. 
Address translators who receive IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses where these bits
are not zero SHOULD ignore the bits' value and proceed as if the bits' value  
were zero. (Future extensions may specify a different behavior.)
</t>
</section>
<section title="Address Translation Algorithms" anchor="algorithm">
<t>
IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses are composed according to the following algorithm:
</t>
<list style='symbols'>
<t>
Concatenate the prefix, the 32 bits of the IPv4 address, and the suffix 
(if needed) to obtain a 128-bit address.
</t>
<t>
If the prefix length is less than 96 bits, insert the null octet
"u" at the appropriate position (bits 64 to 71), thus causing the least significant
octet to be excluded, as documented in <xref target="addressFigure" />.
</t>
</list>
<t>
The IPv4 addresses are extracted from the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses 
according to the following algorithm:
</t>
<list style='symbols'>
<t>
If the prefix is 96 bits long, extract the last 32 bits of the IPv6 address;
</t>
<t>
For the other prefix lengths, remove the "u" octet to obtain a 120-bit sequence 
(effectively shifting bits 72-127 to positions 64-119), 
then extract the 32 bits following the prefix.
</t>
</list>
</section>
<section title="Text Representation" anchor="textRep">
<t>
IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses will be represented in text in conformity with 
Section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC4291" />. IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses constructed 
using the Well-Known 
Prefix or a /96 Network-Specific Prefix may be represented using the alternative form presented in  
Section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC4291" />, with the embedded IPv4 address represented in
dotted decimal notation. Examples of such representations are presented in

</t>
</section>
</section>
<section title="Deployment Guidelines" anchor="choices">
<section title="Restrictions on the Use of the Well-Known Prefix" anchor="wpfUsage">
<t>
The Well-Known Prefix MUST NOT be used to represent non-global IPv4 addresses, such as 
those defined in <xref target="RFC1918"/> or listed 
in Section 3 of <xref target="RFC5735"/>. Address translators MUST NOT
translate packets in which an address is composed of 
the Well-Known Prefix and a non-global IPv4 address; they MUST drop these packets.
</t>
<t>
The Well-Known Prefix SHOULD NOT be used to construct IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses.
The nodes served by IPv4-translatable IPv6 
addresses should be able to receive global IPv6 traffic 
bound to their IPv4-translatable IPv6 address 
without incurring intermediate protocol translation. 
This is only possible if the specific prefix used to build the 
IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses 
is advertised in inter-domain routing, but the advertisement of  
more specific prefixes derived from the Well-Known Prefix
is not supported, as explained in <xref target="routing" />.
Network-Specific Prefixes SHOULD be used in these scenarios, as explained in
<xref target="stateless" />.
<t>
The Well-Known Prefix MAY be used by organizations deploying translation services,
as explained in <xref target="stateful" />.
</t>
</t>
</section>
<section title="Impact on Inter-Domain Routing" anchor="routing">
<t>
The Well-Known Prefix MAY appear in inter-domain routing tables, if service 
providers decide to provide IPv6-IPv4 interconnection services to peers. 
Advertisement of the Well-Known Prefix SHOULD be controlled either by upstream 
and/or downstream service providers according to inter-domain routing policies, e.g., 
through configuration of BGP <xref target="RFC4271"/>. 
Organizations that advertise the 
Well-Known Prefix in inter-domain routing MUST be able to provide IPv4/IPv6 translation service. 
</t>
<t>
When the IPv4/IPv6 translation relies on the Well-Known Prefix, 
IPv4-embedded IPv6 prefixes longer than the Well-Known Prefix MUST NOT be advertised 
in BGP (especially External BGP) <xref target="RFC4271"/> because this leads to importing 
the IPv4 routing table 
into the IPv6 one and therefore introduces scalability issues to the global IPv6 
routing table. Administrators of BGP nodes SHOULD configure filters that
discard advertisements of embedded 
IPv6 prefixes longer than the Well-Known Prefix.
</t>
<t>
When the IPv4/IPv6 translation service relies on Network-Specific
Prefixes, the IPv4-translatable IPv6 prefixes used in stateless translation MUST 
be advertised with proper aggregation to the IPv6 Internet. 
Similarly, if translators are configured with multiple
Network-Specific Prefixes, these prefixes MUST be advertised to the
IPv6 Internet with proper aggregation.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Choice of Prefix for Stateless Translation Deployments"
anchor="stateless">
<t>
Organizations may deploy translation services using stateless translation. In these 
deployments, internal IPv6 nodes are addressed using IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses, 
which enable them to be accessed by IPv4 nodes. The addresses of these external IPv4
nodes are then represented in IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses.
</t>
<t>
Organizations deploying stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation SHOULD 
assign a Network-Specific Prefix to their IPv4/IPv6 translation service. 
IPv4-translatable and IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses
MUST be constructed as specified in <xref target="addressFormat" />.
IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses MUST use the selected Network-Specific Prefix. 
Both IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses and IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses 
SHOULD use the same prefix.
</t>
<t>
Using the same prefix ensures that IPv6 nodes internal to the organization
will use the most efficient paths to reach the nodes served by 
IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses. Specifically, if a node 
learns the IPv4 address of a target internal node without knowing that this target
is in fact located behind the same translator that the node also uses, translation 
rules will ensure that the
IPv6 address constructed with the Network-Specific Prefix is the same as 
the IPv4-translatable IPv6 address assigned to the target. Standard routing 
preference (i.e., "most specific match wins") 
will then ensure that the IPv6 packets are delivered directly, without 
requiring that translators receive the packets and then return them
in the direction from which they came. 
</t>
<t>
The intra-domain routing protocol must be able to deliver packets to the nodes served by 
IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses. This may require routing on some or all of the embedded 
IPv4 address bits. Security considerations detailed in <xref target="security" /> require 
that routers check the validity of the IPv4-translatable IPv6 source addresses, using 
some form of reverse path check.
</t>
<t>
The management of stateless address translation 
can be illustrated with a small example:
</t>
<list>
<t/>
<t>
We will consider an IPv6 network
with the prefix 2001:db8:122::/48. The network administrator has selected the Network-Specific 
Prefix 2001:db8:122:344::/64 for managing stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation. 
The IPv4-translatable address block for IPv4 subnet 192.0.2.0/24 is 
2001:db8:122:344:c0:2::/96. In this network, the host A is assigned the
IPv4-translatable IPv6 address 2001:db8:122:344:c0:2:2100::, which corresponds to the 
IPv4 address 192.0.2.33. Host A's address is configured either manually or through DHCPv6.
</t>
<t/>
<t>
In this example, host A is not directly connected to the translator, but instead to 
a link managed by a router R. &nbsp;The router R is configured to forward to A the packets 
bound to 2001:db8:122:344:c0:2:2100::. To receive these packets, R will advertise 
reachability of the prefix 2001:db8:122:344:c0:2:2100::/104 in the intra-domain 
routing protocol -- or perhaps a shorter prefix if many hosts on link have 
IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses derived from the same IPv4 subnet. If a packet bound to 
192.0.2.33 reaches the translator, the destination 
address will be translated to 2001:db8:122:344:c0:2:2100::, and the packet will be routed
towards R and then to A.
</t>
<t/>
<t>
Let's suppose now that a host B
of the same domain learns the IPv4 address of A, maybe
through an application-specific referral. If B has translation-aware software, 
B can compose a destination address by combining
the Network-Specific Prefix 2001:db8:122:344::/64 and the IPv4 address 192.0.2.33,
resulting in the address 2001:db8:122:344:c0:2:2100::. The packet sent by B will
be forwarded towards R, and then to A, avoiding protocol translation.
</t>
<t/>
</list>
<t>
Forwarding, and reverse path checks, are more efficient when performed on the combination 
of the prefix 
and the IPv4 address. In theory, routers are able to route on prefixes of any length, but
in practice there may be routers for which routing on prefixes larger than 64 bits is slower. 
However, routing efficiency is not the only consideration 
in the choice of a prefix length. Organizations also need to consider the availability of 
prefixes, and the potential impact of all-zero identifiers.
</t>
<t>
If a /32 prefix is used, all the routing bits are contained in the top 64 bits of the IPv6 
address, leading to excellent routing properties. These prefixes may however be hard to obtain, 
and allocation of a /32 to a small set of 
IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses may be seen as wasteful. 
In addition, the /32 prefix and a zero suffix lead to an all-zero
interface identifier, which is an issue that we discuss in <xref target="suffixDiscuss" />.
</t>
<t>
Intermediate prefix lengths such as 
/40, /48, or /56 appear as compromises. Only some of 
the IPv4 bits are part of the /64 prefixes. Reverse path checks, in particular, 
may have a limited efficiency. 
Reverse path checks limited to the most significant bits of the IPv4 address will 
reduce the possibility 
of spoofing external IPv4 addresses, but would allow IPv6 nodes to spoof 
internal IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses.
</t>
<t>
We propose a compromise, based on using no more than 1/256th of an 
organization's allocation of IPv6 addresses for the IPv4/IPv6 translation service. 
For example, if the organization is an Internet Service Provider
with an allocated IPv6 prefix /32 or 
shorter, the ISP could dedicate a /40 prefix to the translation service. 
An end site with a /48 allocation could dedicate a /56 prefix to the translation 
service, or possibly a /96 prefix if all IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses
are located on the same link. 
</t>
<t>
The recommended prefix length is also a function of the deployment scenario.
The stateless translation can be used for Scenario 1, Scenario 2, Scenario 5,
and Scenario 6 defined in <xref target="v4v6-FRAMEWORK" />. 
For different scenarios, the prefix length recommendations are:</t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>  
For Scenario 1 (an IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet) and Scenario 2 
(the IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 network), 
an ISP holding a /32 allocation SHOULD use a /40 prefix, 
and a site holding a /48 allocation SHOULD use a /56 prefix.
</t>
<t>
For Scenario 5 (an IPv6 network to an IPv4 network) and Scenario 6 
(an IPv4 network to an IPv6 network), the deployment
SHOULD use a /64 or a /96 prefix.
</t>
</list>
We do not have enough experience with the technology to make stronger 
recommendations. Organizations MAY use alternative prefix lengths,
but SHOULD only do so after thorough review of routing and security implications.
</section>
<section title="Choice of Prefix for Stateful Translation Deployments" anchor="stateful">
<t>
Organizations may deploy translation services based on stateful 
translation technology. An organization may decide to use either a 
Network-Specific Prefix or the Well-Known Prefix 
for its stateful IPv4/IPv6 translation service.
</t>
<t>
When these services are used, IPv6 nodes are addressed through standard IPv6 
addresses, while IPv4 nodes are represented by IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses, as 
specified in <xref target="addressFormat" />.
</t>
<t>
The stateful nature of the translation creates a potential stability issue 
when the organization 
deploys multiple translators. If several translators use the same prefix, 
there is a risk that 
packets belonging to the same connection may be routed to different 
translators as the internal 
routing state changes. This issue can be avoided either by assigning 
different prefixes to 
different translators or by ensuring that all translators using the same 
prefix coordinate their state.
</t>
<t>
Stateful translation can be used in scenarios defined in 
<xref target="v4v6-FRAMEWORK"/>. The Well-Known Prefix SHOULD be used
in these scenarios, with two exceptions:
</t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
In all scenarios, the translation MAY use a Network-Specific Prefix, if deemed 
appropriate for management reasons. 
</t>
<t>
The Well-Known Prefix MUST NOT be used for Scenario 3 (the IPv6 Internet to an 
IPv4 network), as this would lead to using the Well-Known Prefix with non-global 
IPv4 addresses. That means a Network-Specific Prefix (for example, a /96 prefix) MUST be used in that scenario.
</t>
</list>
</section>
</section>
<section title="Design Choices" anchor="designChoices">
<t>
The prefix that we have chosen reflects two design choices, the null suffix and the specific value of the Well-Known Prefix. We provide here a summary of the discussions leading to those two choices.
</t>
<section title="Choice of Suffix" anchor="suffixDiscuss">
<t>
The address format described in <xref target="addressFormat" /> recommends a zero suffix. 
Before making this recommendation,
we considered different options: checksum neutrality, the encoding of a port range, 
and a value different than 0.
</t>
<t>
In the case of stateless translation, there would be no need for the translator
to recompute a one's complement checksum if both the IPv4-translatable and the 
IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses were constructed in a "checksum-neutral" manner, that is, if the 
IPv6 addresses would have the same one's complement checksum as the embedded IPv4
address. In the case of stateful translation, checksum neutrality does not eliminate checksum 
computation during translation, as only one of the two addresses would be checksum neutral.
We considered reserving 16 bits in the suffix to guarantee checksum neutrality,
but declined because it would not help with stateful translation and because checksum neutrality 
can also be achieved by an appropriate choice of the Network-Specific Prefix, i.e., selecting a prefix
whose one's complement checksum equals either 0 or 0xffff.
</t> 
<t>
There have been proposals to complement stateless translation with a port-range feature. 
Instead of mapping an IPv4 address to exactly one IPv6 prefix, the options would allow 
several IPv6 nodes to share an IPv4 address, with each node managing a different range 
of ports. If a port 
range extension is needed, it could be defined later, using bits currently reserved as null 
in the suffix.
</t>
<t>
When a /32 prefix is used, an all-zero suffix results in an
all-zero interface identifier. 
We understand the conflict with Section 2.6.1 of RFC4291, which specifies 
that all zeroes are used for the subnet-router anycast address. However, 
in our specification, there is only one node with an IPv4-translatable 
IPv6 address in 
the /64 subnet, so the anycast semantic does not create confusion. We 
thus decided to keep the null suffix for now. 
This issue does not exist for prefixes larger than 32 bits, such as the /40, 
/56, /64, and /96 prefixes that we recommend in <xref target="stateless" />.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Choice of the Well-Known Prefix" anchor="wpfDiscuss">
<t>
Before making our recommendation of the Well-Known Prefix, we were 
faced with three choices: 
</t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
reuse the IPv4-mapped prefix, ::ffff:0:0/96, as specified in RFC 2765, Section 2.1; 
</t>
<t>
request IANA to allocate a /32 prefix, or
</t>
<t>
request allocation of a new /96 prefix. 
</t>
</list>
<t>
We weighted the pros and cons of these choices before settling on the recommended 
/96 Well-Known Prefix.
</t>
<t>
The main advantage of the existing IPv4-mapped prefix is that it is already defined.
Reusing that prefix would require minimal standardization efforts. However, being 
already defined is not just an advantage, as there may be side effects of current 
implementations. When presented with the IPv4-mapped prefix, current versions of
Windows and Mac OS generate IPv4 packets, but will not send IPv6 packets. If 
we used the IPv4-mapped prefix, these nodes would not be able to support translation
without modification. This will defeat the main purpose of the translation techniques.
We thus eliminated the first choice, i.e., decided to not reuse 
the IPv4-mapped prefix, ::ffff:0:0/96.
</t>
<t>
A /32 prefix would have allowed the embedded 
IPv4 address to fit within the top 64 bits of the IPv6 address. This would have
facilitated routing and load balancing when an organization deploys several 
translators. However, such destination-address-based load balancing may not 
be desirable. It is not compatible with Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) <xref target="RFC5389"/> in the deployments 
involving 
multiple stateful translators, each one having a different pool of IPv4 addresses. 
STUN compatibility would only be achieved if the translators managed the same pool 
of IPv4 addresses and were able to coordinate their translation state, in which
case there is no big advantage to using a /32 prefix rather than a /96 prefix.
</t>
<t> 
According to Section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC4291"/>, in the legal 
textual representations of IPv6 addresses, dotted 
decimal can only appear at the end. The /96 prefix is compatible with that
requirement. It enables the dotted 
decimal notation without requiring an update to <xref target="RFC4291"/>. This 
representation makes the address format easier to use and the log files easier to read.
</t>
<t> 
The prefix that we recommend has the particularity of being "checksum neutral". 
The sum of the hexadecimal numbers "0064" and "ff9b" is "ffff", i.e., a value equal
to zero in one's complement arithmetic. An IPv4-embedded IPv6 address constructed with this
prefix will have the same one's complement checksum as the embedded IPv4 address. 
</t>
</section>
</section>
<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
<section title="Protection against Spoofing">
<t>
IPv4/IPv6 translators can be modeled as special routers, are subject to the same risks, 
and can implement the same mitigations. (The discussion of generic threats to routers 
and their mitigations is beyond the scope of this document.)
There is, however, a particular risk that directly derives 
from the practice of embedding IPv4 addresses in IPv6: address spoofing.
</t>
<t>
An attacker could use an IPv4-embedded IPv6 address as the source address of malicious packets. 
After translation, the packets will appear as IPv4 packets from the specified source, and 
the attacker may be hard to track. If left without mitigation, the attack would allow 
malicious IPv6 nodes to spoof arbitrary IPv4 addresses.
</t>
<t>
The mitigation is to implement reverse path checks and to verify throughout the network 
that packets are coming from an authorized location. 
</t>
</section>

<section title="Secure Configuration">
<t> 
The prefixes used for address translation are used
by IPv6 nodes to send packets to IPv6/IPv4 translators.
Attackers could attempt to fool nodes, DNS gateways, and IPv4/IPv6 
translators into using wrong values for these parameters, resulting in 
network disruption, denial of service, and possible information 
disclosure. To mitigate such attacks, network administrators need to 
ensure that prefixes are configured in a secure way.
</t>
<t>
The mechanisms for achieving secure configuration of prefixes are 
beyond the scope of this document.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Firewall Configuration">
<t> 
Many firewalls and other security devices filter traffic based on IPv4 addresses.
Attackers could attempt to fool these firewalls by sending IPv6 packets to or from IPv6 addresses 
that translate to the filtered IPv4 addresses. If the attack is successful, traffic that was 
previously blocked might be able to pass through the firewalls disguised as IPv6 packets.
In all such scenarios, administrators should assure that packets that send to or from 
IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses are subject to the same filtering as those directly 
sent to or from the embedded IPv4 addresses. 
</t>
<t>
The mechanisms for configuring firewalls and security devices to achieve this filtering 
are beyond the scope of this document.
