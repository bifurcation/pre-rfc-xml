    <abstract>
      <t>This memo provides the supporting test plan and results to advance
      RFC 2680, a performance metric RFC defining one-way packet loss metrics,
      along the Standards Track. Observing that the metric definitions
      themselves should be the primary focus rather than the implementations
      of metrics, this memo describes the test procedures to evaluate specific
      metric requirement clauses to determine if the requirement has been
      interpreted and implemented as intended. Two completely independent
      implementations have been tested against the key specifications of RFC
      2680.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group has considered
      how to advance their metrics along the Standards Track since 2001.</t>

      <t>The renewed work effort sought to investigate ways in which the
      measurement variability could be reduced in order to thereby simplify
      the problem of comparison for equivalence. As a result, there is
      consensus (captured in <xref target="RFC6576"/>) that equivalent results
      from independent implementations of metric specifications are sufficient
      evidence that the specifications themselves are clear and unambiguous;
      it is the parallel concept of protocol interoperability for metric
      specifications. The advancement process either (1) produces confidence
      that the metric definitions and supporting material are clearly worded
      and unambiguous or (2) identifies ways in which the metric definitions
      should be revised to achieve clarity. It is a non-goal to compare the
      specific implementations themselves.</t>

      <t>The process also permits identification of options described in the
      metric RFC that were not implemented, so that they can be removed from
      the advancing specification (this is an aspect more typical of protocol
      advancement along the Standards Track).</t>

      <t>This memo's purpose is to implement the current approach for <xref
      target="RFC2680"/> and document the results.</t>

      <t>In particular, this memo documents consensus on the extent of
      tolerable errors when assessing equivalence in the results. In
      discussions, the IPPM working group agreed that the test plan and
      procedures should include the threshold for determining equivalence, and
      this information should be available in advance of cross-implementation
      comparisons. This memo includes procedures for same-implementation
      comparisons to help set the equivalence threshold.</t>

      <t>Another aspect of the metric RFC advancement process is the
      requirement to document the work and results. The procedures of <xref
      target="RFC2026"/> are expanded in <xref target="RFC5657"/>, including
      sample implementation and interoperability reports. This memo follows
      the template in <xref target="RFC6808"/> for the report that accompanies
      the protocol action request submitted to the Area Director, including a
      description of the test setup, procedures, results for each
      implementation, and conclusions.</t>

      <t>The conclusion reached is that <xref target="RFC2680"/>, with
      modifications, should be advanced on the Standards Track. The revised
      text of RFC 2680 <xref target="LOSS-METRIC"/> is ready for review but
      awaits work in progress to update the IPPM Framework <xref
      target="RFC2330"/>. Therefore, this memo documents the information to
      support the advancement of <xref target="RFC2680"/>, and the approval of
      a revision of RFC 2680 is left for future action.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>. Some of these key words were used in
        <xref target="RFC2680"/>, but there are no requirements specified in
        this memo.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="RFC 2680 Coverage">
        <t>This plan is intended to cover all critical requirements and
        sections of <xref target="RFC2680"/>.</t>

        <t>Note that there are only five relevant instances of the requirement
        term "MUST" in <xref target="RFC2680"/>, outside of the boilerplate
        and <xref target="RFC2119"/> reference; the instance of "MUST" in the
        Security Considerations section of <xref target="RFC2680"/> is not a
        basis for implementation equivalence comparisons.</t>

        <t>Statements in RFC 2680 that have the character of requirements may
        be included if the community reaches consensus that the wording
        implies a requirement. At least one instance of an implied requirement
        has been found in Section 3.6 of <xref target="RFC2680"/>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="A Definition-Centric Metric Advancement Process">
      <t>The process described in Section 3.5 of <xref target="RFC6576"/>
      takes as a first principle that the metric definitions, embodied in the
      text of the RFCs, are the objects that require evaluation and possible
      revision in order to advance to the next step on the Standards Track.
      This memo follows that process.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="test_config" title="Test Configuration">
      <t>One metric implementation used was NetProbe version 5.8.5 (an earlier
      version is used in the WIPM system and deployed worldwide <xref
      target="WIPM"/>). NetProbe uses UDP packets of variable size and can
      produce test streams with Periodic <xref target="RFC3432"/> or Poisson
      <xref target="RFC2330"/> sample distributions.</t>

      <t>The other metric implementation used was Perfas+ version 3.1,
      developed by Deutsche Telekom <xref target="Perfas"/>. Perfas+ uses UDP
      unicast packets of variable size (but also supports TCP and multicast).
      Test streams with Periodic, Poisson, or uniform sample distributions may
      be used.</t>

      <t><xref target="L2TPv3_tunnel"/> shows a view of the test path as each
      implementation's test flows pass through the Internet and the Layer 2
      Tunneling Protocol version 3 (L2TPv3) <xref target="RFC3931"/> tunnel
      IDs (1 and 2), based on Figure 1 of <xref target="RFC6576"/>.</t>

      Illustrations of a test setup with a bidirectional tunnel.
      The upper diagram emphasizes the VLAN connectivity and
      geographical location (where "Imp #" is the sender and
      receiver of implementation 1 or 2 -- either Perfas+ or
      NetProbe in this test).  The lower diagram shows example
      flows traveling between two measurement implementations.
      For simplicity, only two flows are shown, and the netem
      emulator is omitted (it would appear before or after the
      Internet, depending on the flow).
        ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
      </t>

      <t>The testing employs the L2TPv3 <xref target="RFC3931"/> tunnel
      between test sites on the Internet. The tunnel IP and L2TPv3 headers are
      intended to conceal the test equipment addresses and ports from hash
      functions that would tend to spread different test streams across
      parallel network resources, with likely variation in performance as a
      result.</t>

      <t>At each end of the tunnel, one pair of VLANs encapsulated in the
      tunnel are looped back so that test traffic is returned to each test
      site. Thus, test streams traverse the L2TP tunnel twice but appear to be
      one-way tests from the point of view of the test equipment.</t>

      <t>The network emulator is a host running Fedora 14 Linux <xref
      target="FEDORA"/>, with IP forwarding enabled and the "netem" Network
      emulator as part of the Fedora Kernel 2.6.35.11 <xref target="NETEM"/>
      loaded and operating. The standard kernel is "tickless", replacing the
      previous periodic timer (250 Hz, with 4 ms uncertainty) interrupts with
      on-demand interrupts. Connectivity across the netem/Fedora host was
      accomplished by bridging Ethernet VLAN interfaces together with "brctl"
      commands (e.g., eth1.100 &lt;-&gt; eth2.100). The netem emulator was
      activated on one interface (eth1) and only operated on test streams
      traveling in one direction. In some tests, independent netem instances
      operated separately on each VLAN. See the Appendix for more details.</t>

      <t>The links between the netem emulator host, the router, and the switch
      were found to be 100BaseTX-HD (100 Mbps half duplex), as reported by
      "mii&nbhy;tool" <xref target="MII-TOOL"/> when testing was complete. The
      use of half duplex was not intended but probably added a small amount of
      delay variation that could have been avoided in full-duplex mode.</t>

      <t>Each individual test was run with common packet rates (1 pps, 10 pps)
      Poisson/Periodic distributions, and IP packet sizes of 64, 340, and 500
      bytes.</t>

      <t>For these tests, a stream of at least 300 packets was sent from
      source to destination in each implementation. Periodic streams (as per
      <xref target="RFC3432"/>) with 1-second spacing were used, except as
      noted.</t>

      <t>As required in Section 2.8.1 of <xref target="RFC2680"/>, packet
      Type-P must be reported. The packet Type-P for this test was IP-UDP with
      Best Effort Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP). These headers
      were encapsulated according to the L2TPv3 specification <xref
      target="RFC3931"/> and were unlikely to influence the treatment received
      as the packets traversed the Internet.</t>

      <t>With the L2TPv3 tunnel in use, the metric name for the testing
      configured here (with respect to the IP header exposed to Internet
      processing) is:</t>

      <t>Type-IP-protocol-115-One-way-Packet-Loss-&lt;StreamType&gt;-Stream</t>

      <t>With (Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC2680"/>) metric parameters:</t>

      <t>+ Src, the IP address of a host (12.3.167.16 or 193.159.144.8)</t>

      <t>+ Dst, the IP address of a host (193.159.144.8 or 12.3.167.16)</t>

      <t>+ T0, a time</t>

      <t>+ Tf, a time</t>

      <t>+ lambda, a rate in reciprocal seconds</t>

      <t>+ Thresh, a maximum waiting time in seconds (see Section 2.8.2 of
      <xref target="RFC2680"/>)</t>

      <t>Metric Units: A sequence of pairs; the elements of each pair are:</t>

      <t>+ T, a time, and</t>

      <t>+ L, either a zero or a one</t>

      <t>The values of T in the sequence are monotonically increasing. Note
      that T would be a valid parameter of *singleton*
      Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss and that L would be a valid value of
      Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss (see Section 3.3 of <xref
      target="RFC2680"/>).</t>

      <t>Also, Section 2.8.4 of <xref target="RFC2680"/> recommends that the
      path SHOULD be reported. In this test setup, most of the path details
      will be concealed from the implementations by the L2TPv3 tunnels; thus,
      a more informative path traceroute can be conducted by the routers at
      each location.</t>

      <t>When NetProbe is used in production, a traceroute is conducted in
      parallel at the outset of measurements.</t>

      <t>Perfas+ does not support traceroute.</t>

      <t>It was only possible to conduct the traceroute for the measured path
      on one of the tunnel-head routers (the normal trace facilities of the
      measurement systems are confounded by the L2TPv3 tunnel
      encapsulation).</t>

    <section title="Error Calibration and RFC 2680">
      <t>An implementation is required to report calibration results on clock
      synchronization per Section 2.8.3 of <xref target="RFC2680"/> (also
      required in Section 3.7 of <xref target="RFC2680"/> for sample
      metrics).</t>

      <t>Also, it is recommended to report the probability that a packet
      successfully arriving at the destination network interface is
      incorrectly designated as lost due to resource exhaustion in Section
      2.8.3 of <xref target="RFC2680"/>.</t>

      <section title="Clock Synchronization Calibration">
        <t>For NetProbe and Perfas+ clock synchronization test results, refer
        to Section 4 of <xref target="RFC6808"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Packet Loss Determination Error">
        <t>Since both measurement implementations have resource limitations,
        it is theoretically possible that these limits could be exceeded and a
        packet that arrived at the destination successfully might be discarded
        in error.</t>

        <t>In previous test efforts <xref target="ADV-METRICS"/>, NetProbe
        produced six multicast streams with an aggregate bit rate over 53
        Mbit/s, in order to characterize the one-way capacity of an emulator
        based on NIST Net. &nbsp;Neither the emulator nor the pair of NetProbe
        implementations used in this testing dropped any packets in these
        streams.</t>

        <t>The maximum load used here between any two NetProbe implementations
        was 11.5 Mbit/s divided equally among three unicast test streams. We
        concluded that steady resource usage does not contribute error
        (additional loss) to the measurements.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="limits" title="Predetermined Limits on Equivalence">
      <t>In this section, we provide the numerical limits on comparisons
      between implementations in order to declare that the results are
      equivalent and that the tested specification is therefore clear.</t>

      <t>A key point is that the allowable errors, corrections, and confidence
      levels only need to be sufficient to detect any misinterpretation of the
      tested specification that would indicate diverging implementations.</t>

      <t>Also, the allowable error must be sufficient to compensate for
      measured path differences. It was simply not possible to measure fully
      identical paths in the VLAN-loopback test configuration used, and this
      practical compromise must be taken into account.</t>

        <section title="NetProbe Results for Loss Threshold">
          <t>In NetProbe, the loss threshold was implemented uniformly over

          set at 3 seconds, all packets with one-way delay &gt;3 seconds were
          marked "Lost" and included in the Lost Packet list with their
          transmission time (as required in Section 3.3 of <xref
          target="RFC2680"/>). This resulted in 342 packets designated as lost
          in one of the test streams (with average delay = 3.091 sec).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Perfas+ Results for Loss Threshold">
          <t>Perfas+ uses a fixed loss threshold, which was not adjustable
          during this study. The loss threshold is approximately one minute,
          and emulation of a delay of this size was not attempted. However, it
          is possible to implement any delay threshold desired with a
          post-processing routine and subsequent analysis. Using this method,
          195 packets would be declared lost (with average delay = 3.091

        <section title="Conclusions for Loss Threshold">
          <t>Both implementations assume that any constant delay value desired
          can be used as the loss threshold, since all delays are stored as a
          pair &lt;Time, Delay&gt; as required in <xref target="RFC2680"/>.
          This is a simple way to enforce the constant loss threshold
          envisioned in <xref target="RFC2680"/> (see Section 2.8.2 of <xref
          target="RFC2680"/>). We take the position that the assumption of
          post-processing is compliant and that the text of the revision of
          RFC 2680 should be revised slightly to include this point.</t>

      <section title="One-Way Loss with Out-of-Order Arrival">
        <t>Section 3.6 of <xref target="RFC2680"/> indicates, with a lowercase
        "must" in the text, that implementations need to ensure that reordered
        packets are handled correctly. In essence, this is an implied
        requirement because the correct packet must be identified as lost if
        it fails to arrive before its delay threshold under all circumstances,
        and reordering is always a possibility on IP network paths. See <xref
        target="RFC4737"/> for the definition of reordering used in IETF
        standard-compliant measurements.</t>

        <t>The netem emulator can produce packet reordering because each
        packet's delay is drawn from an independent distribution. Here,
        significant delay (2000 ms) and delay variation (1000 ms) were
        sufficient to produce packet reordering. Using the procedure described
        in <xref target="adk-samp"/>, the netem emulator was set to introduce
        10% loss while reordering was present.</t>

      <section title="Poisson Sending Process Evaluation">
        <t>Section 3.7 of <xref target="RFC2680"/> indicates that
        implementations need to ensure that their sending process is
        reasonably close to a classic Poisson distribution when used. Much
        more detail on sample distribution generation and Goodness-of-Fit
        testing is specified in Section 11.4 of <xref target="RFC2330"/> and
        the Appendix of <xref target="RFC2330"/>.</t>

        <t>In this section, each implementation's Poisson distribution is
        compared with an idealistic version of the distribution available in
        the base functionality of the R-tool for Statistical Analysis <xref
        target="RTOOL"/> and performed using the Anderson-Darling
        Goodness-of-Fit test package (ADGofTest) <xref target="RADGOF"/>. The
        Goodness-of-Fit criterion derived from <xref target="RFC2330"/>
        requires a test statistic value AD &lt;= 2.492 for 5% significance.
        The Appendix of <xref target="RFC2330"/> also notes that there may be
        difficulty satisfying the ADGofTest when the sample includes many
        packets (when 8192 were used, the test always failed, but smaller sets
        of the stream passed).</t>

        <t>Both implementations were configured to produce Poisson
        distributions with lambda = 1 packet per second and to assign received
        packet timestamps in the measurement application (above the UDP layer;
        see the calibration results in Section 4 of <xref target="RFC6808"/>
        for error assessment).</t>

        <section title="NetProbe Results">
          <t>Section 11.4 of <xref target="RFC2330"/> suggests three possible
          measurement points to evaluate the Poisson distribution. The

          after the system call for transmitting the packet".</t>

          <t>Section 11.4 of <xref target="RFC2330"/> suggests three possible
          measurement points to evaluate the Poisson distribution. The Perfas+
          analysis uses "wire times for the packets as recorded using a packet
          filter". However, due to limited access at the Perfas+ side of the
          test setup, the captures were made after the Perfas+ streams
          traversed the production network, adding a small amount of unwanted
          delay variation to the wire times (and possibly error due to packet
          loss).</t>

        not specify the calculations exactly and only gives some illustrative

        consistent with widespread usage.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Conclusions for a Revision of RFC 2680">
      <t>This memo concludes that <xref target="RFC2680"/> should be advanced
      on the Standards Track and recommends the following edits to improve the
      text (which are not deemed significant enough to affect maturity).</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Revise Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss-Ave to
          Type-P-One-way-Delay-Packet-Loss-Ratio.</t>

          <t>Regarding implementation of the loss delay threshold (<xref
          target="delay-thresh"/>), the assumption of post-processing is
          compliant, and the text of the revision of RFC 2680 should be
          revised slightly to include this point.</t>

          <t>The IETF has reached consensus on guidance for reporting metrics
          <xref target="RFC6703"/>, and this memo should be referenced in a
          revision of RFC 2680 to incorporate recent experience where
          appropriate.</t>
        </list>We note that there are at least two errata for <xref
      target="RFC2680"/>, and it appears that these minor revisions should be
      incorporated in a revision of RFC 2680.</t>

      <t>The authors that revise <xref target="RFC2680"/> should review all
      errata filed at the time the document is being written. They should not
      rely upon this document to indicate all relevant errata updates.</t>

      <t>We recognize the existence of BCP 170 <xref target="RFC6390"/>, which
      provides guidelines for development of documents describing new
      performance metrics. However, the advancement of <xref
      target="RFC2680"/> represents fine-tuning of long-standing
      specifications based on experience that helped to formulate BCP 170, and
      material that satisfies some of the requirements of <xref
      target="RFC6390"/> can be found in other RFCs, such as the IPPM
      Framework <xref target="RFC2330"/>. Thus, no specific changes to address
      BCP 170 guidelines are recommended for a revision of RFC 2680.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
      live networks are relevant here as well. See <xref target="RFC4656"/>
      and <xref target="RFC5357"/>.</t>
