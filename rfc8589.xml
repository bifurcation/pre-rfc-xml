      <t>This document describes the 'leaptofrogans' Uniform Resource
      Identifier (URI) scheme, which enables applications to launch Frogans
      Player on a given Frogans site. Frogans is a medium for publishing
      content and services on the Internet, defined as a generic software
      layer on the Internet. Frogans Player is software that enables end users
      to browse Frogans sites.</t>

    <section title="Background Information">
      <t></t>

      <section title="About Frogans">

        <t>Frogans is a medium for publishing content and services on the
	Internet. From its inception in 1999, the medium was designed as a
	generic software layer running on top of the original Internet
	infrastructure (i.e., the TCP and IP protocols and the Domain Name
	System (DNS)), alongside other existing layers such as E-mail or the
	World Wide Web.</t> 

        <t>As a medium, Frogans is not meant for publishing Web sites, but
	Frogans sites, a kind of site founded upon a different format,
	enabling a different kind of communication between end users and
	publishers of content and services.</t> 

        <t>Frogans is intended to be complementary to the World Wide Web; it is
	not intended to be a replacement. This is analogous to instant messaging, which was
	not intended to and did not replace E-mail.</t> 

        <t>Compared to the World Wide Web, Frogans suggests publishing content
	and services that involve visual rather than
	text-based communication, focused content rather than long pages, and
	natural interaction rather than complex user interfaces. For further
	information on the reasons for introducing Frogans on the Internet,
	and for an in-depth discussion of the similarities and differences
	between Frogans sites and Web sites, see <xref target="FSDL"
	format="default"/>, Section 1.4 ("Frogans sites and Web sites").</t> 

        <t>The technology making up the medium, i.e., the Frogans technology,
	includes multiple components such as:</t> 

        <t><list style="symbols">

          <t>An XML-based language, called Frogans Slide Description Language
	  <xref target="FSDL" format="default"/>, used to develop Frogans
	  sites.</t> 

          <t>International identifiers, called Frogans addresses <xref
	  target="IFAP" format="default"/>, used to access Frogans sites. Each
	  Frogans site has its own Frogans address.</t> 

          <t>Browsing software, called Frogans Player, enabling end users to
	  browse Frogans sites. An end user opens a Frogans site by entering
	  its Frogans address in Frogans Player.</t> 

          <t>A registry, called the Frogans Core Registry (FCR), that contains
	  all Frogans addresses registered by Frogans site publishers. The
	  registry operator, called the FCR Operator, ensures the resolution
	  of Frogans addresses when end users enter them in Frogans
	  Player.</t> 

        </list></t>

    <section title="The Need for a New URI Scheme and Its Purpose" anchor="need_for_new">

      <t>Generic software layers running on top of the original Internet
      infrastructure offer mechanisms that enable end users to easily go from
      one layer to another, in both directions. For example, end users can
      easily launch their usual Web browser on a given Web page from a message
      in their usual E-mail client; in the other direction, end users can
      easily launch their usual E-mail client with a given E-mail address from
      a Web page in their usual Web browser. This is commonly achieved using
      URIs <xref target="RFC3986" format="default"/>.</t> 

      <t>As regards Frogans as a medium, in the outgoing direction, FSDL
      enables Frogans site publishers to include way-out buttons in their
      Frogans sites. These buttons enable end users to launch their usual Web
      browser on a given Web page, or to launch their usual E-mail client with
      a given E-mail address. This is achieved by associating a URI with each
      of those way-out buttons (the scheme of the URI can be any of 'http',
      'https', or 'mailto').</t> 

      <t>Conversely, in the incoming direction, Web-site publishers should
      have a means to include in their Web pages links that enable end users to
      launch Frogans Player on a given Frogans site. Likewise, people writing
      E-mail messages should have a means to include in their messages links
      that enable recipients to launch Frogans Player on a given Frogans
      site. More generally, any end-user application should be able to launch
      Frogans Player on a given Frogans site.</t> 

      <t>To achieve this, a new URI scheme, containing a Frogans address, is needed.</t>

      <t>Given that Frogans, as a medium, does not enable deep linking for
      Frogans sites, there is no need for additional information in the new
      URI scheme other than the Frogans address.</t> 

      <t>The use of a media type as a means to include on a Web page a link
      that enables end users to launch Frogans Player on a given Frogans site was
      tested in 2006 with the registration of the 'vnd.frogans.ltf' media type
      with IANA <xref target="LTF" format="default"/>. But use of a media
      type was determined to be unsatisfactory for several reasons. First, for
      any such link included on a Web page, the author of the Web page had to
      create and host a .ltf file on the Web server hosting that Web page,
      which was cumbersome. Furthermore, prior to creating such links, the
      author had to ask the server administrator to associate the .ltf files
      with the 'vnd.frogans.ltf' media type on the server. Alternatively, the
      author could create a link via a redirection service that would
      generate a .ltf file on the fly while associating it with the
      'vnd.frogans.ltf' media type. But that alternative raised privacy
      concerns and potentially added latency for end users. Finally, on the
      Web browser side, it appeared that using a media type from a Web page to
      launch another application did not always work, especially on mobile
      devices.</t> 

    </section>

    <section title="Choice of the Scheme Name">

      <t>The name chosen for the new URI scheme is 'leaptofrogans'.</t>

      <t>This scheme name was chosen in compliance with <xref target="RFC7595"
      format="default"/>, Section 3.8 ("Scheme Name Considerations").</t> 

      <t>The following shorter names were discussed, but they were not chosen:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">

        <t>'ltf': this name, an acronym for "leap to Frogans", was considered
	insufficiently descriptive, especially for typical end users who have
	little technical knowledge.</t> 

        <t>'leapto': this name was considered overly general, and it is not
	specifically associated with Frogans.</t> 
 
        <t>'frogans': this name was rejected because it could create confusion
	between URIs based on this scheme and those Frogans addresses that
	start with "frogans".</t> 

      </list></t>

    </section>

    <section title="Scheme Syntax" anchor="scheme_syntax">

      <t>Frogans addresses <xref target="IFAP" format="default"/> are
      international identifiers made up of Unicode characters. Thus, a method
      for encoding non-US-ASCII characters is necessary when the new scheme is
      used as a URI. The new scheme can also be useful as an IRI <xref
      target="RFC3987" format="default"/> in contexts where IRIs are
      allowed.</t> 

      <section title="URI Scheme">

        <t>The syntax for the 'leaptofrogans' URI scheme is:</t>

        <t><list>

          <t>leaptofrogans-uri = "leaptofrogans:" pct-encoded-frogans-address</t>

        </list></t>

        <t>where pct-encoded-frogans-address is a Frogans address compliant
	with <xref target="IFAP" format="default"/> and whose Unicode
	characters are each encoded as follows:</t> 

        <t><list style="symbols">

          <t>If the character is a US-ASCII character, do not replace it and skip to the next character. Note that according to <xref target="IFAP" format="default"/>, the US-ASCII character cannot be the U+0025 PERCENT SIGN character.</t>

          <t> Otherwise, apply steps 1 through 3 below:

            <list style="format %d.">
              <t>Convert the character to a sequence of one or more octets
	      using UTF-8 <xref target="UTF-8" format="default"/></t> 

              <t>Convert each octet to %HH, where HH is the hexadecimal
	      notation of the octet value. Note that this is identical to the
	      percent-encoding mechanism in Section 2.1 of <xref
	      target="RFC3986" format="default"/>.</t> 

              <t>Replace the original character with the resulting character
	      sequence (i.e., a sequence of %HH triplets).</t> 

            </list>
          </t>

        </list></t>

        <t>Examples of 'leaptofrogans' URIs:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
          <?rfc text-list-symbols="-"?>

          <t>if the Frogans address is the string of US-ASCII characters
	  "Network-Name*Site-Name", the URI is as follows:</t> 

        </list></t>

        <t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="5">

          <t>leaptofrogans:Network-Name*Site-Name</t>

        </list></t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
          <?rfc text-list-symbols="-"?>

          <t>if the Frogans address is the string of Unicode characters
	  U+7F51, U+7EDC, U+540D, U+002A, U+7AD9, U+540D (which is a Chinese
	  translation of the Frogans address in the previous example), the URI
	  is as follows: </t>

        </list></t>

        <t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="5">

              <t>leaptofrogans:%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%E5%90%8D*%E7%AB%99%E5%90%8D</t>

        </list></t>

      </section>

      <section title="IRI Usage and Encoding">

        <t>The syntax for an IRI corresponding to the 'leaptofrogans' URI scheme is:</t>

        <t><list>

          <t>leaptofrogans-iri = "leaptofrogans:" frogans-address</t>

        </list></t>

        <t>where frogans-address is a Frogans address compliant with <xref target="IFAP" format="default"/> and encoded in UTF-8 <xref target="UTF-8" format="default"/>.</t>

        <t>In contexts where both URIs and IRIs are allowed, end-user
	applications can use either a URI or an IRI based on the
	'leaptofrogans' URI scheme when launching Frogans Player on a given
	Frogans site. This is because Frogans Player must interpret both URIs
	and IRIs based on the 'leaptofrogans' URI scheme. If the U+0025
	PERCENT SIGN character is found in the string, then the string will be
	interpreted by Frogans Player as a URI; otherwise, it will be
	interpreted as an IRI.</t>

      <t>The author of a Web page can create a link where the true nature of

      <t>For URIs based on the 'leaptofrogans' URI scheme, the risk of
