    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        RFC 5988  
        standardized a means of indicating the relationships between resources on the Web. 
        This specification defines a pair of reciprocal link relation types that may be
        used to express the relationship between a collection and its members.         
      </t>
      <t>
        These link relation types can be applied to a wide range of use cases across
        multiple media types. For example, the 'collection' and 'item' link relation types are used in 
        these media types:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>OpenSearch 1.1: see Section 4.5.4.1 of <xref target="OpenSearch" /></t>
          <t>Maze+XML: see <xref target="Maze"/></t>
          <t>Collection+JSON: see <xref target="CollectionJSON"/></t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="Link Relations">
      <t>
        <!--<cref>DESCRIBE THE SEMANTICS OF THE LINK RELATION</cref>-->
        The following link relations are defined.
      </t>
      <section title="'item'">
        <t>
          When included in a resource that represents a collection, 
          the 'item' link relation identifies a target resource that represents a  
          member of that collection.
        </t>
        <t>
          For example, if a resource represents a catalog of products, that same representation
          may include one or more links to resources that represent members of that catalog.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
<html>
...
  <h1>Product Group X Listing</h1>
  ...
  <a href="..." rel="item">View Product X001</a>
  <a href="..." rel="item">View Product X002</a>
  ...
</html> ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>or, in the case of a Link Header field</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
Link: <...>; rel="item"; title="View Product X001"
Link: <...>; rel="item"; title="View Product X002"
]]></artwork>
        </figure>
      </section>
      <section title="'collection'">
        <t>
          When included in a resource that represents a member of a collection, 
          the 'collection' link relation identifies a target resource that represents a collection 
          of which the context resource is a member. 
        </t>
        <t>
          For example, if a resource represents a single product in a catalog, that same representation
          may include a link to a resource that represents a product group to which this single product belongs:
        </t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
<a href="..." rel="collection">Return to Product Group X</a>
          ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>or, in the case of a Link Header field</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
Link: <...>; rel="collection"; title="Return to Product Group X"
]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          Since it is possible that a resource could be a member of multiple collections, 
          multiple 'collection' link relations may appear within the same representation:
        </t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
<a href="..." rel="collection">View other widgets</a>
<a href="..." rel="collection">View all discontinued items</a>          ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          The target resource representation need not be restricted to representing a list. It may simply
          be a document that provides details on the collection of which the context 
          resource is a member: 
        </t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
Link: <...>; rel="collection"; 
      title="Shakespeare's Collected Works - A History"
]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          It should also be noted that the same link might represent an 'item' in one collection
          as well as a 'collection' itself. In this case, both link relation values can be applied
          to the same link:
        </t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
Link: <...>; rel="collection item";
