 <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management 
    Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in 
    the Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects
    for modeling ATM Pseudowire (PW) carrying ATM cells over Packet Switched Networks 
    (PSNs).</t>

<section title="Introduction">

 <t>This document describes a model for managing "emulated" ATM services 
over a Packet Switched Network (PSN).</t>  
  <t>The document follows the requirements for Pseudowire Emulation
    Edge-to-Edge <xref target="PWREQ" />; it is closely related to <xref target="ATMENCAP" /> and <xref target="ATMTRANS" />,
which describe the encapsulation of ATM signals and provide the 
 Emulation Service over a Packet Switched Network. </t>  
 
 <t>The ATM management model consists of several MIB modules, 
 following the layering model described in the PWE3 Architecture <xref target="PWARCH" /> document. 
 The ATM MIB module described in this document works closely with 
 the MIB modules described in <xref target="AToMTC" />, <xref target="AToM" />, <xref target="IFMIB" />, 
 <xref target="PWMIB" />, and the textual conventions defined in <xref target="PWTC" />. 
 The conceptual layering and relationship among all of those is described in 
 <xref target="FigLayering" /> and in the "Relation to Other PW-MIB Modules" section listed below. An ATM connection will be a 
 pseudowire (PW) connection. It will not be treated as an interface and 
will therefore not be represented in the ifTable. </t>

 <artwork><![CDATA[

This document follows the terminology used in PW Architecture 
[PWARCH].


PSN-bound           References the traffic direction where an ATM Cell
                    is received, adapted to the packet, assigned a PW
                    label, and sent into the PSN.  Within the MIB 
                    objects, it is called outbound.  
    
CE-bound            The direction where packets are received 
                    from the PSN, cells are reconstructed from the 
                    packet payloads, and are sent into the ATM network 
                    as cells.  Within the MIB objects, it is called 
                    inbound.  

   
Adaptation          Refers to the method of adapting a "foreign"
                    communications protocol such that it can be
                    carried by a packet switched net (the PSN).  For
                    example, in an ATM service, the foreign protocol
                    is ATM.  The PSN may be MPLS.
   
PSN                 Packet Switched Network.
   
PSN Tunnel          A general term indicating a virtual connection
                    between the two PW edge devices.  In practice,
                    this connection is not limited to path-oriented
                    types of PSNs such as MPLS.  An example of a non-
                    path-oriented PSN is an IP PSN.

<section title="The Internet-Standard Management Framework"> 

 <t> For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current    
 Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of   
 RFC 3410 <xref target="RFC3410" />.</t>

 <t> Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed   
 the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally   
 accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).   
 Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the   
 Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB   
 module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
 RFC 2578 <xref target="RFC2578" />, STD 58, RFC 2579 <xref target="RFC2579" /> and STD 58, RFC 2580   
 <xref target="RFC2580" />. </t>   

</section>

<section title="Overview">

<t>This MIB module is designed to satisfy the following requirements and 
   constraints: </t>
<list style="symbols">

</list> 
</section>

<section title="Relation to Other PW-MIB Modules">
<t>The MIB structure for defining a PW service is composed of three
   layers of MIB modules functioning together. This general model is
   defined in the PWE3 Architecture <xref target="PWARCH" />. The layering model is
   intended to sufficiently isolate PW services from the underlying PSN
   layer that carries the emulated service. This is done at the same
   time as providing a standard means for connecting any supported
   services to any supported PSNs.</t>
   
<t>The first layer, known as the service layer, contains service-specific
   modules such as the one defined in this document. These modules
   define service-specific management objects that interface or
   collaborate with existing MIB modules for the native version of the
   service. The service-specific module "glues" the standard module to
   the PWE MIB framework.</t>
   
<t>The next layer of the PWE MIB framework is comprised of the PW-MIB
   module <xref target="PWMIB" />. This module is used to configure general parameters
   of PW connections that are common to all types of emulated services and PSNs.
   This layer is connected to the service-specific layer above, and the
   PSN layer below.</t>
   
<t>The PSN layer provides PSN-specific modules for each type of PSN.
   These modules associate the PW with one or more "tunnels" that carry
   the service over the PSN. These modules are defined in other
   documents. This module is used to "glue" the PW service to the
   underlying PSN-specific MIB modules. In the case of MPLS, for
   example, the PW-MPLS MIB <xref target="PWMPLSMIB" /> is used to connect the PW
   service to either the MPLS-LDP <xref target="LDPMIB" /> or MPLS-TE <xref target="TEMIB" /> MIBs.</t>
   
<t><xref target="PWTC" /> defines some of the object types used in these modules.</t>
 
</section>

 <section title="ATM-PW MIB Usage">

<t>This section provides an example of using the MIB objects
    described in section 9 to set up an ATM PW. While this example is not
    meant to illustrate every permutation of the MIB, it is intended as
    an aid in the understanding of some key concepts. It is meant to be 
    read after going through the MIB itself. See <xref target="PWMIB" /> for an example 
    of setting up a PSN Tunnel.</t> 


<t>The following example illustrates how a user will set up an ATM
    Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5) ATM  
    PW on a switch/router with cells entering the switch/router through 
    ATM Interface with IfIndex 1000 <xref target="IFMIB" />, Virtual
Path Identifier (VPI) 1 and Virtual Circuit Identifier (VCI) 100 (from
an ATM network to a PSN -- outbound direction) and on the way back, it goes out of the
    switch/router through ATM Interface 1000 with VPI 1 and VCI 100 (PSN
    to ATM network -- inbound direction).</t>

<t>First create an entry in the PW MIB with pwType atmAal5SduVcc(2),
    then create entries in the pwAtmCfg table, inbound and outbound tables.</t>

  <t>This MIB consists of 4 types of tables;</t>
  <t>It is important to note that the TrafficParamDescr Table 
  is not defined as part of this MIB, although an object pointing 
  to such a table entry exists in all configuration tables of this MIB module.

  <t> PW ATM Outbound Table:

    One table for 1:1 service, and the other for N:1 service and transparent cell

  <t> PW ATM Inbound Table:
There are two tables to configure an inbound ATM PW depending on the type of 
service. One table for 1:1 service, and the other for N:1 service and transparent cell mode. </t> 

    <t> PW ATM Perf Table:
    There are three tables; each contains the relevant time-dependent statistics 
    for an ATM PW Entry.  There is a current table, a 15-minute interval table, 
    and a one-day interval table. The tables are aligned with statistic models of 
    other PW services.</t>

<section title="Security Considerations"> 
      
 <t>There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
 with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
 objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
 environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
 environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
 network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their 
 sensitivity/vulnerability: </t> 

 <t>The pwAtmOutboundTable, pwAtmInboundTable, pwAtmCfgTable, pwAtmOutboundNto1Table,
 and pwAtmInboundNto1Table contain 
 objects of ATM PW parameters on a Provider Edge (PE) device. 
 Unauthorized access to objects in these tables could result in 
 disruption of traffic on the network. </t>

 <t>The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should 
 be considered where possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and 
 USM MUST be used with any SNMPV3 agent, which implements this MIB 
 module.  Administrators should consider whether read access to 
 these objects should be allowed, since read access may be 
 undesirable under certain circumstances. </t>

 <t>Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with 
 a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive 
 or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to 
 control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly 
 to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over 
 the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their 
 sensitivity/vulnerability: </t>

 <t>The pwATMCfgTable, pwAtmPerfCurrentTable, 
 pwAtmPerfIntervalTable, and pwAtmPerf1DayIntervalTable collectively 
 show the ATM pseudowire connectivity topology and its 
 performance characteristics. </t>

 <t>If an Administrator does not want to reveal this information, 
 then these tables should be considered sensitive/vulnerable. </t> 

 <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
 Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), 
 even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
 allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the 
 objects in this MIB module. </t>

 <t>It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
 as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"/>, section 8), 
 including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
 authentication and privacy).</t> 

 <t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
 RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
 enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
 responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
 instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access 
 to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
 rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them. </t>

   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
   capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
   interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
   should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

<list>
<t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119.

</t></list></t>

<t>This document describes base requirements for the Pseudo-Wire Emulation Edge to Edge Working Group (PWE3 WG).  It provides guidelines for other working group documents that will define mechanisms for providing pseudo-wire emulation of Ethernet, ATM, and Frame Relay.  Requirements for pseudo-wire emulation of TDM (i.e., "synchronous bit streams at rates defined by ITU G.702") are defined in another document.  It should be noted that the PWE3 WG standardizes mechanisms that can be used to provide PWE3 services, but not the services themselves.
