    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
                <t>
            The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) <xref target="RFC4975" /> expects to use MSRP relays
            <xref target="RFC4976" /> as a means for 
            Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal and policy enforcement.
            However, many Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261" /> networks, which deploy MSRP, contain 
            middleboxes.  These middleboxes anchor and control media;
            perform tasks 
            such as NAT traversal, performance monitoring, and address 
            domain bridging; interconnect Service Level Agreement (SLA) policy 
            enforcement; and so on.  One example is the Interconnection Border Control 
            Function (IBCF) <xref target="GPP23228" />, 
            defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). The IBCF controls a
            media relay that handles all types of SIP session media, such as voice, video, 
            MSRP, etc.
                </t>
                <t>
            MSRP, as defined in RFC 4975 <xref target="RFC4975" /> and RFC 4976
<xref target="RFC4976" />, cannot anchor through middleboxes.  The reason is that
            MSRP messages have routing information embedded in the message. Without an 
            extension such as CEMA, middleboxes must read the message to change the routing
            information. This occurs because middleboxes modify the address:port information 
            in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref target="RFC4566" />
c/m&nbhy;line in order to anchor media. An "active" <xref target="RFC6135" /> MSRP
User Agent (UA) establishes
            the MSRP TCP or Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection based on the MSRP URI of the SDP 'path' attribute. 
            This means that the MSRP connection will not be routed through the
middlebox
            unless the middlebox also modifies the MSRP URI of the topmost SDP 'path' attribute.
             In many scenarios, this will prevent the MSRP connection from being established. 
            In addition, if the middlebox modifies the MSRP URI of the SDP 'path'
            attribute, then the MSRP URI comparison procedure <xref target="RFC4975" />, which requires consistency between the address 
            information in the MSRP messages and the address information carried in the MSRP URI 
            of the SDP 'path' attribute, will fail.
                </t>
                <t>
            The only way to achieve interoperability in this situation is for the middlebox 
            to act as an MSRP back-to-back User Agent (B2BUA). Here, the MSRP B2BUA acts as the 
            endpoint for the MSRP signaling and media, performs the corresponding modification 
            in the associated MSRP messages, and originates a new MSRP session toward the actual remote
            endpoint. However, the enabling of MSRP B2BUA functionality requires substantially more 
            resource usage in the middlebox, which normally results in a
negative impact on performance. 
            In addition, the MSRP message needs to be exposed in cleartext to the MSRP B2BUA, which 
            violates the end-to-end principle <xref target="RFC3724"/>.
                </t>
                <t>
            This specification defines an MSRP extension, Connection Establishment for Media 
            Anchoring (CEMA). In most cases, CEMA allows MSRP endpoints to communicate through 
            middleboxes as defined in <xref target="S.conventions"/>, 
            without a need for the middleboxes to be MSRP B2BUAs. In such cases, middleboxes that 
            want to anchor the MSRP connection simply modify the SDP c/m-line address information, similar 
            to what the middleboxes do for non-MSRP media types. MSRP endpoints that support the CEMA 
            extension will use the SDP c/m-line address information for establishing the TCP or TLS 
            connection for sending and receiving MSRP messages.
                </t>
                <t>
            The CEMA extension is backward compatible, meaning that CEMA-enabled MSRP endpoints
            can communicate with non-CEMA-enabled endpoints. In scenarios where
            MSRP endpoints do not support the CEMA extension, an MSRP endpoint
            that supports the CEMA extension behaves in the same way as an MSRP
            endpoint that does not support it. The CEMA extension only provides
            an alternative mechanism for negotiating and providing address
            information for the MSRP TCP connection. After the creation of the
            MSRP connection, an MSRP endpoint that supports the CEMA extension 
            acts according to the procedures for creating MSRP messages, performing 
            checks when receiving MSRP messages defined in RFC 4975 and, when it 
            is using a relay for MSRP communications, RFC&nbsp;4976.

            This document defines a Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)
            extension, Connection Establishment for Media Anchoring (CEMA). 
            Support of this extension is OPTIONAL. The extension allows 
            Middleboxes to anchor the MSRP connection, without the need for 
            Middleboxes to modify the MSRP messages; thus, it also enables 
            secure end-to-end MSRP communication in networks where such Middleboxes 
            are deployed. The document also defines a Session Description Protocol 
            (SDP) attribute, 'msrp-cema', that MSRP endpoints use to indicate 
            support of the CEMA extension.

                <t>
            The CEMA extension is primarily intended for MSRP endpoints that
            operate in networks in which Middleboxes that want to anchor media
            connections are deployed, without the need for the Middleboxes to
            enable MSRP B2BUA functionality.  An example of such a network
            is the
            IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), defined by the 3rd Generation
            Partnership Project (3GPP), which also has the capability for all 
            endpoints to use name-based TLS authentication. The extension is also 
            useful for other MSRP endpoints that operate in other networks but that 
            communicate with MSRP endpoints in networks with such Middleboxes,
            unless there is a gateway between these networks that by default always 
            enables MSRP B2BUA functionality.

                <t>
            This document assumes certain behaviors on the part of Middleboxes, as 
            described in <xref target="S.assumption"/>. 
            These behaviors are not standardized. If Middleboxes do not behave as assumed, 
            then the CEMA extension does not add any value over base MSRP behavior. MSRP 
            endpoints that support CEMA are required to use RFC 4975 behavior in cases 
            where they detect that the CEMA extension cannot be enabled.

                In order to support interoperability between UAs that support the
                CEMA extension and UAs that do not support the extension, the
                Middlebox is MSRP aware.  This means that it implements MSRP B2BUA
                functionality. The Middlebox enables that functionality in cases
                where the offerer does not support the CEMA extension. In
                cases where the SDP offer indicates support of the CEMA extension,
                the Middlebox can simply modify the SDP c/m-line address information
                for the MSRP connection.

                In cases where the Middlebox enables MSRP B2BUA functionality, it
                acts as an MSRP endpoint.  If it does not use the CEMA procedures,
                it will never forward the SDP 'msrp-cema' attribute in SDP offers

                SDP offer, CEMA-enabled MSRP endpoints will in some cases be unable to

                Middleboxes do not need to parse and modify the MSRP payload when
                endpoints use the CEMA extension. A Middlebox that does not parse
                the MSRP payload probably will not be able to reuse TCP connections
                for multiple MSRP sessions. Instead, in order to associate an MSRP message 
                with a specific session, the Middlebox often assigns a unique local 
                address:port combination for each MSRP session. Due to this, between two 
                Middleboxes there might be a separate connection for each MSRP session.

                When UAs fall back to RFC 4975 behavior, Middleboxes act as TLS B2BUAs.                
                The Middlebox decrypts MSRP media packets received from one MSRP endpoint and 
                then re-encrypts them before sending them toward the other MSRP endpoint. 
                Middleboxes can inspect and modify the MSRP message content.

            <t>
                Unless otherwise stated, the security considerations in RFC 4975 and 
                RFC 4976 still apply. This section only describes additions and 
                changes introduced by the CEMA extension.
            </t>
            <t>
                The purpose of CEMA is to enable MSRP communication over Middleboxes.
                These Middleboxes are commonly deployed by SIP network operators, who
                also commonly deploy firewall and routing policies that prevent media
                sessions from working unless they traverse the Middleboxes.
            </t>
            <t>
                CEMA makes it possible for Middleboxes to tunnel TLS to allow end-to-
                end SAs between endpoints. This is an improvement
                over the status quo, since without CEMA, the Middleboxes would be
                forced to both read and modify the cleartext MSRP messages, which
                would make end-to-end confidentiality and integrity protection
                of the MSRP transport channel impossible.
            </t>
            <t>
                RFC 4975 suggests two ways for MSRP endpoints to verify that the TLS
                connection is established end to end. The first option is to use
                certificates from a well-known certification authority and verify
                that the SubjectAltName matches the MSRP URI of the other side. The
                second option is to use self-signed certificates and include a
                fingerprint of the certificate in the SDP offer/answer. Provided the
                signaling is integrity protected, both endpoints can verify that the
                TLS SA is established with the correct host by matching the
                received certificate against the received fingerprint.
            </t>
            <t>
                Fingerprint-based authentication is expected to be common for end
                clients. In order to ensure the integrity of the fingerprint,
                RFC&nbsp;4975 recommends using the SIP Identity mechanism <xref target="RFC4474" />. However, this mechanism may not 
                be compatible with CEMA, which operates under the assumption that 
                Middleboxes will modify the contents of 
                SDP offers and answers. Until a mechanism is available that enables a 
                subset of the SDP to be signed, end clients that support CEMA and use 
                fingerprint-based authentication are forced to trust the entire 
                signaling path. In other words, end clients must accept the fact 
                that every signaling proxy could potentially replace the fingerprints 
                and insert a Middlebox that acts as a TLS B2BUA.
            </t>
            <t>
                An alternative solution that only requires a limited trust in the
                signaling plane is to use self-signed certificates together with the
                SIP Certificate Management Service <xref target="RFC6072" />. The security provided by this 
                solution is roughly equivalent to SIP Identity and fingerprint-based 
                authentication (in fact, RFC 6072 is based on RFC&nbsp;4474). <xref target="sec-security-ackm"/> discusses this approach further.
            </t>
            <t>
                In the remainder of this section, we will assume that fingerprint-based 
                authentication is used without SIP Identity or similar mechanisms that 
                protect the SDP across several hops.

            <t>
                If TLS is not used to protect MSRP, the CEMA extension might make it 
                easier for a MITM to transparently insert itself in the 
                communication between MSRP endpoints in order to monitor or record 
                unprotected MSRP communication. This can be mitigated by the use of 
                TLS. It is therefore RECOMMENDED that TLS <xref
target="RFC5246" /> be used. It is also recommended that TLS be used end to end,
                which CEMA enables even in the case of Middleboxes. According to 
                RFC 4975, MSRP endpoints are required to support TLS. This also applies 
                to CEMA-enabled endpoints.

            <t>
                If TLS is used without Middleboxes, the security considerations in RFC 4975 and RFC 4976 
                still apply unchanged. Note that this is not the main use case for the CEMA extension.

                <section anchor="sec-security-tlswm" title="TLS Usage with Middleboxes" toc="default">
            <t>
                This is the main use case for the CEMA extension; the endpoints expect one or more 
                Middleboxes.
            </t>
            <t>
                The CEMA extension supports the usage of both name-based authentication and fingerprint-based authentication for TLS in the presence of Middleboxes. The use of fingerprint-based 
                authentication requires signaling integrity protection. This
can, for example, be hop-by-hop 
                cryptographic protection or cryptographic access protection combined with a suitably protected 
                core network. As stated in <xref target="sdp-integrity"/>, this document assumes 
                that Middleboxes are able to modify the SDP address information associated with the MSRP 
                media. 
            </t>
            <t>
                If a Middlebox acts as a TLS B2BUA, the security considerations
are the same as those without the 
                CEMA extension. In such a case, the Middlebox acts as a TLS endpoint.
            </t>
            <t>
                If a Middlebox does not act as a TLS B2BUA, TLS is end to end and the Middlebox just forwards the 
                TLS packets. This requires that both peers support the CEMA extension.
            </t>
            <t>
                If fingerprint-based authentication is used, the MSRP endpoints might not be able to decide 
                whether or not the Middlebox acts as a TLS B2BUA. But this is not an issue, as the signaling 
                network is considered trusted by the endpoint (a requirement to use fingerprint-based authentication).

                <section anchor="sec-security-ackm" title="Authentication, Credentials, and Key Management" toc="default">                
            <t>
                One issue with the usage of TLS (not specific to CEMA) is the availability of a PKI. Endpoints 
                can always provide self-signed certificates and include fingerprints in the SDP offer and 
                answer. However, this relies on SDP signaling being integrity protected, which may not always 
                be the case.
            </t>
            <t>
                Therefore, in addition to the authentication mechanisms defined in RFC 4975, it is RECOMMENDED 
                that a CEMA-enabled MSRP endpoint also support self-signed certificates together with the Certificate 
                Management Service <xref target="RFC6072" />, to which it publishes 
                its self-signed certificate and from which it fetches on demand the self-signed certificates of 
                other endpoints.
            </t>

                Alternate key distribution mechanisms, such as DNS-Based
Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) <xref target="DANE"/>, Pretty Good
Privacy (PGP) <xref target="RFC6091" />, Ticket-Based Modes of Key Distribution in
Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY-TICKET) <xref target="RFC6043" />, or some 
                other technology, might become ubiquitous enough to solve the key distribution problem in the future.
            </t>
            <t>
                One of the target deployments for CEMA is the 3GPP IMS SIP network. In this environment, authentication 
                and credential management are less of a problem, as the SDP signaling is mostly considered trusted, service 
                providers provision signed certificates or manage signed certificates on behalf of their subscribers, 
                and MIKEY-TICKET is available. Some of these options require trusting the service provider, but those 
                issues are beyond the scope of this document.

            <t>
                The CEMA extension does not change the endpoint procedures for TLS negotiation. As in RFC 4975, the 
                MSRP endpoint uses the negotiation mechanisms in SDP and then the TLS handshake to agree on mechanisms 
                and algorithms that both support. The mechanisms can be divided into three different security levels:
            </t>

                <t>MSRPS: Security mechanisms that do not rely on trusted signaling, such as name-based authentication

            <t>
                If the endpoint uses security mechanisms that do not rely on trusted signaling, the endpoint can detect if a 
                Middlebox that acts as a B2BUA is inserted. It is therefore
RECOMMENDED that such a mechanism be used.
            </t>
            <t>
                If the endpoint uses security mechanisms that rely on trusted signaling, the endpoint may not be able to detect 
                if a Middlebox that acts as a B2BUA is inserted (by the trusted network operator). To be able to eavesdrop, a 
                Middlebox must do an active "attack" on the setup signaling. A Middlebox cannot insert itself at a later point.
            </t>
            <t>
                If unprotected MSRP is used, the endpoint cannot detect if a Middlebox that acts as a B2BUA is inserted and 
                Middleboxes may be inserted at any time during the session.
            </t>
            <t>
                The mechanism in RFC 6072 <xref target="RFC6072" /> provides end-to-end 
                security without relying on trust in the signaling plane
                and eases the use and deployment of name-based 
                authentication.
            </t>
            <t>
                The procedures for choosing and offering name-based authentication, fingerprint-based authentication, and 
                unprotected MSRP as described in RFC 4975 still apply. 
            </t>

            <t>
                If the endpoint cannot use a key management protocol that does not rely on trust in the signaling plane,
                such as name-based authentication, the only alternative is fingerprint-based authentication.
            </t>
            <t>
                The use of fingerprint-based authentication requires integrity protection of the signaling plane. 
                This can, for example, be hop-by-hop cryptographic protection or cryptographic access protection combined 
                with a suitably protected core network. Unless cryptographic end-to-end SDP integrity protection 
                or encryption is used, this may be hard for the endpoint to decide. In the end, it is up to the 
                endpoint to decide whether the signaling path is trusted
                or&nbsp;not.
            </t>
            <t>
                How this decision is done is implementation specific, but normally, signaling over the Internet SHOULD 
                NOT be trusted. Signaling over a local or closed network might
be trusted. Such networks can, for example, be a 
                closed enterprise network or a network operated by an operator
that the end user trusts. In IMS, for example,
                the signaling traffic in the access network is integrity protected and the traffic is routed over a 
                closed network separated from the Internet. If the network is not trusted, the endpoints SHOULD NOT use fingerprint-based authentication.
            </t>
            <t>
                When an endpoint receives a fingerprint, that fingerprint
                represents a binding
                between the identity as established by TLS and that established
                via SDP. As previously noted, the fingerprint is vulnerable to
                an active MITM attack from any on-path proxy.
                Endpoints SHOULD
                therefore locally store fingerprints associated with the
                relevant identities when first seen and SHOULD provide a
                warning when a
                new fingerprint is seen for what otherwise appears to be the
                same peer identity. While there are valid reasons for keys
                to change from time to time, that ought to be the exception --
                hence the suggested warning.
            </t>
            <t>
                It should, however, be noted that using fingerprint-based authentication 
                over an insecure network increases the security compared to unencrypted 
                MSRP. In order to intercept the plaintext media when fingerprint-based 
                authentication is used, the attacker is required to be present on both 
                the signaling and media paths and actively modify the traffic. It is very 
                hard for the endpoints to detect when such an attack is taking place, though. 
                A client using DTLS-SRTP (a Secure Real-time Transport Protocol
(SRTP) extension for Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)) <xref
target="RFC5764" /> for Voice over IP (VoIP) media security might wish to use fingerprint-based authentication also for MSRP media security. 
            </t>
            <t>
                MSRPS with fingerprint-based authentication is vulnerable to attacks due to vulnerabilities in the SIP 
                signaling. If there are weaknesses in the integrity protections on the SIP signaling, an attacker may 
                insert malicious Middleboxes to alter, record, or otherwise harm the media. With insecure signaling, 
                it can be difficult for an endpoint to even be aware that the remote endpoint has any relationship to the 
                expected endpoint.  Securing the SIP signaling does not solve
all problems. For example, in a SIP Secure (SIPS) 
                environment, the endpoints have no cryptographic way of validating that one or more SIP proxies in the 
                proxy chain are not, in fact, malicious.
