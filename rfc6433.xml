<abstract>

<t>The IETF intends to provide a new tool to Working Group chairs and
Area Directors for the creation and updating of milestones for
Working Group charters. This document describes the requirements for the
proposed new tool, and it is intended as input to a later activity
for the design and development of such a tool. This document updates
RFC 6292.</t>

<section title="Introduction">

<t><xref target="RFC2418"/> describes the guidelines and procedures
for operation of IETF Working Groups (WGs). Every WG has milestones
that the WG is supposed to meet, such as the publication of a particular
Internet-Draft or the beginning of discussion on a particular topic.
A WG's charter has several parts; one of
those parts is the milestones.  Changing milestones currently requires
Area Director (AD) approval, but changing the charter text requires IESG approval.
</t>

<t>Today, the tasks associated with creating and updating WG
milestones are performed manually by the Secretariat. Normally, WG chairs send email to
their AD requesting that milestones be created or
updated. They send mail to the their AD, or directly to the Secretariat,
when one or more milestone has been met. 
Apart from during WG creation, these updates will be made
through a separate tool after the requirements in this document and 
in <xref target="RFC6292"/> are met.</t>

<t>In early 2011, the IETF approved a set of requirements for a tool
that helps ADs with the WG chartering and rechartering process <xref
target="RFC6292"/>. During the IESG discussion of that document,
it became clear that everyone wanted more automation to the
milestones process. This document is
intended to bring that discussion to a general consensus
for the requirements for the eventual tool.</t>

<t>Note that this document only discusses updating milestones that
an active WG is working against. As described in <xref
target="RFC6292"/>, when a WG is rechartering, the new charter might also
include new milestones. The tool described here must not change the
milestones that are proposed for a WG recharter. 
That is, there must be two sets of milestones kept by the Datatracker,
one for the current WG charter and one for a proposed
recharter; the tool described here must only affect the first of
these two sets.
</t>

<t>The IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) would like to create a better tool for the tasks of WG
milestone creation and updating, and this document lists the
requirements for such a tool. When complete, this document may be
used to issue an request for proposals for the design and development of the tool. This
document was prepared at the request of the IAOC.</t>

</section>

<section title="Users of the Tool" anchor="users">

<t>This tool can only be used by WG chairs and ADs, not by other members
of the IETF community. The tool will use the login and access control
features that will already be in place from the outcome of the tool
created by <xref target="RFC6292"/>. It is important to note
that some people are chairs for more than one WG, and everyone must be
able to use the tool for all of the WGs that they chair.</t>

<t>Any AD can add or update any milestone for any WG. Normally, an
AD would only add or update milestones in the WGs for which they are
the responsible AD, but ADs are not bound by such a limitation.
(This is the same model used in the Datatracker for other actions:
it allows one AD to carry the load for an AD who is temporarily unable
to perform such tasks.) WG
chairs can only add or update milestones for WGs of which they are
chairs.</t>

<t>The IETF Secretariat needs to be able to perform the same tasks as
the ADs in order to fix problems or to make emergency
changes.</t>

<t>The database will record the date and person who initiates
any addition of, or change to, a milestone. The contents of the database
will be visible to the IETF community so that anyone can see
who made a particular change to a milestone.</t>

</section>

<section title="Updating, Adding, and Deleting Milestones">

<t>A WG chair needs to see all of the milestones for that chair's WG
in the tool. The chair needs to be able to change any milestone
record for that chair's WG. In each existing record, the chair needs to be
able to change the due date, the finished date, the associated
Internet-Drafts, and the description of the milestone. The chair
also needs to be able to delete existing milestones.</t>

<t>A WG chair needs to be able to add one or more milestone records
to the database for their WG. The chair needs to be able to specify the
due date, zero or more associated Internet-Drafts, and the description of the
record that he or she is adding.</t>

</section>

<section title="Acceptance of Milestone Additions and Changes">

<t>There are six actions associated with adding and changing milestones:

<list style="symbols">

<t>create new milestones</t>

<t>delete milestones</t>

<t>change milestone descriptions</t>

<t>change milestone due dates</t>

<t>change which Internet-Drafts are associated with a milestone</t>

<t>assert that a milestone is no longer due</t>

</list></t>

<t>In addition to the above six actions, the tool must support reordering of the
list of milestones.</t>

<t>WG chairs can change milestone due dates, change which Internet-Drafts are
associated with a milestone, can assert that a milestone is no longer due, for
their WG, and reorder the list. When any of these three actions are taken in the Datatracker, an email
notification is sent to the AD for the WG as well as to the WG's chairs; the
changes are reflected immediately in the Datatracker without any need for
approval from an AD.</t>

<t>WG chairs can also create new milestones, delete milestones, and change
milestone descriptions; however, any of these action are not reflected in the
Datatracker until the action is approved by an AD. When a WG chair makes the
proposed change, an email notification is sent to the AD for the WG as well as
to the WG's chairs.</t>

<t>When creating a milestone, it must be possible to set a
due date. It must also be to change the due date at any time.</t>

<t>When asserting that a milestone is no longer due, it must be possible to
provide an arbitrary short description phrase. Often this phrase will be
"Done", but other phrases such as "On hold" are also allowed. 
When the Datatracker presents a milestone, the only information
that is expected to be associated with the provided phrase is 
that the milestone is no longer due.
 The
Datatracker will present the list of milestones in the order given in the
tool.</t>

<t>As noted in <xref target="users"/>, any AD can take any of these six actions, as
  well as reordering the list.
After this tool is launched, the IETF Secretariat will no longer
need to post a change to the database because the tool will do this without
intervention by the Secretariat; however, 
the Secretariat can take any of these six actions as well.</t>

<t>When adding or editing a milestone, the AD or WG Chair must be able to review
and change the proposed change before committing the change to the Datatracker.
This will help prevent errors and reduce the number of fixes that need to be
made.</t>

<t>Once a day, the Datatracker will look for changes to the milestones for a WG.
If changes to milestones have been made in the past 24 hours, the Datatracker will send one
message to the WG listing all the changes from that period.</t>

<t>The Datatracker needs to have a method for ADs and the Secretariat to see all the
milestones that are pending approval. This list should be sorted by
the responsible AD.</t>

</section>

<section title="Mapping Milestones to Internet-Drafts">

<t>There is currently no mechanism to map WG milestones to Internet-Drafts.
While most milestones map one-to-one with Internet-Drafts,
some milestones do not map to any Internet-Draft (such as those that
say when a general discussion will begin or finish), and other milestones map
to multiple Internet-Drafts (such as a milestone that covers a topic
that has multiple related Internet-Drafts).
Some Internet-Drafts are part of more than one milestone.</t>

<t>The new tool is required to make mappings between milestones
and Internet-Drafts explicit, and those drafts must be listed in
views of the milestone. This change will require a change
to the Datatracker database to make such an association.</t>

<t>When an Internet-Draft that is mapped to a milestone changes its state to "Submitted to IESG
for Publication" as described in <xref target="RFC6174"/>, the tool will send a message to the
WG chairs to remind them that they might want to update the milestone. Note that this message
will not apply to all Internet-Drafts that are mapped to a milestone, so it is up to the WG
chairs to decide what to do when such a message is received.</t>

</section>

<section title="Reminders for WG Chairs and ADs">

<t>Milestone changes that do not require AD approval are made immediately. Requested changes
that require AD approval are tracked by the tool. If the AD has not approved or rejected the
change within a week, email listing the request and the request date is sent to the WG chairs
and AD. That email is sent every week until the AD has approved or rejected the request;
the WG chairs are CC'd on this mail.</t>

<t>The tool will also send WG chairs reminders about pending milestones. A message is sent when
a milestone is one month from being due, at the time a milestone is due, and every month in
which a milestone is overdue.</t>

<t>The tool will also send WG chairs reminders about Internet-Drafts that are mapped to
milestones. A message is sent when such a draft is one month from expiring, and at the time
that a draft expires. If a milestone is mapped to a draft that is expired, mail reminding the
chairs of this will be sent weekly.</t>

<t>When a WG chair makes an Internet-Draft a WG work item, the Datatracker will remind
them that they may want to also add that document to a milestone.</t>

</section>

<section title="Viewing Changes in Milestones">

<t><xref target="RFC6292"/> describes an extension
to the Datatracker to allow the IETF community to view, search, and track
changes to WG charters.

 This document updates those requirements to
allow the IETF community to view, search, and track changes to
WG milestones.</t>

<t>Section 5.1 of <xref target="RFC6292"/> is updated to allow
searching for any text in a milestone's description, as well as for
the name of any Internet-Draft name that is mapped to any milestone.</t>

<t>A new capability will be added to the Datatracker that is similar to
that described in Section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC6292"/>, but
instead of showing differences between charters, it shows differences
between the full set of milestones. Any time a milestone is added, deleted,
or any of its fields changed, or the list is reordered, the full set of milestones is considered
changed. A user should be able to easily compare two full sets of milestones
with the differences highlighted.

The tool should
show who made each change when changes are viewed. These features should
be found in the same place as the features described in
Section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC6292"/>.</t>

<t>The tool needs to provide an Atom feed <xref target="RFC4287"/>
for the changes in the milestones for a WG. The contents of the feed
are the full WG record, plus an indication of what changed since the
last entry in the feed and who made the change. This feed is
different than the feed described in Section 5.3 of <xref
target="RFC6292"/>, but it should be offered to users in the
same places as that feed is offered.</t>

<t>When a milestone is marked as no longer due, the Datatracker will display the
month and year that this change was made and will display the
status (such as "Done" or "On hold").</t>

</section>

<section title='Security Considerations'>
<t>Creating a new tool for updating the milestones of WGs does not
affect the security of the Internet in any significant fashion.</t>
