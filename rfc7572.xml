    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
      <t>In order to help ensure interworking between instant messaging (IM) systems that conform to the instant messaging / presence requirements <xref target="RFC2779"/>, it is important to clearly define protocol mappings between such systems.  Within the IETF, work has proceeded on two instant messaging technologies:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Various extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (<xref target="RFC3261" />)
     for instant messaging, in particular the MESSAGE method extension
     <xref target="RFC3428" />; collectively the capabilities of SIP with these
     extensions are commonly called SIP for Instant Messaging and
     Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE).</t>


          <t>The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), which consists of a formalization of the core XML streaming protocols developed originally by the Jabber open-source community; the relevant specifications are <xref target='RFC6120'/> for the XML streaming layer and <xref target='RFC6121'/> for basic presence and instant messaging extensions.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>One approach to helping ensure interworking between these protocols
  is to map each protocol to the abstract semantics described in
  <xref target="RFC3860" />; that is the approach taken by <xref target="SIMPLE-CPIM" /> and <xref target="RFC3922" />.
  In contrast, the approach taken in this document is to directly map
  semantics from one protocol to another (i.e., from SIP / SIMPLE to
  XMPP and vice versa), since that is how existing systems solve the
  interworking problem.</t>

<t>
  Both XMPP systems and IM-capable SIP systems enable entities to
  exchange "instant messages".  The term "instant message" usually
  refers to a message sent between two entities for delivery in close
  to real time (rather than a message that is stored and forwarded to
  the intended recipient upon request).  This document specifies
  mappings only for single messages (sometimes called "pager-mode"
  messaging), since they form the lowest common denominator for IM.
  Separate documents cover "session-mode" instant messaging in the
  form of one-to-one chat sessions <xref target="RFC7573" /> and multi-party chat
  sessions <xref target="GROUPCHAT" />.  In particular, session-mode instant messaging
  supports several features that are not part of pager-mode instant
  messaging, such as a higher level of assurance regarding end-to-end
  message delivery.  As with all of these documents, the architectural
  assumptions underlying such direct mappings are provided in
  <xref target="RFC7247" />, including mapping of addresses and error conditions.
</t>

    <section title="Intended Audience" anchor="audience">
      <t>The documents in this series are intended for use by software developers who have an existing system based on one of these technologies (e.g., SIP) and who would like to enable communication from that existing system to systems based on the other technology (e.g., XMPP).  We assume that readers are familiar with the core specifications for both SIP <xref target='RFC3261'/> and XMPP <xref target='RFC6120'/>, with the base document for this series <xref target='RFC7247'/>, and with the following IM-related specifications:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Instant Messaging" <xref target='RFC3428'/></t>
          <t>"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Instant Messaging and Presence" <xref target='RFC6121'/></t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Note well that not all protocol-compliant messages are shown (such as SIP 100 TRYING messages), in order to focus the reader on the essential aspects of the protocol flows.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology" anchor="terms">
      <t>A number of terms used here are explained in <xref target='RFC3261'/>, <xref target='RFC3428'/>, <xref target='RFC6120'/>, and <xref target='RFC6121'/>.</t>
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target='RFC2119'/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="XMPP to SIP" anchor="xmpp2sip">
      <t>As described in <xref target="RFC6121"/>, a single instant message is an XML &lt;message/&gt; stanza of type "normal" sent over an XML stream (since "normal" is the default for the 'type' attribute of the &lt;message/&gt; stanza, the attribute is often omitted).</t>
      <t>When the XMPP user Juliet with a Jabber Identifier (JID) of &lt;juliet@example.com&gt; wants to send an instant message to Romeo, she interacts with her XMPP client, which generates an XMPP &lt;message/&gt; stanza.  The syntax of the &lt;message/&gt; stanza, including required and optional elements and attributes, is defined in <xref target="RFC6121"/> (for single instant messages, Section 5.1 of <xref target='RFC6121'/> recommends that the value of the 'to' address be a "bare JID" of the form "localpart@domainpart").  The following is an example of such a stanza:</t>

|    <body>Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?</body>
|  </message>
        ]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>Upon receiving such a message stanza, the XMPP server needs to determine the identity of the domainpart in the 'to' address, which it does by following the procedures explained in Section 5 of <xref target='RFC7247'/>.  If the domain is a SIP domain, the XMPP server will hand off the message stanza to an XMPP-to-SIP gateway or connection manager that natively communicates with IM-aware SIP servers.</t>
      <t>The XMPP-to-SIP gateway is then responsible for translating the XMPP message stanza into a SIP MESSAGE request from the XMPP user to the SIP user:</t>

    <section title="SIP to XMPP" anchor="sip2xmpp">
      <t>As described in <xref target="RFC3428"/>, a single instant message is a SIP MESSAGE request sent from a SIP user agent to an intended recipient who is most generally referenced by an Instant Messaging (IM) URI <xref target="RFC3861" /> of the form &lt;im:user@domain&gt; but who might be referenced by a SIP or SIPS URI of the form &lt;sip:user@domain&gt; or &lt;sips:user@domain&gt;.</t>
      <t>When a SIP user Romeo with a SIP URI of &lt;sip:romeo@example.net&gt; wants to send an instant message to Juliet, he interacts with his SIP user agent, which generates a SIP MESSAGE request.  The syntax of the MESSAGE request is defined in <xref target="RFC3428"/>.  The following is an example of such a request:</t>

      </figure>
      <t>Section 5 of <xref target="RFC3428"/> stipulates that a SIP user agent presented with an im: URI should resolve it to a sip: or sips: URI.  Therefore, we assume that the Request-URI of a request received by an IM-capable SIP-to-XMPP gateway will contain a sip: or sips: URI.  Upon receiving the MESSAGE, the SIP server needs to determine the identity of the domain portion of the Request-URI or To header, which it does by following the procedures explained in Section 5 of <xref target='RFC7247'/>.  If the domain is an XMPP domain, the SIP server will hand off the MESSAGE to an associated SIP-to-XMPP gateway or connection manager that natively communicates with XMPP servers.</t>
      <t>The SIP-to-XMPP gateway is then responsible for translating the request into an XMPP message stanza from the SIP user to the XMPP user and returning a SIP 200 OK message to the sender:</t>

        ]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>Note that the stanza-handling rules specified in <xref target='RFC6121'/> allow the receiving XMPP server to deliver a message stanza whose 'to' address is a bare JID ("localpart@domainpart") to multiple connected devices.  This is similar to the "forking" of messages in SIP.</t>
      <t>The mapping of SIP syntax to XMPP syntax MUST be as shown in the following table.</t>

      <t>See <xref target='content'/> of this document about the handling of SIP message bodies that contain content types other than plain text.</t>
    </section>

    <section title='Message Size' anchor="size">
      <t><xref target='RFC3428'/> specifies that (outside of a media session) the size of a MESSAGE request is not allowed to exceed 1300 bytes.  Although, in practice, XMPP instant messages do not often exceed that size, neither <xref target='RFC6120'/> nor <xref target='RFC6121'/> sets an upper limit on the size of XMPP stanzas.  However, XMPP server deployments usually do limit the size of stanzas in order to help prevent denial-of-service attacks, and <xref target='RFC6120'/> states that if a server sets a maximum stanza size, then the limit is not allowed to be less than 10,000 bytes.  Because of this mismatch, an XMPP-to-SIP gateway SHOULD return a &lt;policy-violation/&gt; stanza error if an XMPP user attempts to send an XMPP message stanza that would result in a SIP MESSAGE greater than 1300 bytes.  Although such a gateway might decide to "upgrade" from page mode to session mode using the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) -- thus treating the instant message as part of a chat session as described in <xref target='RFC7573'/> -- such behavior is application-specific and this document provides no guidelines for how to complete such an upgrade.</t>
    </section>

    <section title='Content Types' anchor="content">
      <t>SIP requests of type "MESSAGE" are allowed to contain essentially any content type.  The recommended procedures for SIP-to-XMPP gateways to use in handling these content types are as follows.</t>
      <t>An IM-aware SIP-to-XMPP gateway MUST process SIP messages that contain message bodies of type "text/plain" and MUST encapsulate such message bodies as the XML character data of the XMPP &lt;body/&gt; element.</t>
      <t>An IM-aware SIP-to-XMPP gateway SHOULD process SIP messages that contain message bodies of type "text/html"; if so, a gateway MUST transform the "text/html" content into XHTML content that conforms to the XHTML-IM Integration Set specified in <xref target='XEP-0071'/>.</t>
      <t>Although an IM-aware SIP-to-XMPP gateway MAY process SIP messages that contain message bodies of types other than "text/plain" and "text/html", the handling of such content types is a matter of implementation.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Internationalization Considerations" anchor="i18n">
      <t>Both XMPP and SIP support the UTF-8 encoding <xref target='RFC3629'/> of Unicode characters <xref target='UNICODE'/> within messages, along with tagging of the language for a particular message (in XMPP via the 'xml:lang' attribute and in SIP via the Content-Language header).  Gateways MUST map these language tagging mechanisms if they are present in the original message.  Several examples follow, using the "XML Notation" <xref target='RFC3987'/> for Unicode characters outside the ASCII range.</t>

      <t>Detailed security considerations are given in the following documents:

<t>For SIP-based instant messaging, see <xref target="RFC3428"/> and also <xref target="RFC3261"/></t>

      <t>This document specifies methods for exchanging "pager-mode" instant messages through a gateway that translates between SIP and XMPP, and <xref target='RFC7573'/> specifies such methods for "session-mode" instant messaging between MSRP and XMPP.  Such a gateway MUST be compliant with the minimum security requirements of the textual chat protocols for which it translates (i.e., SIP or MSRP and XMPP).</t>
      <t>The addition of gateways to the security model of instant messaging specified in <xref target="RFC2779"/> introduces some new risks.  In particular, end-to-end security properties (especially confidentiality and integrity) between instant messaging clients that interface through a gateway can be provided only if common formats are supported.  Specification of those common formats is out of scope for this document.  For instant messages, it is possible to use the methods described in <xref target="RFC3862"/> and <xref target='RFC3923'/>, but those methods are not widely implemented.  A more widely implemented, albeit unstandardized, method for interoperable end-to-end encryption would be Off-the-Record Messaging <xref target='OTR'/>.</t>
