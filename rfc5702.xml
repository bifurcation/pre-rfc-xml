               <t>
                   The Domain Name System (DNS) is the global, hierarchical
                   distributed database for Internet Naming. The
                   DNS has been extended to use cryptographic keys
                   and digital signatures for the verification of the
                   authenticity and integrity of its data.  <xref target="RFC4033"/>,  <xref target="RFC4034"/>,
                   and <xref target="RFC4035"/> describe these
                   DNS Security Extensions, called DNSSEC.

                   RFC 4034 describes how to store DNSKEY and RRSIG
                   resource records, and specifies a list of cryptographic
                   algorithms to use. This document extends that list
                   with the algorithms RSA/SHA-256 and RSA/SHA-512, and
                   specifies how to store DNSKEY data and how to produce
                   RRSIG resource records with these hash algorithms.
               </t> <t>
                   Familiarity with DNSSEC, RSA, and the SHA-2 <xref
                   target="FIPS.180-3.2008" /> family of algorithms is
                   assumed in this document.
               </t> <t>
                   To refer to both SHA-256 and SHA-512, this document
                   will use the name SHA-2. This is done to improve
                   readability. When a part of text is specific for
                   either SHA-256 or SHA-512, their specific names are
                   used. The same goes for RSA/SHA-256 and RSA/SHA-512,
                   which will be grouped using the name RSA/SHA-2.
                   </t>
                   <t>
                   The term "SHA-2" is not officially defined but is usually
                   used to refer to the collection of the algorithms SHA-224,
                   SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. Since SHA-224 and SHA-384 are not
                   used in DNSSEC, SHA-2 will only refer to 
                   SHA-256 and SHA-512 in this document.

                "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
                document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.

                   follows the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 signature scheme and
                   is calculated as follows. The values for the RDATA
                   fields that precede the signature data are

                   Here XXX is either 256 or 512, depending on the
                   algorithm used, as specified in FIPS PUB 180-3; "data" is
                   the wire format data of the resource record set

                   are fixed octets of corresponding hexadecimal value;
                   "e" is the private exponent of the signing RSA key;
                   and "n" is the public modulus of the signing key. The
                   FF octet MUST be repeated the exact number of times

                versus SHA-2 Considerations for RRSIG Resource Records">
                   <t>
                        Users of DNSSEC are encouraged to deploy SHA-2 as
                        soon as software implementations allow for it.
                        SHA-2 is widely believed to be more resilient
                        to attack than SHA-1, and confidence in SHA-1's
                        strength is being eroded by recently announced
                        attacks.  Regardless of whether or not the attacks
                        on SHA-1 will affect DNSSEC, it is believed
                        (at the time of this writing) that SHA-2 is the
                        better choice for use in DNSSEC records.
                   </t> <t>
                        SHA-2 is considered sufficiently strong for the
                        immediate future, but predictions about future
                        development in cryptography and cryptanalysis
                        are beyond the scope of this document.
                   </t> <t>
                     The signature scheme RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 is chosen to
                     match the one used for RSA/SHA-1 signatures. This
                     should ease implementation of the new hashing
                     algorithms in DNSSEC software.

                    <t>
                        Since each RRSet MUST be signed with each
                        algorithm present in the DNSKEY RRSet at the
                        zone apex (see Section 2.2 of
                        <xref target="RFC4035"/>), a malicious party
                        cannot filter out the
                        RSA/SHA-2 RRSIG and force the validator to use
                        the RSA/SHA-1 signature if both are present in
                        the zone. This should provide resilience against
                        algorithm downgrade attacks, if the validator
                        supports RSA/SHA-2.
