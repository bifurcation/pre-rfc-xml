    <abstract><t>The Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface (GSS&nbhy;API)
offers application programmers uniform access to security services
atop a variety of underlying cryptographic mechanisms.  This document
updates the Java bindings for the GSS-API that are specified in
"Generic Security Service API Version 2: Java Bindings Update"
(RFC 5653).  This document obsoletes RFC 5653 by adding a new output
token field to the GSSException class so that when the initSecContext
or acceptSecContext methods of the GSSContext class fail, it has
a chance to emit an error token that can be sent to the peer for
debugging or informational purpose. The stream-based GSSContext methods
are also removed in this version.
</t>
<t>The GSS-API is described at a language-independent conceptual level in
"Generic Security Service Application Program Interface Version 2,
Update 1" (RFC 2743).  The GSS-API allows a caller application to
authenticate a principal identity, to delegate rights to a peer, and
to apply security services such as confidentiality and integrity on a
per-message basis.  Examples of security mechanisms defined for
GSS&nbhy;API are "The Simple Public-Key GSS-API Mechanism (SPKM)" (RFC 2025) and
"The Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service Application Program
Interface (GSS-API) Mechanism: Version 2" (RFC 4121).

<section title="Introduction" anchor="x1">
<t>This document specifies Java language bindings for the Generic
Security Services Application Programming Interface
(GSS-API) version 2.  GSS-API version 2 is described in a language-independent
format in RFC 2743 <xref target="RFC2743"/>.  The GSS-API allows a caller
application to authenticate a principal identity, delegate rights
to a peer, and apply security services such as confidentiality and
integrity on a per-message basis.
</t>
<t>This document and its predecessors, RFC 2853 <xref target="RFC2853"/> and RFC 5653 <xref target="RFC5653"/>, leverage the
work done by the working group (WG) in the area of RFC 2743 <xref target="RFC2743"/>
and the C-bindings of RFC 2744 <xref target="RFC2744"/>.  Whenever appropriate, text
has been used from the C-bindings document (RFC 2744) to explain
generic concepts and provide direction to the implementors.
</t>
<t>The design goals of this API have been to satisfy all the
functionality defined in RFC 2743 <xref target="RFC2743"/> and to provide
these services in an object-oriented method.  The specification also
aims to satisfy the needs of both types of Java application
developers, those who would like access to a "system-wide" GSS-API
implementation, as well as those who would want to provide their own
"custom" implementation.
</t>
<t>A system-wide implementation is one that is available to all
applications in the form of a library package.  It may be the
standard package in the Java runtime environment (JRE) being used, or
it may be additionally installed and accessible to any application
via the CLASSPATH.
</t>
<t>A custom implementation of the GSS-API, on the other hand, is one
that would, in most cases, be bundled with the application during
distribution.  It is expected that such an implementation would be
meant to provide for some particular need of the application, such as
support for some specific mechanism.
</t>
<t>The design of this API also aims to provide a flexible framework to
add and manage GSS-API mechanisms.  GSS-API leverages the Java
Cryptography Architecture (JCA) provider model to support the
plugability of mechanisms.  Mechanisms can be added on a system-wide
basis, where all users of the framework will have them available.  The
specification also allows for the addition of mechanisms per instance
of the GSS-API.
</t>
<t>Lastly, this specification presents an API that will naturally fit
within the operation environment of the Java platform.  Readers are
assumed to be familiar with both the GSS-API and the Java platform.

</t>
</section> 
<section title="GSS-API Operational Paradigm" anchor="x3"> 
<t>"Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface, Version
2" <xref target="RFC2743"/> defines a generic security API to calling
applications.  It allows a communicating application to authenticate
the user associated with another application, to delegate rights to
another application, and to apply security services such as
confidentiality and integrity on a per-message basis.
</t>
<t>There are four stages to using GSS-API:
</t>
<t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="3"><t hangText="1)">The application acquires a set of credentials with which it may
prove its identity to other processes.  The application's credentials
vouch for its global identity, which may or may not be related to any
local username under which it may be running.
</t>
<t hangText="2)">A pair of communicating applications establish a joint security
context using their credentials.  The security context encapsulates
shared state information, which is required in order that per-message
security services may be provided.  Examples of state information
that might be shared between applications as part of a security
context are cryptographic keys and message sequence numbers.  As
part of the establishment of a security context, the context
initiator is authenticated to the responder and may require that the
responder is authenticated back to the initiator.  The initiator may
optionally give the responder the right to initiate further security
contexts, acting as an agent or delegate of the initiator.  This
transfer of rights is termed "delegation" and is achieved by
creating a set of credentials, similar to those used by the
initiating application, but which may be used by the responder.
</t>
<t>A GSSContext object is used to establish and maintain the shared
information that makes up the security context.  Certain GSSContext
methods will generate a token, which applications treat as
cryptographically protected, opaque data.  The caller of such a
GSSContext method is responsible for transferring the token to the
peer application, encapsulated if necessary in an application-to-
application protocol.  On receipt of such a token, the peer
application should pass it to a corresponding GSSContext method, which
will decode the token and extract the information, updating the
security context state information accordingly.
</t>
<t hangText="3)">Per-message services are invoked on a GSSContext object to apply
either:
</t>
<t>integrity and data origin authentication, or
</t>
<t>confidentiality, integrity, and data origin authentication
</t>
<t>to application data, which are treated by GSS-API as arbitrary
octet strings.  An application transmitting a message that it wishes
to protect will call the appropriate GSSContext method (getMIC or
wrap) to apply protection before sending the resulting token to the
receiving application.  The receiver will pass the received token
(and, in the case of data protected by getMIC, the accompanying
message data) to the corresponding decoding method of the GSSContext
interface (verifyMIC or unwrap) to remove the protection and validate
the data.
</t>
<t hangText="4)">At the completion of a communications session (which may extend
across several transport connections), each application uses a
GSSContext method to invalidate the security context and release any
system or cryptographic resources held.  Multiple contexts may also
be used (either successively or simultaneously) within a single
communications association, at the discretion of the applications.
</t>
</list></t>
</section> 
<section title="Additional Controls" anchor="x4">
<t>This section discusses the OPTIONAL services that a context initiator
may request of the GSS-API before the context establishment.  Each of
these services is requested by calling the appropriate mutator method
in the GSSContext object before the first call to init is performed.
Only the context initiator can request context flags.
</t>
<t>The OPTIONAL services defined are:
</t>
<t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="3"><t>Delegation: The (usually temporary) transfer of rights from
initiator to acceptor, enabling the acceptor to authenticate
itself as an agent of the initiator.
</t>
<t>Mutual Authentication: In addition to the initiator authenticating
its identity to the context acceptor, the context acceptor SHOULD
also authenticate itself to the initiator.
</t>
<t>Replay Detection: In addition to providing message integrity
services, GSSContext per-message operations of getMIC and wrap
SHOULD include message numbering information to enable verifyMIC
and unwrap to detect if a message has been duplicated.
</t>
<t>Out-of-Sequence Detection: In addition to providing message
integrity services, GSSContext per-message operations (getMIC and
wrap) SHOULD include message sequencing information to enable
verifyMIC and unwrap to detect if a message has been received out
of sequence.
</t>
<t>Anonymous Authentication: The establishment of the security context
SHOULD NOT reveal the initiator's identity to the context
acceptor.
</t>
</list></t>
<t>Some mechanisms may not support all OPTIONAL services, and some
mechanisms may only support some services in conjunction with others.
The GSSContext interface offers query methods to allow the
verification by the calling application of which services will be
available from the context when the establishment phase is complete.
In general, if the security mechanism is capable of providing a
requested service, it SHOULD do so even if additional services must
be enabled in order to provide the requested service.  If the
mechanism is incapable of providing a requested service, it SHOULD
proceed without the service leaving the application to abort the
context establishment process if it considers the requested service
to be mandatory.
</t>
<t>Some mechanisms MAY specify that support for some services is
optional and that implementors of the mechanism need not provide it.
This is most commonly true of the confidentiality service, often
because of legal restrictions on the use of data encryption, but it may
apply to any of the services.  Such mechanisms are required to send
at least one token from acceptor to initiator during context
establishment when the initiator indicates a desire to use such a
service, so that the initiating GSS-API can correctly indicate
whether the service is supported by the acceptor's GSS-API.
</t>
<section title="Delegation" anchor="x4.1"> 
<t>The GSS-API allows delegation to be controlled by the initiating
application via the requestCredDeleg method before the first call to
init has been issued.  Some mechanisms do not support delegation, and
for such mechanisms, attempts by an application to enable delegation
are ignored.
</t>
<t>The acceptor of a security context, for which the initiator enabled
delegation, can check if delegation was enabled by using the
getCredDelegState method of the GSSContext interface.  In cases when
it is enabled, the delegated credential object can be obtained by
calling the getDelegCred method.  The obtained GSSCredential object
may then be used to initiate subsequent GSS-API security contexts as
an agent or delegate of the initiator.  If the original initiator's
identity is "A" and the delegate's identity is "B", then, depending on
the underlying mechanism, the identity embodied by the delegated
credential may be either "A" or "B acting for A".
</t>
<t>For many mechanisms that support delegation, a simple boolean does
not provide enough control.  Examples of additional aspects of
delegation control that a mechanism might provide to an application
are duration of delegation, network addresses from which delegation
is valid, and constraints on the tasks that may be performed by a
delegate.  Such controls are presently outside the scope of the
GSS&nbhy;API.  GSS-API implementations supporting mechanisms offering
additional controls SHOULD provide extension routines that allow
these controls to be exercised (perhaps by modifying the initiator's
GSS-API credential object prior to its use in establishing a
context).  However, the simple delegation control provided by GSS-API
SHOULD always be able to override other mechanism-specific
delegation controls.  If the application instructs the GSSContext
object that delegation is not desired, then the implementation MUST
NOT permit delegation to occur.  This is an exception to the general
rule that a mechanism may enable services even if they are not
requested -- delegation may only be provided at the explicit request
of the application.
</t>
</section> 
<section title="Mutual Authentication" anchor="x4.2"> 
<t>Usually, a context acceptor will require that a context initiator
authenticate itself so that the acceptor may make an access-control
decision prior to performing a service for the initiator.  In some
cases, the initiator may also request that the acceptor authenticate
itself.  GSS-API allows the initiating application to request this
mutual authentication service by calling the requestMutualAuth method
of the GSSContext interface with a "true" parameter before making the
first call to init.  The initiating application is informed as to
whether or not the context acceptor has authenticated itself.  Note
that some mechanisms may not support mutual authentication, and other
mechanisms may always perform mutual authentication, whether or not
the initiating application requests it.  In particular, mutual
authentication may be required by some mechanisms in order to support
replay or out-of-sequence message detection, and for such mechanisms,
a request for either of these services will automatically enable
mutual authentication.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Replay and Out-of-Sequence Detection" anchor="x4.3">
<t>The GSS-API MAY provide detection of mis-ordered messages once a
security context has been established.  Protection MAY be applied to
messages by either application, by calling either getMIC or wrap
methods of the GSSContext interface, and verified by the peer
application by calling verifyMIC or unwrap for the peer's GSSContext
object.
</t>
<t>The getMIC method calculates a cryptographic checksum (authentication tag) of an
application message, and returns that checksum in a token.  The
application SHOULD pass both the token and the message to the peer
application, which presents them to the verifyMIC method of the
peer's GSSContext object.
</t>
<t>The wrap method calculates a cryptographic checksum of an application
message, and places both the checksum and the message inside a single
token.  The application SHOULD pass the token to the peer
application, which presents it to the unwrap method of the peer's
GSSContext object to extract the message and verify the checksum.
</t>
<t>Either pair of routines may be capable of detecting out-of-sequence
message delivery or the duplication of messages.  Details of such
mis-ordered messages are indicated through supplementary query methods
of the MessageProp object that is filled in by each of these routines.
</t>
<t>A mechanism need not maintain a list of all tokens that have been
processed in order to support these status codes.  A typical
mechanism might retain information about only the most recent "N"
tokens processed, allowing it to distinguish duplicates and missing
tokens within the most recent "N" messages; the receipt of a token
older than the most recent "N" would result in the isOldToken method
of the instance of MessageProp to return "true".
</t>
</section> 
<section title="Anonymous Authentication" anchor="x4.4"> 
<t>In certain situations, an application may wish to initiate the
authentication process to authenticate a peer, without revealing its
own identity.  As an example, consider an application providing
access to a database containing medical information and offering
unrestricted access to the service.  A client of such a service might
wish to authenticate the service (in order to establish trust in any
information retrieved from it), but might not wish the service to be
able to obtain the client's identity (perhaps due to privacy concerns
about the specific inquiries, or perhaps simply to avoid being placed
on mailing-lists).
</t>
<t>In normal use of the GSS-API, the initiator's identity is made
available to the acceptor as a result of the context establishment
process.  However, context initiators may request that their identity
not be revealed to the context acceptor.  Many mechanisms do not
support anonymous authentication, and for such mechanisms, the request
will not be honored.  An authentication token will still be
generated, but the application is always informed if a requested
service is unavailable, and has the option to abort context
establishment if anonymity is valued above the other security
services that would require a context to be established.
</t>
<t>In addition to informing the application that a context is
established anonymously (via the isAnonymous method of the GSSContext
class), the getSrcName method of the acceptor's GSSContext object
will, for such contexts, return a reserved internal-form name,
defined by the implementation.
</t>
<t>The toString method for a GSSName object representing an anonymous
entity will return a printable name.  The returned value will be
syntactically distinguishable from any valid principal name supported
by the implementation.  The associated name-type Object Identifier (OID)
will be an OID representing the value of NT_ANONYMOUS.  This name-type
OID will be defined as a public, static Oid object of the
GSSName class.  The printable form of an anonymous name SHOULD be
chosen such that it implies anonymity, since this name may appear in,
for example, audit logs.  For example, the string "&lt;anonymous&gt;" might
be a good choice, if no valid printable names supported by the
implementation can begin with "&lt;" and end with "&gt;".
</t>
<t>When using the equal method of the GSSName interface, and one of the
operands is a GSSName instance representing an anonymous entity, the
method MUST return "false".
</t>
</section> 
<section title="Integrity and Confidentiality" anchor="x4.5"> 
<t>If a GSSContext supports the integrity service, the getMic method may be
used to create message integrity check tokens on application messages.
</t>
<t>If a GSSContext supports the confidentiality service, the wrap method may
be used to encrypt application messages.  Messages are selectively
encrypted, under the control of the setPrivacy method of the
MessageProp object used in the wrap method. Confidentiality will be
applied if the privacy state is set to true.
</t>
</section> 
<section title="Inter-process Context Transfer" anchor="x4.6"> 
<t>GSS-APIv2 provides functionality that allows a security context to
be transferred between processes on a single machine.  These are
implemented using the export method of GSSContext and a byte array
constructor of the same class.  The most common use for such a
feature is a client-server design where the server is implemented as
a single process that accepts incoming security contexts, which then
launches child processes to deal with the data on these contexts.  In
such a design, the child processes must have access to the security
context object created within the parent so that they can use per-
message protection services and delete the security context when the
communication session ends.
</t>
<t>Since the security context data structure is expected to contain
sequencing information, it is impractical in general to share a
context between processes.  Thus, the GSSContext interface provides an
export method that the process, which currently owns the context, can
call to declare that it has no intention to use the context
subsequently and to create an inter-process token containing
information needed by the adopting process to successfully recreate
the context.  After successful completion of export, the original
security context is made inaccessible to the calling process by
GSS&nbhy;API, and any further usage of this object will result in failures.
The originating process transfers the inter-process token to the
adopting process, which creates a new GSSContext object using the
byte array constructor.  The properties of the context are equivalent
to that of the original context.
</t>
<t>The inter-process token MAY contain sensitive data from the original
security context (including cryptographic keys).  Applications using
inter-process tokens to transfer security contexts MUST take
appropriate steps to protect these tokens in transit.
</t>
<t>Implementations are not required to support the inter-process
transfer of security contexts.  Calling the isTransferable method of
the GSSContext interface will indicate if the context object is
transferable.
</t>
</section> 
<section title="The Use of Incomplete Contexts" anchor="x4.7"> 
<t>Some mechanisms may allow the per-message services to be used before
the context establishment process is complete.  For example, a
mechanism may include sufficient information in its initial context-
level tokens for the context acceptor to immediately decode messages
protected with wrap or getMIC.  For such a mechanism, the initiating
application need not wait until subsequent context-level tokens have
been sent and received before invoking the per-message protection
services.
</t>
<t>An application can invoke the isProtReady method of the GSSContext
class to determine if the per-message services are available in
advance of complete context establishment.  Applications wishing to
use per-message protection services on partially established contexts
SHOULD query this method before attempting to invoke wrap or getMIC.
</t>
</section> 
</section> 
<section title="Calling Conventions" anchor="x5"> 
<t>Java provides the implementors with not just a syntax for the
language but also an operational environment.  For example, memory
is automatically managed and does not require application
intervention.  These language features have allowed for a simpler API
and have led to the elimination of certain GSS-API functions.
</t>
<t>Moreover, the JCA defines a provider model that allows for
implementation-independent access to security services.  Using this
model, applications can seamlessly switch between different
implementations and dynamically add new services.  The GSS-API
specification leverages these concepts by the usage of providers for
the mechanism implementations.
</t>
<section title="Package Name" anchor="x5.1">
<t>The classes and interfaces defined in this document reside in the
package called "org.ietf.jgss".  Applications that wish to make use
of this API should import this package name as shown in Section <xref target="x8" format="counter"/>.
</t>
</section> 
<section title="Provider Framework" anchor="x5.2">
<t>Java security APIs use a provider architecture that allows
applications to be implementation independent and security API
implementations to be modular and extensible.  The
java.security.Provider class is an abstract class that a vendor
extends.  This class maps various properties that represent different
security services that are available to the names of the actual
vendor classes that implement those services.  When requesting a
service, an application simply specifies the desired provider, and the
API delegates the request to service classes available from that
provider.
</t>
<t>Using the Java security provider model insulates applications from
implementation details of the services they wish to use.
Applications can switch between providers easily, and new providers
can be added as needed, even at runtime.
</t>
<t>The GSS-API may use providers to find components for specific
underlying security mechanisms.  For instance, a particular provider
might contain components that will allow the GSS-API to support the
Kerberos v5 mechanism <xref target="RFC4121"/>, and another might contain components
to support the Simple Public-Key GSS-API Mechanism (SPKM) <xref target="RFC2025"/>.
By delegating mechanism-specific functionality to the components
obtained from providers, the GSS-API can be extended to support an
arbitrary list of mechanisms.
</t>
<t>How the GSS-API locates and queries these providers is beyond the
scope of this document and is being deferred to a Service Provider
Interface (SPI) specification.  The availability of such an SPI
specification is not mandatory for the adoption of this API
specification nor is it mandatory to use providers in the
implementation of a GSS-API framework.  However, by using the
provider framework together with an SPI specification, one can create
an extensible and implementation-independent GSS-API framework.
</t>
</section> 
<section title="Integer Types" anchor="x5.3">
<t>All numeric values are declared as the "int" primitive Java type.  The
Java specification guarantees that this will be a 32-bit two's
complement signed number.
</t>
<t>Throughout this API, the "boolean" primitive Java type is used
wherever a boolean value is required or returned.
</t>
</section> 
<section title="Opaque Data Types" anchor="x5.4"> 
<t>Java byte arrays are used to represent opaque data types that are
consumed and produced by the GSS-API in the form of tokens.  Java
arrays contain a length field that enables the users to easily
determine their size.  The language has automatic garbage collection
that alleviates the need by developers to release memory and
simplifies buffer ownership issues.
</t>
</section> 
<section title="Strings" anchor="x5.5"> 
<t>The String object will be used to represent all textual data.  The
Java String object transparently treats all characters as two-byte
Unicode characters, which allows support for many locals.  All
routines returning or accepting textual data will use the String
object.
</t>
</section> 
<section title="Object Identifiers" anchor="x5.6"> 

<t>An Oid object will be used to represent Universal Object Identifiers (OIDs).  OIDs are ISO-defined, hierarchically globally interpretable
identifiers used within the GSS-API framework to identify security
mechanisms and name formats.  The Oid object can be created from a
string representation of its dot notation (e.g., "1.3.6.1.5.6.2") as
well as from its ASN.1 DER encoding.  Methods are also provided to
test equality and provide the DER representation for the object.
</t>
<t>An important feature of the Oid class is that its instances are
immutable -- i.e., there are no methods defined that allow one to
change the contents of an Oid object.  This property allows one to treat
these objects as "statics" without the need to perform copies.
</t>
<t>Certain routines allow the usage of a default OID.  A "null" value
can be used in those cases.
</t>
</section> 
<section title="Object Identifier Sets" anchor="x5.7"> 
<t>The Java bindings represent Object Identifier sets as arrays of Oid
objects.  All Java arrays contain a length field, which allows for
easy manipulation and reference.
</t>
<t>In order to support the full functionality of RFC 2743
<xref target="RFC2743"/>, the Oid class includes a method that checks for
existence of an Oid object within a specified array.  This is
equivalent in functionality to gss_test_oid_set_member.  The use of
Java arrays and Java's automatic garbage collection has eliminated
the need for the following routines: gss_create_empty_oid_set,
gss_release_oid_set, and gss_add_oid_set_member.  Java GSS-API
implementations will not contain them.  Java's automatic garbage
collection and the immutable property of the Oid object eliminates
the memory management issues of the C counterpart.

<section title="Credentials" anchor="x5.8"> 
<t>GSS-API credentials are represented by the GSSCredential interface.
The interface contains several constructs to allow for the creation
of most common credential objects for the initiator and the acceptor.
Comparisons are performed using the interface's "equals" method.

The
following general description of GSS-API credentials is included from
the C-bindings specification <xref target="RFC2744"/>:
</t>
<!--Begin DNE text-->
<t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="3"><t>GSS-API credentials can contain mechanism-specific principal
authentication data for multiple mechanisms.  A GSS-API credential is
composed of a set of credential-elements, each of which is applicable
to a single mechanism.  A credential may contain at most one
credential-element for each supported mechanism.  A credential-element
identifies the data needed by a single mechanism to authenticate a
single principal, and conceptually contains two credential-references
that describe the actual mechanism-specific authentication data, one
to be used by GSS-API for initiating contexts, and one to be used for
accepting contexts.  For mechanisms that do not distinguish between
acceptor and initiator credentials, both references would point to the
same underlying mechanism-specific authentication data.
</t>
</list></t>
<!--End DNE text-->
<t>Credentials describe a set of mechanism-specific principals and give
their holder the ability to act as any of those principals.  All
principal identities asserted by a single GSS-API credential SHOULD
belong to the same entity, although enforcement of this property is
an implementation-specific matter.  A single GSSCredential object
represents all the credential elements that have been acquired.
</t>
<t>The creation of a GSSContext object allows the value of "null" to
be specified as the GSSCredential input parameter.  This will
indicate a desire by the application to act as a default principal.
While individual GSS-API implementations are free to determine such
default behavior as appropriate to the mechanism, the following
default behavior by these routines is RECOMMENDED for portability:
</t>
<t>For the initiator side of the context:
</t>
<t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="3"><t hangText="1)">If there is only a single principal capable of initiating security
contexts for the chosen mechanism that the application is authorized
to act on behalf of, then that principal shall be used; otherwise,
</t>
<t hangText="2)">If the platform maintains a concept of a default network identity
for the chosen mechanism, and if the application is authorized to act
on behalf of that identity for the purpose of initiating security
contexts, then the principal corresponding to that identity shall be
used; otherwise,
</t>
<t hangText="3)">If the platform maintains a concept of a default local identity,
and provides a means to map local identities into network identities
for the chosen mechanism, and if the application is authorized to act
on behalf of the network-identity image of the default local
identity for the purpose of initiating security contexts using the
chosen mechanism, then the principal corresponding to that identity
shall be used; otherwise,
</t>
<t hangText="4)">A user-configurable default identity should be used.
</t>
</list></t>
<t>For the acceptor side of the context:
</t>
<t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="3"><t hangText="1)">If there is only a single authorized principal identity capable of
accepting security contexts for the chosen mechanism, then that
principal shall be used; otherwise,
</t>
<t hangText="2)">If the mechanism can determine the identity of the target
principal by examining the context-establishment token processed
during the accept method, and if the accepting application is
authorized to act as that principal for the purpose of accepting
security contexts using the chosen mechanism, then that principal
identity shall be used; otherwise,
</t>
<t hangText="3)">If the mechanism supports context acceptance by any principal, and
if mutual authentication was not requested, any principal that the
application is authorized to accept security contexts under using the
chosen mechanism may be used; otherwise,
</t>
<t hangText="4)">A user-configurable default identity shall be used.
</t>
</list></t>
<t>The purpose of the above rules is to allow security contexts to be
established by both initiator and acceptor using the default behavior
whenever possible.  Applications requesting default behavior are
likely to be more portable across mechanisms and implementations than
ones that instantiate a GSSCredential object representing a specific
identity.
</t>
</section> 
<section title="Contexts" anchor="x5.9"> 
<t>The GSSContext interface is used to represent one end of a GSS-API
security context, storing state information appropriate to that end
of the peer communication, including cryptographic state information.
The instantiation of the context object is done differently by the
initiator and the acceptor.  After the context has been instantiated,
the initiator MAY choose to set various context options that will
determine the characteristics of the desired security context.  When
all the application-desired characteristics have been set, the
initiator will call the initSecContext method, which will produce a
token for consumption by the peer's acceptSecContext method.  It is
the responsibility of the application to deliver the authentication
token(s) between the peer applications for processing.  Upon
completion of the context-establishment phase, context attributes can
be retrieved, by both the initiator and acceptor, using the accessor
methods.  These will reflect the actual attributes of the established
context and might not match the initiator-requested values.  If any
retrieved attribute does not match the desired value
but it is necessary for the application protocol, the application SHOULD
destroy the security context and not use it for application traffic.
Otherwise, at this point, the context can be used by the application to
apply cryptographic services to its data.
</t>
</section> 
<section title="Authentication Tokens" anchor="x5.10">
<t>A token is a caller-opaque type that GSS-API uses to maintain
synchronization between each end of the GSS-API security context.
The token is a cryptographically protected octet string, generated by
the underlying mechanism at one end of a GSS-API security context for
use by the peer mechanism at the other end.  Encapsulation (if
required) within the application protocol and transfer of the token
are the responsibility of the peer applications.
</t>
<t>Java GSS-API uses byte arrays to represent authentication tokens.
</t>
</section> 
<section title="Inter-process Tokens" anchor="x5.11"> 
<t>Certain GSS-API routines are intended to transfer data between
processes in multi-process programs.  These routines use a caller-opaque octet string, generated by the GSS-API in one process for use
by the GSS-API in another process.  The calling application is
responsible for transferring such tokens between processes.  Note
that, while GSS-API implementors are encouraged to avoid placing
sensitive information within inter-process tokens, or to
cryptographically protect them, many implementations will be unable
to avoid placing key material or other sensitive data within them.
It is the application's responsibility to ensure that inter-process
tokens are protected in transit and transferred only to processes
that are trustworthy.  An inter-process token is represented using a
byte array emitted from the export method of the GSSContext
interface.  The receiver of the inter-process token would initialize
a GSSContext object with this token to create a new context.  Once a
context has been exported, the GSSContext object is invalidated and
is no longer available.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Error Reporting" anchor="x5.12"> 
<t>RFC 2743 <xref target="RFC2743"/> defined the usage of major and minor
status values for the signaling of GSS-API errors.  The major code, also
called the GSS status code, is used to signal errors at the GSS-API level,
independent of the underlying mechanism(s).  The minor status value
or Mechanism status code, is a mechanism-defined error value
indicating a mechanism-specific error code.
</t>
<t>Java GSS-API uses exceptions implemented by the GSSException class to
signal both minor and major error values.  Both mechanism-specific
errors and GSS-API level errors are signaled through instances of
this class.  The usage of exceptions replaces the need for major and
minor codes to be used within the API calls.  The GSSException class also
contains methods to obtain textual representations for both the major
and minor values, which is equivalent to the functionality of
gss_display_status.  A GSSException object MAY also include an output
token that SHOULD be sent to the peer.
</t>
<t>If an exception is thrown during context establishment, the context
negotiation has failed and the GSSContext object MUST be abandoned.
If it is thrown in a per-message call, the context MAY remain useful.
</t>
<section title="GSS Status Codes" anchor="x5.12.1">
<t>GSS status codes indicate errors that are independent of the
underlying mechanism(s) used to provide the security service.  The
errors that can be indicated via a GSS status code are generic API
routine errors (errors that are defined in the GSS-API
specification).  These bindings take advantage of the Java exceptions
mechanism, thus eliminating the need for calling errors.
</t>
<t>A GSS status code indicates a single fatal generic API error from the
routine that has thrown the GSSException.  Using exceptions announces
that a fatal error has occurred during the execution of the method.
The GSS-API operational model also allows for the signaling of
supplementary status information from the per-message calls.  These
need to be handled as return values since using exceptions is not
appropriate for informatory or warning-like information.  The methods
that are capable of producing supplementary information are the two
per-message methods GSSContext.verifyMIC() and GSSContext.unwrap().
These methods fill the supplementary status codes in the MessageProp
object that was passed in.
</t>
<t>A GSSException object, along with providing the functionality for
setting the various error codes and translating them into textual
representation, also contains the definitions of all the numeric
error values.  The following table lists the definitions of error
codes:

<t>A default value of 0 in either the GSSException object or the

<t>Supplementary status codes are confined to the per-message methods of
the GSSContext interface.  Because of the informative nature of these
errors, it is not appropriate to use exceptions to signal them.
Instead, the per-message operations of the GSSContext interface
return these values in a MessageProp object.

</section> 
</section>
<section title="Names" anchor="x5.13"> 
<t>A name is used to identify a person or entity.  GSS-API authenticates
the relationship between a name and the entity claiming the name.
</t>
<t>Since different authentication mechanisms may employ different
namespaces for identifying their principals, GSS-API's naming support
is necessarily complex in multi-mechanism environments (or even in
some single-mechanism environments where the underlying mechanism
supports multiple namespaces).
</t>
<t>Two distinct conceptual representations are defined for names:
</t>
<t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="3"><t hangText="1)">A GSS-API form represented by implementations of the GSSName
interface: A single GSSName object MAY contain multiple names from
different namespaces, but all names SHOULD refer to the same entity.
An example of such an internal name would be the name returned from a
call to the getName method of the GSSCredential interface, when
applied to a credential containing credential elements for multiple
authentication mechanisms employing different namespaces.  This
GSSName object will contain a distinct name for the entity for each
authentication mechanism.
</t>
<t>For GSS-API implementations supporting multiple namespaces, GSSName
implementations MUST contain sufficient information to determine the
namespace to which each primitive name belongs.
</t>
<t hangText="2)">Mechanism-specific contiguous byte array and string forms:
Different GSSName initialization methods are provided to handle both
byte array and string formats and to accommodate various calling
applications and name types.  These formats are capable of containing
only a single name (from a single namespace).  Contiguous string names
are always accompanied by an Object Identifier specifying the
namespace to which the name belongs, and their format is dependent on
the authentication mechanism that employs that name.  The string name
forms are assumed to be printable and may therefore be used by
GSS-API applications for communication with their users.  The byte
array name formats are assumed to be in non-printable formats (e.g.,
the byte array returned from the export method of the GSSName
interface).
</t>
</list></t>
<t>A GSSName object can be converted to a contiguous representation by
using the toString method.  This will guarantee that the name will be
converted to a printable format.  Different initialization methods in
the GSSName interface are defined to allow support for multiple
syntaxes for each supported namespace and to allow users the freedom
to choose a preferred name representation.  The toString method
SHOULD use an implementation-chosen printable syntax for each
supported name type.  To obtain the printable name type,
the getStringNameType method can be used.
</t>
<t>There is no guarantee that calling the toString method on the GSSName
interface will produce the same string form as the original imported
string name.  Furthermore, it is possible that the name was not even
constructed from a string representation.  The same applies to
namespace identifiers, which may not necessarily survive unchanged
after a journey through the internal name form.  An example of this
might be a mechanism that authenticates X.500 names but provides an
algorithmic mapping of Internet DNS names into X.500.  That
mechanism's implementation of GSSName might, when presented with a DNS
name, generate an internal name that contained both the original DNS
name and the equivalent X.500 name.  Alternatively, it might only
store the X.500 name.  In the latter case, the toString method of
GSSName would most likely generate a printable X.500 name, rather than
the original DNS name.
</t>
<t>The context acceptor can obtain a GSSName object representing the
entity performing the context initiation (through the usage of the
getSrcName method).  Since this name has been authenticated by a
single mechanism, it contains only a single name (even if the internal
name presented by the context initiator to the GSSContext object had
multiple components).  Such names are termed internal-mechanism names (or MNs), and the names emitted by the GSSContext interface's getSrcName and getTargName methods are always of this type.  Since some
applications may require MNs without wanting to incur the overhead of
an authentication operation, creation methods are provided that take
not only the name buffer and name type but also the mechanism OID for
which this name should be created.  When dealing with an existing
GSSName object, the canonicalize method may be invoked to convert a
general internal name into an MN.
</t>
<t>GSSName objects can be compared using their equal method, which
returns "true" if the two names being compared refer to the same
entity.  This is the preferred way to perform name comparisons
instead of using the printable names that a given GSS-API
implementation may support.  Since GSS-API assumes that all primitive
names contained within a given internal name refer to the same
entity, equal can return "true" if the two names have at least one
primitive name in common.  If the implementation embodies knowledge
of equivalence relationships between names taken from different
namespaces, this knowledge may also allow successful comparisons of
internal names containing no overlapping primitive elements.
However, applications SHOULD note that to avoid
surprising behavior, it is best to ensure that the names being compared
are either both mechanism names for the same mechanism or both internal
names that are not mechanism names.  This holds whether the equals
method is used directly or the export method is used to generate byte
strings that are then compared byte-by-byte.
</t>
<t>When used in large access control lists, the overhead of creating a
GSSName object on each name and invoking the equal method on each name
from the Access Control List (ACL) may be prohibitive.  As an alternative way of supporting
this case, GSS-API defines a special form of the contiguous byte array
name, which MAY be compared directly (byte by byte).  Contiguous names
suitable for comparison are generated by the export method.  Exported
names MAY be re&nbhy;imported by using the byte array constructor and
specifying the NT_EXPORT_NAME as the name type Object Identifier.  The
resulting GSSName name will also be an MN.
</t>
<t>The GSSName interface defines public static Oid objects representing
the standard name types.  Structurally, an exported name object
consists of a header containing an OID identifying the mechanism that
authenticated the name, and a trailer containing the name itself,
where the syntax of the trailer is defined by the individual
mechanism specification.  Detailed description of the format is
specified in the language-independent GSS-API specification
<xref target="RFC2743"/>.
</t>
<t>Note that the results obtained by using the equals method will in
general be different from those obtained by invoking canonicalize and
export and then comparing the byte array output.  The first series
of operation determines whether two (unauthenticated) names identify
the same principal; the second determines whether a particular mechanism would
authenticate them as the same principal.  These two operations will
in general give the same results only for MNs.
</t>
<t>It is important to note that the above are guidelines as to how GSSName
implementations SHOULD behave and are not intended to be specific
requirements of how name objects must be implemented.  The mechanism
designers are free to decide on the details of their implementations
of the GSSName interface as long as the behavior satisfies the above
guidelines.
</t>
</section> 
<section title="Channel Bindings" anchor="x5.14">
<t>GSS-API supports the use of user-specified tags to identify a given
context to the peer application.  These tags are intended to be used
to identify the particular communications channel that carries the
context.  Channel bindings are communicated to the GSS-API using the
ChannelBinding object.  The application MAY use byte arrays as well as instances of InetAddress to
specify the application data to be used in the channel binding.  The InetAddress for the
initiator and/or acceptor can be used within an instance of a
ChannelBinding.  ChannelBinding can be set for the GSSContext object
using the setChannelBinding method before the first call to init or
accept has been performed.  Unless the setChannelBinding method has
been used to set the ChannelBinding for a GSSContext object, "null"
ChannelBinding will be assumed.  InetAddress is currently the only
address type defined within the Java platform and as such, it is the
only one supported within the ChannelBinding class.  Applications
that use other types of addresses can include them as part of the
application-specific data.
</t>
<t>Conceptually, the GSS-API concatenates the initiator and acceptor
address information and the application-supplied byte array to form
an octet string.  The mechanism calculates a Message Integrity Code
(MIC) over this octet string and binds the MIC to the context
establishment token emitted by the init method of the GSSContext
interface.  The same bindings are set by the context acceptor for its
GSSContext object, and during processing of the accept method, a MIC is
calculated in the same way.  The calculated MIC is compared with that
found in the token, and if the MICs differ, accept will throw a
GSSException with the major code set to BAD_BINDINGS, and the context
will not be established.  Some mechanisms may include the actual
channel-binding data in the token (rather than just a MIC);
applications SHOULD therefore not use confidential data as
channel-binding components.
</t>
<t>Individual mechanisms may impose additional constraints on addresses
that may appear in channel bindings.  For example, a mechanism may
verify that the initiator address field of the channel binding
contains the correct network address of the host system.  Portable
applications SHOULD therefore ensure that they either provide correct
information for the address fields or omit the setting of the addressing
information.

<section title="Detailed GSS-API Class Description" anchor="x7">
<t>This section lists a detailed description of all the public methods
that each of the GSS-API classes and interfaces MUST provide.
</t>
<section title="public abstract class GSSManager" anchor="x7.1">
<t>The GSSManager class is an abstract class that serves as a factory
for three GSS interfaces: GSSName, GSSCredential, and GSSContext.  It
also provides methods for applications to determine what mechanisms
are available from the GSS implementation and what name types these
mechanisms support.  An instance of the default GSSManager subclass
MAY be obtained through the static method getInstance(), but
applications are free to instantiate other subclasses of GSSManager.
</t>
<t>All but one method in this class are declared abstract.  This means
that subclasses have to provide the complete implementation for those
methods.  The only exception to this is the static method
getInstance(), which will have platform-specific code to return an
instance of the default subclass.
</t>

<t>Platform providers of GSS are REQUIRED not to add any constructors to
this class, whether the constructor is private, public, or protected.  This will ensure that all
subclasses invoke only the default constructor provided to the base
class by the compiler.
</t>
<t>A subclass extending the GSSManager abstract class MAY be implemented
as a modular provider-based layer that utilizes some well-known
service provider specification.  The GSSManager API provides the
application with methods to set provider preferences on such an
implementation.  These methods also allow the implementation to throw
a well-defined exception in case provider-based configuration is not
supported.  Applications that expect to be portable SHOULD be aware
of this and recover cleanly by catching the exception.
</t>
<t>It is envisioned that there will be three most common ways in which
providers will be used:
</t>
<t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="3"><t hangText="1)">The application does not care about what provider is used (the
default case).
</t>
<t hangText="2)">The application wants a particular provider to be used
preferentially, either for a particular mechanism or all the time,
irrespective of the mechanism.
</t>
<t hangText="3)">The application wants to use the locally configured providers as
far as possible, but if support is missing for one or more mechanisms,
then it wants to fall back on its own provider.
</t>
</list></t>
<t>The GSSManager class has two methods that enable these modes of
usage: addProviderAtFront() and addProviderAtEnd().  These methods
have the effect of creating an ordered list of &lt;provider, OID&gt; pairs
where each pair indicates a preference of provider for a given OID.
</t>
<t>The use of these methods does not require any knowledge of whatever
service provider specification the GSSManager subclass follows.  It
is hoped that these methods will serve the needs of most
applications.  Additional methods MAY be added to an extended
GSSManager that could be part of a service provider specification
that is standardized later.
</t>
<t>When neither of the methods is called, the implementation SHOULD choose
a default provider for each mechanism it supports.

when they do not support m1 should a provider A be checked.  It would
then make the call:

then call:
</t>
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[

mgr.addProviderAtEnd(B, null);

<t>Effectively, the list of preferences now becomes {..., (A, m1), (B,

</t>
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[

<t>then the previous setting with the pair (B, null) subsumes this;
therefore, this request SHOULD be ignored.  The same would happen if a
request is made for the already existing pairs of (A, m1) or (B,
null).

<t>Please note, however, that the following call:
</t>
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[

<section title="public interface GSSCredential implements Cloneable" anchor="x7.3">
<t>This interface encapsulates the GSS-API credentials for an entity.  A
credential contains all the necessary cryptographic information to
enable the creation of a context on behalf of the entity that it
represents.  It MAY contain multiple, distinct, mechanism-specific
credential elements, each containing information for a specific
security mechanism, but all referring to the same entity.
</t>
<t>A credential MAY be used to perform context initiation, acceptance,
or both.
</t>
<t>GSS-API implementations MUST impose a local access-control policy on
callers to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring credentials to
which they are not entitled.  GSS-API credential creation is not
intended to provide a "login to the network" function, as such a
function would involve the creation of new credentials rather than
merely acquiring a handle to existing credentials.  Such functions,
if required, SHOULD be defined in implementation-specific extensions
to the API.
</t>
<t>If credential acquisition is time-consuming for a mechanism, the
mechanism MAY choose to delay the actual acquisition until the
credential is required (e.g., by GSSContext).  Such mechanism-specific implementation decisions SHOULD be invisible to the calling
application; thus, the query methods immediately following the
creation of a credential object MUST return valid credential data
and may therefore incur the overhead of a deferred credential
acquisition.
</t>
<t>Applications will create a credential object passing the desired
parameters.  The application can then use the query methods to obtain
specific information about the instantiated credential object
(equivalent to the gss_inquire routines).  When the credential is no
longer needed, the application SHOULD call the dispose (equivalent to
gss_release_cred) method to release any resources held by the
credential object and to destroy any cryptographically sensitive
information.
</t>
<t>Classes implementing this interface also implement the Cloneable
interface.  This indicates that the class will support the clone()
method that will allow the creation of duplicate credentials.  This
is useful when called just before the add() call to retain a copy of
the original credential.

<section title="public interface GSSContext" anchor="x7.4"> 
<t>This interface encapsulates the GSS-API security context and provides
the security services (wrap, unwrap, getMIC, and verifyMIC) that are
available over the context.  Security contexts are established
between peers using locally acquired credentials.  Multiple contexts
may exist simultaneously between a pair of peers, using the same or
different set of credentials.  GSS-API functions in a manner
independent of the underlying transport protocol and depends on its
calling application to transport its tokens between peers.
</t>
<t>Before the context establishment phase is initiated, the context
initiator may request specific characteristics desired of the
established context.  These can be set using the set methods.  After
the context is established, the caller can check the actual
characteristic and services offered by the context using the query
methods.
</t>
<t>The context establishment phase begins with the first call to the
init method by the context initiator.  During this phase, the
initSecContext and acceptSecContext methods will produce GSS-API
authentication tokens, which the calling application needs to send to
its peer.  If an error occurs at any point, an exception will get
thrown and the code will start executing in a catch block where the
exception may contain an output token that should be sent to the
peer for debugging or informational purpose.  If not,
the normal flow of code continues, and the application can make a call
to the isEstablished() method.  If this method returns "false", it
indicates that a token is needed from its peer in order to continue
the context establishment phase.  A return value of "true" signals that
the local end of the context is established.  This may still require
that a token be sent to the peer, if one is produced by GSS-API.
During the context establishment phase, the isProtReady() method may
be called to determine if the context can be used for the per-message
operations.  This allows applications to use per-message operations
on contexts that aren't fully established.
</t>
<t>After the context has been established or the isProtReady() method
returns "true", the query routines can be invoked to determine the
actual characteristics and services of the established context.  The
application can also start using the per-message methods of wrap and
getMIC to obtain cryptographic operations on application-supplied
data.

dispose to release any system resources the context may be using.

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
public byte[] export() throws GSSException

<t>Provided to support the sharing of work between multiple processes.
This routine will typically be used by the context acceptor, in an
application where a single process receives incoming connection
requests and accepts security contexts over them, then passes the
established context to one or more other processes for message
exchange.
</t>
<t>This method deactivates the security context and creates an
inter-process token that, when passed to the byte array constructor
of the GSSContext interface in another process, will re-activate the
context in the second process.  Only a single instantiation of a
given context may be active at any one time; a subsequent attempt by
a context exporter to access the exported security context will fail.
</t>
<t>The implementation MAY constrain the set of processes by which the
inter-process token may be imported, either as a function of local
security policy or as a result of implementation decisions.  For
example, some implementations may constrain contexts to be passed
only between processes that run under the same account, or which are
part of the same process group.
</t>
<t>The inter-process token MAY contain security-sensitive information
(for example, cryptographic keys).  While mechanisms are encouraged
either to avoid placing such sensitive information within inter-process
tokens or to encrypt the token before returning it to the
application, in a typical GSS-API implementation, this may not be
possible.  Thus, the application MUST take care to protect the
inter-process token and ensure that any process to which the token is
transferred is trustworthy.

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="x9">
<t>The Java language security model allows platform providers to have
policy-based fine-grained access control over any resource that an
application wants.  When using a Java security manager (such as, but
not limited to, the case of applets running in browsers), the
application code is in a sandbox by default.
</t>
<t>Administrators of the platform JRE determine what permissions, if any,
are to be given to source from different codebases.  Thus, the
administrator has to be aware of any special requirements that the GSS
provider might have for system resources.  For instance, a Kerberos
provider might wish to make a network connection to the Key
Distribution Center (KDC) to obtain initial credentials.  This would
not be allowed under the sandbox unless the administrator had granted
permissions for this.  Also, note that this granting and checking of
permissions happens transparently to the application and is outside
the scope of this document.
</t>
<t>The Java language allows administrators to pre-configure a list of
security service providers in the &lt;JRE&gt;/lib/security/java.security
file.  At runtime, the system approaches these providers in order of
preference when looking for security-related services.  Applications
have a means to modify this list through methods in the "Security"
class in the "java.security" package.  However, since these
modifications would be visible in the entire Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and thus affect all
code executing in it, this operation is not available in the sandbox
and requires special permissions to perform.  Thus, when a GSS
application has special needs that are met by a particular security
provider, it has two choices:
</t>
<t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="3"><t hangText="1)">Install the provider on a JVM-wide basis using the
java.security.Security class and then depend on the system to find
the right provider automatically when the need arises.  (This would
require the application to be granted a "insertProvider
SecurityPermission".)
</t>
<t hangText="2)">Pass an instance of the provider to the local instance of
GSSManager so that only factory calls going through that GSSManager
use the desired provider.  (This would not require any permissions.)

<section title="Changes since RFC 5653" anchor="x12"> 
<t>This document has following changes:
</t>
<t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="3"><t hangText="1)">New error token embedded in GSSException
</t>
<t>There is a design flaw in the initSecContext and acceptSecContext
methods of the GSSContext class defined in "Generic Security Service
API Version 2: Java Bindings Update" <xref target="RFC5653"/>.
</t>
<t>The methods could either return a token (possibly null if no more
tokens are needed) when the call succeeds or throw a GSSException
if there is a failure, but NOT both.  On the other hand, the C-bindings
of GSS-API <xref target="RFC2744"/> can return both; that is to say,
a call to the GSS_Init_sec_context() function can return a
major status code, and at the same time, fill in the output_token
argument if there is one.
</t>
<t>Without the ability to emit an error token when there is a failure,
a Java application has no mechanism to tell the other side what the error is.
For example, a "reject" NegTokenResp token can never be transmitted
for the SPNEGO mechanism <xref target="RFC4178"/>.
</t>
<t>While a Java method can never return a value and throw an exception at
the same time, we can embed the error token inside the exception so that the
caller has a chance to retrieve it.  This update adds a new GSSException
constructor to include this token inside a GSSException object and a
getOutputToken() method to retrieve the token.  The specification for
the initSecContext and acceptSecContext methods are updated to describe
the new behavior.  Various examples are also updated.
</t>
<t>New JGSS programs SHOULD make use of this new feature, but it is not mandatory.
A program that intends to run with both old and new GSS Java bindings
can use reflection to check the availability of this new method and call
it accordingly.
</t>
<t hangText="2)">Removing Stream-Based GSSContext Methods
</t>
<t>The overloaded methods of GSSContext that use input and output streams
as the means to convey authentication and per-message GSS&nbhy;API tokens
as described in Section 5.15 of RFC 5653 <xref target="RFC5653"/> are removed in this
update as the wire protocol should be defined by an application and not
a library. It's also impossible to implement these methods correctly
when the token has no self-framing (where the end cannot be determined),
or the library has no knowledge of the token format (for example,
as a bridge talking to another GSS library).  These methods include
initSecContext (Section 7.4.5 of RFC 5653 <xref target="RFC5653"/>),
acceptSecContext (Section 7.4.9 of RFC 5653 <xref target="RFC5653"/>),
wrap (Section 7.4.15 of RFC 5653 <xref target="RFC5653"/>),
unwrap (Section 7.4.17 of RFC 5653 <xref target="RFC5653"/>),
getMIC (Section 7.4.19 of RFC 5653 <xref target="RFC5653"/>),
and verifyMIC (Section 7.4.21 of RFC 5653 <xref target="RFC5653"/>).
</t>
</list></t>
</section>
<section title="Changes since RFC 2853" anchor="x13"> 
<t>This document has the following changes:
</t>
<t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="3"><t hangText="1)">Major GSS Status Code Constant Values
</t>
<t>RFC 2853 listed all the GSS status code values in two different
sections: Section 4.12.1 defined numeric values for them, and Section
6.8.1 defined them as static constants in the GSSException class
without assigning any values.  Due to an inconsistent ordering
between these two sections, all of the GSS major status codes
resulted in misalignment and a subsequent disagreement between
deployed implementations.
</t>
<t>This document defines the numeric values of the GSS status codes in
both sections, while maintaining the original ordering from Section
6.8.1 of RFC 2853 <xref target="RFC2853"/>, and it obsoletes the GSS status code values
defined in Section 4.12.1.  The relevant sections in this document are
Sections <xref target="x5.12.1" format="counter"/> and <xref target="x7.8.1" format="counter"/>.
</t>
<t hangText="2)">GSS Credential Usage Constant Values
</t>
<t>RFC 2853, Section 6.3.2 defines static constants for the GSSCredential
usage flags.  However, the values of these constants were not defined
anywhere in RFC 2853 <xref target="RFC2853"/>.
</t>
<t>This document defines the credential usage values in Section <xref target="x7.3.1" format="counter"/>.
The original ordering of these values from Section 6.3.2 of RFC 2853
<xref target="RFC2853"/> is maintained.
</t>
<t hangText="3)">GSS Host-Based Service Name
</t>
<t>RFC 2853 <xref target="RFC2853"/>, Section 6.2.2 defines the static constant for the
GSS host-based service OID NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE, using a deprecated
OID value.
</t>
<t>This document updates the NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE OID value in Section
<xref target="x7.2.1" format="counter"/> to be consistent with the C-bindings in RFC 2744
<xref target="RFC2744"/>.
