    <abstract>
      <t>Enterprise network administrators worldwide are in various stages of
      preparing for or deploying IPv6 into their networks. The administrators
      face different challenges than operators of Internet access providers
      and have reasons for different priorities. The overall problem for many
      administrators will be to offer Internet-facing services over IPv6
      while continuing to support IPv4, and while introducing IPv6 access
      within the enterprise IT network. The overall transition will take most
      networks from an IPv4-only environment to a dual-stack network
      environment and eventually an IPv6-only operating mode. This document
      helps provide a framework for enterprise network architects or
      administrators who may be faced with many of these challenges as they
      consider their IPv6 support strategies.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>An enterprise network is defined in <xref target="RFC4057"/> as a
      network that has multiple internal links, one or more router connections
      to one or more providers, and is actively managed by a network
      operations entity (the "administrator", whether a single person or
      a department of administrators). Administrators generally support an
      internal network, consisting of users' workstations; personal computers;
      mobile devices; other computing devices and related peripherals; a server 
      network, consisting of accounting and business application servers; and an
      external network, consisting of Internet-accessible services such as web
      servers, email servers, VPN systems, and customer applications. This
      document is intended as guidance for enterprise network architects and
      administrators in planning their IPv6 deployments.</t>

      <t>The business reasons for spending time, effort, and money on
      IPv6 will be unique to each enterprise. The most common drivers
      are due to the fact that when Internet service providers,
      including mobile wireless carriers, run out of IPv4 addresses,
      they will provide native IPv6 and 

<!--[rfced] Since NAT64 and NAT444 are not marked as common on the Abbreviations 
      list, they should include an expansion on the first mention.  Please let us know if 
      you agree with the suggested text below; if not, please let us know 
      how to update the text.

      Original:
      The non-native IPv4 service may be NAT64, NAT444, Dual-stack Lite, 
      MAP-T, MAP-E, or other transition technologies.

      Suggested:
      The non-native IPv4 service may be
      Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 
      Servers (NAT64), Carrier-Grade NAT (NAT444), Dual-Stack Lite (DS Lite), 
      Mapping of Address and Port using Translation (MAP-T), Mapping of Address
      and Port using Encapsulation (MAP-E), or other transition technologies.

-->
      non-native IPv4. The non-native IPv4 service may be NAT64, NAT444,
      Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite), Mapping of Address and Port using Translation (MAP-T), 
      Mapping of Address and Port using Encapsulation (MAP-E), or other transition technologies. Compared
      to tunneled or translated service, native traffic typically performs 
      better and more reliably than non-native. For example, for client networks      
      trying to reach enterprise networks, the IPv6 experience will be better 
      than the transitional IPv4 if the enterprise deploys IPv6 in its public-facing
      services. The native IPv6 network path should also be simpler to 
      manage and, if necessary, troubleshoot. Further, enterprises doing 
      business in growing parts of the world may find IPv6 growing faster there,      
      where again potential new customers, employees, and partners are using 
      IPv6. It is thus in the enterprise's interest to deploy native IPv6 at 
      the very least in its public-facing services but ultimately across the 
      majority or all of its scope.</t>

      <t/>

      <t>The text in this document provides specific guidance for enterprise
      networks and complements other related work in the IETF, including
      <xref target="IPv6-DESIGN"/> and <xref
      target="RFC5375"/>.</t>

      <section anchor="Enterprise_Assumptions" title="Enterprise Assumptions">
        <t>For the purpose of this document, we assume the following:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The administrator is considering deploying IPv6 (but see <xref
            target="IPv4-Only"/> below).</t>

            <t>The administrator has existing IPv4 networks and devices that
            will continue to operate and be supported.</t>

            <t>The administrator will want to minimize the level of disruption
            to the users and services by minimizing the number of technologies and
            functions that are needed to mediate any given application. In
            other words, provide native IP wherever possible.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Based on these assumptions, an administrator will want to use
        technologies that minimize the number of flows being tunneled,
        translated, or intercepted at any given time. The administrator will
        choose transition technologies or strategies that both allow most traffic
        to be native and manage non-native traffic. This will allow the
        administrator to minimize the cost of IPv6 transition technologies by
        containing the number and scale of transition systems.</t>

        <t>Tunnels used for IPv6/IPv4 transition are expected as near-/mid-term
        mechanisms, while IPv6 tunneling will be used for many long-term
        operational purposes such as security, routing control, mobility,
        multihoming, traffic engineering, etc. We refer to the former class
        of tunnels as "transition tunnels".</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="IPv4-Only" title="IPv4-Only Considerations">
        <t>As described in <xref target="RFC6302"/>, administrators should take
        certain steps even if they are not considering IPv6. Specifically,
        Internet-facing servers should log the source port number, timestamp
        (from a reliable source), and the transport protocol. This will allow
        investigation of malefactors behind address-sharing technologies such
        as NAT444, MAP, or DS Lite. Such logs should be protected for 
	integrity, safeguarded for privacy, and periodically purged within 
	applicable regulations for log retention.</t>

        <t>Other IPv6 considerations may impact ostensibly IPv4-only networks,
        e.g., <xref target="RFC6104"/> describes the rogue IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) problem,
        which may cause problems in IPv4-only networks where IPv6 is enabled
        in end systems on that network. Further discussion of the security
        implications of IPv6 in IPv4-only networks can be found in <xref
        target="RFC7123"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Reasons for a Phased Approach">
        <t>Given the challenges of transitioning user workstations, corporate
        systems, and Internet-facing servers, a phased approach allows
        incremental deployment of IPv6, based on the administrator's own
        determination of priorities. This document outlines suggested
        phases: a Preparation and Assessment Phase, an Internal Phase, 
	and an External Phase. The Preparation Phase is highly recommended to 
	all administrators, as it will save errors and complexity in later 
	phases.  Each administrator must decide whether to begin with an 
	External Phase (enabling IPv6 for Internet-facing systems, as 
	recommended in <xref target="RFC5211"/>) or an Internal Phase 
	(enabling IPv6 for internal interconnections first).</t>

        <t>Each scenario is likely to be different to some extent, but we can
        highlight some considerations:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>In many cases, customers outside the network will have IPv6
            before the internal enterprise network. For these customers, IPv6
            may well perform better, especially for certain applications, than
            translated or tunneled IPv4, so the administrator may want to
            prioritize the External Phase such that those customers have the
            simplest and most robust connectivity to the enterprise, or at
            least its external-facing elements.</t>

            <t>Employees who access internal systems by VPN may find that
            their ISPs provide translated IPv4, which does not support the
            required VPN protocols. In these cases, the administrator may want
            to prioritize the External Phase and any other
            remotely accessible internal systems. It is worth noting that a
            number of emerging VPN solutions provide dual-stack connectivity;
            thus, a VPN service may be useful for employees in IPv4-only access
            networks to access IPv6 resources in the enterprise network (much
            like many public tunnel broker services, but specifically for the
            enterprise). Some security considerations are described in  <xref 
	    target="RFC7359"/>. </t>

            <t>Internet-facing servers cannot be managed over IPv6 unless the
            management systems are IPv6 capable. These might be Network
            Management Systems (NMS), monitoring systems, or just remote
            management desktops. Thus, in some cases, the Internet-facing
            systems are dependent on IPv6-capable internal networks. However,
            dual-stack Internet-facing systems can still be managed over
            IPv4.</t>

            <t>Virtual Machines (VMs) may enable a faster rollout once initial
            system deployment is complete. Management of VMs over IPv6 is
            still dependent on the management software supporting IPv6.</t>

            <t>IPv6 is enabled by default on all modern operating systems, so
            it may be more urgent to manage and have visibility on the
            internal traffic. It is important to manage IPv6 for security
            purposes, even in an ostensibly IPv4-only network, as described in
            <xref target="RFC7123"/>.</t>

            <t>In many cases, the corporate accounting, payroll, human
            resource, and other internal systems may only need to be reachable
            from the internal network, so they may be a lower priority. As
            enterprises require their vendors to support IPv6, more internal
            applications will support IPv6 by default, and it can be expected
            that eventually new applications will only support IPv6. The
            inventory, as described in <xref target="inventory_phase"/>, will
            help determine the systems' readiness, as well as the readiness of
            the supporting network elements and security, which will be a
            consideration in prioritization of these corporate systems.</t>

            <t>Some large organizations (even when using private IPv4
            addresses <xref target="RFC1918"/>) are facing IPv4 address
            exhaustion because of the internal network growth (for example, the
            vast number of VMs) or because of the acquisition of
            other companies that often raise private IPv4 address overlapping
            issues.</t>

            <t>IPv6 restores end-to-end transparency even for internal
            applications (of course security policies must still be enforced).
            When two organizations or networks merge <xref
            target="RFC6879"/>, the unique addressing of
            IPv6 can make the merger much easier and faster. A merger may,
            therefore, prioritize IPv6 for the affected systems.</t>
          </list> These considerations are in conflict; each administrator
        must prioritize according to their company's conditions. It is worth
        noting that the reasons given in "A Large Corporate User's View of
        IPng", described in <xref target="RFC1687"/>, for reluctance to deploy
        have largely been satisfied or overcome in the intervening years.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Preparation and Assessment Phase" toc="default">
      <t/>

      <section title="Program Planning">
      
       <t>Since enabling IPv6 is a change to the most fundamental Internet 
       Protocol, and since there are so many interdependencies, having a 
       professional project manager organize the work is highly recommended. 
       In addition, an executive sponsor should be involved in determining 
       the goals of enabling IPv6 (which will establish the order of the 
       phases) and should receive regular updates.</t>

       <t>It may be necessary to complete the Preparation Phase before 
       determining whether to prioritize the Internal or External Phase, since 
       needs and readiness assessments are part of that phase. For a large 
       enterprise, it may take several iterations to really understand the  
       level of effort required.  Depending on the required schedule, it may 
       be useful to roll IPv6 projects into other architectural upgrades -- this 
       can be an excellent way to improve the network and reduce costs.  
       However, by increasing the scope of projects, the schedule is often 
       affected. For instance, a major systems upgrade may take a year to 
       complete, where just patching existing systems may take only a few 
       months.  </t>

       <t>The deployment of IPv6 will not generally stop all other technology
       work.  Once IPv6 has been identified as an important initiative, all    
       projects, both new and in progress, will need to be reviewed to ensure 
       IPv6 support.</t>

       <t>It is normal for assessments to continue in some areas while
       execution of the project begins in other areas.  This is fine, as long 
       as recommendations in other parts of this document are considered, 
       especially regarding security (for instance, one should not deploy 
       IPv6 on a system before security has been evaluated).  </t>

        </section>

      <section anchor="inventory_phase" title="Inventory Phase">
        <t>To comprehend the scope of the Inventory Phase, we recommend
        dividing the problem space in two: network infrastructure readiness
        and applications readiness.</t>

        <section title="Network Infrastructure Readiness Assessment">
        <t>The goal of this assessment is to identify the level of IPv6
        readiness of network equipment. This will identify the effort required 
        to move to an infrastructure that supports IPv6 with the same 
        functional service capabilities as the existing IPv4 network. This may 
        also require a feature comparison and gap analysis between IPv4 and 
        IPv6 functionality on the network equipment and software. IPv6 support
	will require testing; features often work differently in vendors' labs
	than production networks. Some devices and software will require IPv4
	support for IPv6 to work.</t>

          <t>The inventory will show which network devices are already
          capable, which devices can be made IPv6 ready with a
          code/firmware upgrade, and which devices will need to be
          replaced. The data collection consists of a network discovery to
          gain an understanding of the topology and inventory network
          infrastructure equipment and code versions with information
          gathered from static files and IP address management, DNS, and
          DHCP tools.</t>

          <t>Since IPv6 might already be present in the environment,
          through default configurations or VPNs, an infrastructure
          assessment (at minimum) is essential to evaluate potential
          security risks.</t> </section>

        <section title="Application Readiness Assessment">
          <t>Just like network equipment, application software needs to
          support IPv6. This includes OS, firmware, middleware, and
          applications (including internally developed applications). Vendors
          will typically handle IPv6 enablement of off-the-shelf products, but
          often enterprises need to request this support from vendors. For
          internally developed applications, it is the responsibility of the
          enterprise to enable them for IPv6. Analyzing how a given
          application communicates over the network will dictate the steps
          required to support IPv6. Applications should avoid instructions
          specific to a given IP address family. Any applications that use 
          APIs, such as the C language, that expose the IP version 
          specifically, need to be modified to also work with IPv6.</t>

          <t>There are two ways to IPv6-enable applications. The first
          approach is to have separate logic for IPv4 and IPv6, thus leaving
          the IPv4 code path mainly untouched. This approach causes the least
          disruption to the existing IPv4 logic flow, but introduces more
          complexity, since the application now has to deal with two logic
          loops with complex race conditions and error recovery mechanisms
          between these two logic loops. The second approach is to create a
          combined IPv4/IPv6 logic, which ensures operation regardless of the
          IP version used on the network. Knowing whether a given
          implementation will use IPv4 or IPv6 in a given deployment is a
          matter of some art; see Source Address Selection <xref
          target="RFC6724"/> and Happy Eyeballs <xref target="RFC6555"/>. It
          is generally recommended that the application developer use industry
          IPv6-porting tools to locate the code that needs to be updated. Some
          discussion of IPv6 application porting issues can be found in <xref
          target="RFC4038"/>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Importance of Readiness Validation and Testing">
          <t>Lastly, IPv6 introduces a completely new way of addressing
          endpoints, which can have ramifications at the network layer all the
          way up to the applications. So to minimize disruption during the
          transition phase, we recommend complete functionality, scalability,
          and security testing to understand how IPv6 impacts the services and
          networking infrastructure.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Training">
        <t>Many organizations falter in IPv6 deployment because of a 
	perceived training gap. Training is important for those who work with
	addresses regularly, as with anyone whose work is changing. Better
        knowledge of the reasons IPv6 is being deployed will help inform the
	assessment of who needs training and what training they need.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Security Policy">
        <t>It is obvious that IPv6 networks should be deployed in a secure
        way. The industry has learned a lot about network security with IPv4,
        so network operators should leverage this knowledge and expertise
        when deploying IPv6. IPv6 is not so different than IPv4: it is a
        connectionless network protocol using the same lower-layer service and
        delivering the same service to the upper layer. Therefore, the
        security issues and mitigation techniques are mostly identical with
        the same exceptions that are described further.</t>

        <section title="IPv6 Is No More Secure Than IPv4">
          <t>Some people believe that IPv6 is inherently more secure than IPv4
          because it is new. Nothing can be more wrong. Indeed, being a new
          protocol means that bugs in the implementations have yet to be
          discovered and fixed and that few people have the operational
          security expertise needed to operate securely an IPv6 network. This
          lack of operational expertise is the biggest threat when deploying
          IPv6: the importance of training is to be stressed again.</t>

          <t>One security myth is that, thanks to its huge address space, a
          network cannot be scanned by enumerating all IPv6 addresses in a /64
          LAN; hence, a malevolent person cannot find a victim. <xref
          target="RFC5157"/> describes some alternate techniques to find
          potential targets on a network, for example, enumerating all DNS
          names in a zone. Additional advice in this area is also given in
          <xref target="HOST-SCANNING"/>.</t>

          <t>Another security myth is that IPv6 is more secure because it
          mandates the use of IPsec everywhere. While the original IPv6
          specifications may have implied this, <xref target="RFC6434"/>
          clearly states that IPsec support is not mandatory. Moreover, if all
          the intra-enterprise traffic is encrypted, both malefactors and 
	  security tools that rely on payload inspection (Intrusion Prevention 
          System (IPS), firewall, Access Control List (ACL), 
	  IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) (<xref target="RFC7011"/> and <xref target="RFC7012"/>), etc.) 
	  will be affected.  Therefore, IPsec is as useful in IPv6
          as in IPv4 (for example, to establish a VPN overlay over a 
	  non-trusted network or to reserve for some specific applications).</t>

          <t>The last security myth is that amplification attacks (such as
          <xref target="SMURF"/>) do not exist in IPv6 because there is no
          more broadcast. Alas, this is not true as ICMP error (in some cases)
          or information messages can be generated by routers and hosts when
          forwarding or receiving a multicast message (see Section 2.4 of
          <xref target="RFC4443"/>). Therefore, the generation and the
          forwarding rate of ICMPv6 messages must be limited as in IPv4.</t>

          <t>It should be noted that in a dual-stack network, the security
          implementation for both IPv4 and IPv6 needs to be considered, in
          addition to security considerations related to the interaction of
          (and transition between) the two, while they coexist.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Similarities between IPv6 and IPv4 Security">
          <t>As mentioned earlier, IPv6 is quite similar to IPv4; therefore,
          several attacks apply for both protocol families, including:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>Application layer attacks: such as cross-site scripting or
              SQL injection</t>

              <t>Rogue device: such as a rogue Wi-Fi access point</t>

              <t>Flooding and all traffic-based denial of services (including
              the use of control plane policing for IPv6 traffic: see <xref
              target="RFC6192"/>)</t>

            </list></t>

          <t>A specific case of congruence is IPv6 Unique Local Addresses
          (ULAs) <xref target="RFC4193"/> and IPv4 private addressing <xref
          target="RFC1918"/>, which do not provide any security by 'magic'. In
          both cases, the edge router must apply strict filters to block those
          private addresses from entering and, just as importantly, leaving
          the network. This filtering can be done by the enterprise or by the
          ISP, but the cautious administrator will prefer to do it in the
          enterprise.</t>

          <t>IPv6 addresses can be spoofed as easily as IPv4 addresses, and
          there are packets with bogon IPv6 addresses (see <xref
          target="CYMRU"/>). Anti-bogon filtering must be done in the data and
          routing planes. It can be done by the enterprise or by the ISP, or
          both, but again the cautious administrator will prefer to do it in
          the enterprise.</t>

        <section anchor="ipv6_security_specifics"
                 title="Specific Security Issues for IPv6">
          <t>Even if IPv6 is similar to IPv4, there are some differences that
          create some IPv6-only vulnerabilities or issues. We give examples of
          such differences in this section.</t>

          <t>Privacy extension addresses <xref target="RFC4941"/> are usually
          used to protect individual privacy by periodically changing the
          interface identifier part of the IPv6 address to avoid tracking a
          host by its otherwise always identical and unique 64-bit Extended Unique 
          Identifier (EUI&nbhy;64) based on Media Access Control (MAC).
          While this presents a real advantage on the Internet, moderated by
          the fact that the prefix part remains the same, it complicates the
          task of following an audit trail when a security officer or network
          operator wants to trace back a log entry to a host in their network
          because when the tracing is done, the searched IPv6 address could
          have disappeared from the network. Therefore, the use of privacy
          extension addresses usually requires additional monitoring and
          logging of the binding of the IPv6 address to a data-link layer
          address (see also the monitoring section in <xref
          target="IPv6-SECURITY"/>, Section 2.5). Some early enterprise deployments
          have taken the approach of using tools that harvest IP/MAC address
          mappings from switch and router devices to provide address
          accountability; this approach has been shown to work, though it can
          involve gathering significantly more address data than in equivalent
          IPv4 networks. An alternative is to try to prevent the use of
          privacy extension addresses by enforcing the use of DHCPv6, such
          that hosts only get addresses assigned by a DHCPv6 server. This can
          be done by configuring routers to set the M bit in RAs,
          combined with all advertised prefixes being included
          without the A bit set (to prevent the use of stateless
          autoconfiguration). Of course, this technique requires that all
          hosts support stateful DHCPv6. It is important to note that not all
          operating systems exhibit the same behavior when processing RAs with
          the M bit set. The varying OS behavior is related to the lack of
          prescriptive definition around the A, M, and O bits within the Neighbor 
          Discovery Protocol (NDP).  <xref target="DHCPv6-SLAAC-PROBLEM"/>
          provides a much more detailed analysis on the interaction of the
          M bit and DHCPv6.</t>

          <t>Extension headers complicate the task of stateless packet filters
          such as ACLs. If ACLs are used to enforce a security policy, then
          the enterprise must verify whether its ACLs (but also stateful
          firewalls) are able to process extension headers (this means
          understand them enough to parse them to find the upper-layer
          payloads) and to block unwanted extension headers (e.g., to
          implement <xref target="RFC5095"/>). This topic is discussed further
          in <xref target="RFC7045"/>.</t>

          <t>Fragmentation is different in IPv6 because it is done only by the
          source host and never during a forwarding operation. This means that
          ICMPv6 packet-too-big messages must be allowed to pass through the
          network and not be filtered <xref target="RFC4890"/>. Fragments can
          also be used to evade some security mechanisms such as RA-Guard
          <xref target="RFC6105"/>. See also <xref target="RFC5722"/> and
          <xref target="RFC7113"/>.</t>

          <t>One of the biggest differences between IPv4 and IPv6 is the
          introduction of NDP <xref
          target="RFC4861"/>, which includes a variety of important IPv6
          protocol functions, including those provided in IPv4 by the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) <xref
          target="RFC0826"/>. NDP runs over ICMPv6 (which as stated above
          means that security policies must allow some ICMPv6 messages to
          pass, as described in RFC 4890), but has the same lack of security
          as, for example, ARP, in that there is no inherent message
          authentication. While Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) <xref
          target="RFC3971"/> and Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs) <xref target="RFC3972"/> have been
          defined, they are not widely implemented). The threat model for
          RAs within the NDP suite is similar to that of
          DHCPv4 (and DHCPv6), in that a rogue host could be either a rogue
          router or a rogue DHCP server. An IPv4 network can be made more
          secure with the help of DHCPv4 snooping in edge switches, and
          likewise RA snooping can improve IPv6 network security (in IPv4-only
          networks as well). Thus, enterprises using such techniques for IPv4
          should use the equivalent techniques for IPv6, including RA-Guard
          <xref target="RFC6105"/> and all work in progress from the Source 
          Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) WG, 
          e.g., <xref target="RFC6959"/>, which is similar to the
          protection given by dynamic ARP monitoring in IPv4. Other DoS
          vulnerabilities are related to NDP cache exhaustion, and mitigation
          techniques can be found in (<xref target="RFC6583"/>).</t>

          <t>As stated previously, running a dual-stack network doubles the
          attack exposure as a malevolent person has now two attack vectors:
          IPv4 and IPv6. This simply means that all routers and hosts
          operating in a dual-stack environment with both protocol families
          enabled (even if by default) must have a congruent security policy
          for both protocol versions. For example, permit TCP ports 80 and 443
          to all web servers and deny all other ports to the same servers must
          be implemented both for IPv4 and IPv6. It is thus important that the
          tools available to administrators readily support such
          behavior.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Routing">
        <t>An important design choice to be made is what IGP is to use inside the
        network. A variety of IGPs (IS-IS, OSPFv3, and Routing Information 
        Protocol Next Generation (RIPng)) support IPv6
        today, and picking one over the other is a design choice that will be
        dictated mostly by existing operational policies in an enterprise
        network. As mentioned earlier, it would be beneficial to maintain
        operational parity between IPv4 and IPv6; therefore, it might make
        sense to continue using the same protocol family that is being used
        for IPv4. For example, in a network using OSPFv2 for IPv4, it might
        make sense to use OSPFv3 for IPv6. It is important to note that
        although OSPFv3 is similar to OSPFv2, they are not the same. On the
        other hand, some organizations may chose to run different routing
        protocols for different IP versions. For example, one may chose to run
        OSPFv2 for IPv4 and IS-IS for IPv6. An important design question to
        consider here is whether to support one IGP or two different IGPs in
        the longer term. <xref target="IPv6-DESIGN"/>
        presents advice on the design choices that arise when considering IGPs
        and discusses the advantages and disadvantages to different approaches
        in detail.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="Address_Plan" title="Address Plan">
        <t>The most common problem encountered in IPv6 networking is in
        applying the same principles of conservation that are so important in
        IPv4. IPv6 addresses do not need to be assigned conservatively. In
        fact, a single, larger allocation is considered more conservative than
        multiple non-contiguous small blocks because a single block occupies
        only a single entry in a routing table. The advice in <xref
        target="RFC5375"/> is still sound and is recommended to the reader.
        If considering ULAs, give careful thought to how well it is supported,
        especially in multiple address and multicast scenarios, and assess the
        strength of the requirement for ULA. <xref
        target="ULA-USAGE"/> provides much more
        detailed analysis and recommendations on the usage of ULAs.</t>

        <t>The enterprise administrator will want to evaluate whether the
        enterprise will request address space from a Local Internet
        Registry (LIR) such as an ISP; a Regional Internet Registry (RIR) such as
        AfriNIC, APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, or RIPE-NCC; or a National Internet
        Registry (NIR) operated in some countries. The normal allocation is
        Provider-Aggregated (PA) address space from the enterprise's ISP,
        but use of PA space implies renumbering when changing providers.
        Instead, an enterprise may request Provider-Independent (PI) space;
        this may involve an additional fee, but the enterprise may then be
        better able to be multihomed using that prefix and will avoid a
        renumbering process when changing ISPs (though it should be noted that
        renumbering caused by outgrowing the space, merger, or other internal
        reason would still not be avoided with PI space).</t>

        <t>The type of address selected (PI vs. PA) should be congruent with
        the routing needs of the enterprise. The selection of address type
        will determine if an operator will need to apply new routing
        techniques and may limit future flexibility. There is no right answer,
        but the needs of the External Phase may affect what address type is
        selected.</t>

        <t>Each network location or site will need a prefix assignment.
        Depending on the type of site/location, various prefix sizes may be
        used. In general, historical guidance suggests that each site should
        get at least a /48, as documented in RFC 5375 and <xref
        target="RFC6177"/>. In addition to allowing for simple planning, this
        can allow a site to use its prefix for local connectivity, should the
        need arise, and if the local ISP supports it.</t>

        <t>When assigning addresses to end systems, the enterprise may use
        manually configured addresses (common on servers) or Stateless Address 
        Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) or DHCPv6
        for client systems. Early IPv6 enterprise deployments have used SLAAC
        both for its simplicity and the time DHCPv6 has taken to
        mature. However, DHCPv6 is now very mature; thus, workstations
        managed by an enterprise may use stateful DHCPv6 for addressing on
        corporate LAN segments. DHCPv6 allows for the additional configuration
        options often employed by enterprise administrators, and by using
        stateful DHCPv6, administrators correlating system logs know which
        system had which address at any given time. Such an accountability
        model is familiar from IPv4 management, though DHCPv6 hosts are
        identified by a DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID) rather than a MAC address. 
        For equivalent
        accountability with SLAAC (and potentially privacy addresses), a
        monitoring system that harvests IP/MAC mappings from switch and router
        equipment could be used.</t>

        <t>A common deployment consideration for any enterprise network is how
        to get host DNS records updated. Commonly, either the host will send 
	DNS updates or the DHCP server will update records. If there is 
        sufficient trust between the hosts and the DNS server, the hosts may
	update (and the enterprise may use SLAAC for addressing).  Otherwise,
	the DHCPv6 server can be configured to update the DNS server.
        Note that an enterprise network with this more controlled environment 
	will need to disable SLAAC on network segments and force end hosts to 
	use DHCPv6 only.</t>

        <t>In the data center or server room, assume a /64 per VLAN. This
        applies even if each individual system is on a separate VLAN. In a /48
        assignment, typical for a site, there are then still 65,535 /64
        blocks. Some administrators reserve a /64 but configure a small subnet,
	such as /112, /126, or /127, to prevent rogue devices from attaching 
	and getting numbers; an alternative is to monitor traffic for 
	surprising addresses or Neighbor Discovery (ND) tables for new entries. Addresses are either
	configured manually on the server or reserved on a DHCPv6 server, 
	which may also synchronize forward and reverse DNS (though see <xref 
	target="RFC6866"/> for considerations on static addressing). SLAAC is 
	not recommended for servers because of the need to synchronize RA 
	timers with DNS Times to Live (TTLs) so that the DNS entry expires at 
        the same time as the address. </t>

        <t>All user access networks should be a /64. Point-to-point links
        where NDP is not used may also utilize a /127
        (see <xref target="RFC6164"/>).</t>

        <t>Plan to aggregate at every layer of network hierarchy. There is no
        need for variable length subnet mask (VLSM) <xref target="RFC1817"/> 
        in IPv6, and addressing plans
        based on conservation of addresses are shortsighted. Use of prefixes
        longer then /64 on network segments will break common IPv6 functions
        such as SLAAC <xref target="RFC4862"/>. Where multiple VLANs or other
        Layer 2 domains converge, allow some room for expansion. Renumbering
        due to outgrowing the network plan is a nuisance, so allow room within
        it. Generally, plan to grow to about twice the current size that can
        be accommodated; where rapid growth is planned, allow for twice that
        growth. Also, if DNS (or reverse DNS) authority may be delegated to
        others in the enterprise, assignments need to be on nibble boundaries
        (that is, on a multiple of 4 bits, such as /64, /60, /56, ..., /48,
        /44), to ensure that delegated zones align with assigned prefixes.</t>

        <t>If using ULAs, it is important to note that AAAA and PTR records
        for ULAs are not recommended to be installed in the global DNS.
        Similarly, reverse (address-to-name) queries for ULA must not be sent
        to name servers outside of the organization, due to the load that such
        queries would create for the authoritative name servers for the
        ip6.arpa zone. For more details, please refer to Section 4.4 of <xref
        target="RFC4193"/>.</t>

        <t>Enterprise networks are increasingly including virtual networks where a
        single, physical node may host many virtualized addressable devices. It
        is imperative that the addressing plans assigned to these virtual
        networks and devices be consistent and non-overlapping with the
        addresses assigned to real networks and nodes. For example, a virtual
        network established within an isolated lab environment may, at a later
        time, become attached to the production enterprise network.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Tools Assessment">
        <t>Enterprises will often have a number of operational tools and
        support systems that are used to provision, monitor, manage, and
        diagnose the network and systems within their environment. These tools
        and systems will need to be assessed for compatibility with IPv6. The
        compatibility may be related to the addressing and connectivity of
        various devices as well as IPv6 awareness of the tools and processing
        logic.</t>

        <t>The tools within the organization fall into two general categories:
        those that focus on managing the network and those that are focused
        on managing systems and applications on the network. In either
        instance, the tools will run on platforms that may or may not be
        capable of operating in an IPv6 network. This lack in functionality
        may be related to operating system version or based on some hardware
        constraint. Those systems that are found to be incapable of utilizing
        an IPv6 connection, or which are dependent on an IPv4 stack, may need
        to be replaced or upgraded.</t>

        <t>In addition to devices working on an IPv6 network natively, or via
        a transition tunnel, many tools and support systems may require
        additional software updates to be IPv6 aware or even a hardware
        upgrade (usually for additional memory, IPv6 addresses are larger and
        for a while, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses will coexist in the tool). This
        awareness may include the ability to manage IPv6 elements and/or
        applications in addition to the ability to store and utilize IPv6
        addresses.</t>

        <t>Considerations when assessing the tools and support systems may
        include the fact that IPv6 addresses are significantly larger than
        IPv4, requiring data stores to support the increased size. Such issues
        are among those discussed in <xref target="RFC5952"/>. Many
        organizations may also run dual-stack networks; therefore, the tools
        need to not only support IPv6 operation but may also need to support
        the monitoring, management, and intersection with both IPv6 and IPv4
        simultaneously. It is important to note that managing IPv6 is not just
        constrained to using large IPv6 addresses, but also that IPv6
        interfaces and nodes are likely to use two or more addresses as part
        of normal operation. Updating management systems to deal with these
        additional nuances will likely consume time and considerable
        effort.</t>

        <t>For networking systems, like node management systems, it is not
        always necessary to support local IPv6 addressing and connectivity.
        Operations such as SNMP MIB polling can occur over IPv4 transport
        while seeking responses related to IPv6 information. Where this may
        seem advantageous to some, it should be noted that without local IPv6
        connectivity, the management system may not be able to perform all
        expected functions -- such as reachability and service checks.</t>

        <t>Organizations should be aware that changes to older IPv4-only SNMP
        MIB specifications have been made by the IETF and are related to legacy
        operation in <xref target="RFC2096"/> and <xref target="RFC2011"/>.
        Updated specifications are now available in <xref target="RFC4292"/>
        and <xref target="RFC4293"/> that modified the older MIB framework to
        be IP protocol agnostic, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6. Polling
        systems will need to be upgraded to support these updates as well as
        the end stations, which are polled.</t>

    <section anchor="External_Phase" title="External Phase">
      <t>The External Phase for enterprise IPv6 adoption covers topics that
      deal with how an organization connects its infrastructure to the
      external world. These external connections may be toward the Internet at
      large or to other networks. The External Phase covers connectivity,
      security and monitoring of various elements, and outward-facing or
      accessible services.</t>

      <section title="Connectivity">
        <t>The enterprise will need to work with one or more service providers
        to gain connectivity to the Internet or transport service
        infrastructure such as a BGP/MPLS IP VPN as described in <xref
        target="RFC4364"/> and <xref target="RFC4659"/>. One significant
        factor that will guide how an organization may need to communicate
        with the outside world will involve the use of PI and/or PA IPv6 space.</t>

        <t>Enterprises should be aware that, depending on which address type
        they selected (PI vs. PA) in their planning phase, they may need to
        implement new routing functions and/or behaviors to support their
        connectivity to the ISP. In the case of PI, the upstream ISP may offer
        options to route the prefix (typically a /48) on the enterprise's
        behalf and update the relevant routing databases. Otherwise, the
        enterprise may need to perform this task on their own and use BGP to
        inject the prefix into the global BGP system.</t>

        <t>Note that the rules set by the RIRs for an enterprise acquiring PI
        address space have changed over time. For example, in the European
        region, the RIPE-NCC no longer requires an enterprise to be multihomed
        to be eligible for an IPv6 PI allocation. Requests can be made
        directly or via a LIR. It is possible that the rules may change again
        and may vary between RIRs.</t>

        <t>When seeking IPv6 connectivity to a service provider, native IPv6
        connectivity is preferred since it provides the most robust and
        efficient form of connectivity. If native IPv6 connectivity is not
        possible due to technical or business limitations, the enterprise may
        utilize readily available transition tunnel IPv6 connectivity. There
        are IPv6 transit providers that provide robust tunneled IPv6
        connectivity that can operate over IPv4 networks. It is important to
        understand the transition-tunnel mechanism used and to consider that
        it will have higher latency than native IPv4 or IPv6, and may have
        other problems, e.g., related to MTUs.</t>

        <t>It is important to evaluate MTU considerations when adding IPv6
        to an existing IPv4 network. It is generally desirable to have the
        IPv6 and IPv4 MTU congruent to simplify operations (so the two address
	families behave similarly, that is, as expected). If the enterprise
        uses transition tunnels inside or externally for IPv6 connectivity,
        then modification of the MTU on hosts/routers may be needed as
        mid-stream fragmentation is no longer supported in IPv6. It is
        preferred that Path MTU Discovery (pMTUD) be used to optimize the MTU, so erroneous
        filtering of the related ICMPv6 message types should be monitored.
        Adjusting the MTU may be the only option if undesirable upstream
        ICMPv6 filtering cannot be removed.</t>

      <section title="Security">
        <t>The most important part of security for external IPv6 deployment is
        filtering and monitoring. Filtering can be done by stateless ACLs or a
        stateful firewall. The security policies must be consistent for IPv4
        and IPv6 (or else the attacker will use the less-protected protocol
        stack), except that certain ICMPv6 messages must be allowed through
        and to the filtering device (see <xref target="RFC4890"/>):</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
	    <t>Packet Too Big: essential to allow Path MTU discovery to work</t>
            <t>Parameter Problem</t>
   	    <t>Time Exceeded</t>
          </list></t>

	<t>In addition, NDP messages (including
	Neighbor Solicitation, RAs, etc.) are required for 
	local hosts.</t>

        <t>It could also be safer to block all fragments where the transport
        layer header is not in the first fragment to avoid attacks as
        described in <xref target="RFC5722"/>. Some filtering devices allow
        this filtering. Ingress filters and firewalls should follow <xref 
	target="RFC5095"/> in handling routing extension header type 0,
	dropping the packet and sending ICMPv6 Parameter Problem, unless
	Segments Left = 0 (in which case, ignore the header).</t>

        <t>If an IPS is used for IPv4 traffic,
        then an IPS should also be used for IPv6 traffic. In general, make
        sure IPv6 security is at least as good as IPv4. This also includes all
        email content protection (anti-spam, content filtering, data leakage
        prevention, etc.).</t>

        <t>The edge router must also implement anti-spoofing techniques based
        on <xref target="RFC2827"/> (also known as BCP 38).</t>

        <t>In order to protect the networking devices, it is advised to
        implement control plane policing as per <xref target="RFC6192"/>.</t>

        <t>The potential NDP cache exhaustion attack (see <xref
        target="RFC6583"/>) can be mitigated by two techniques:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Good NDP implementation with memory utilization limits as well
            as rate limiters and prioritization of requests.</t>

            <t>Or, as the external deployment usually involves just a couple
            of exposed statically configured IPv6 addresses (virtual addresses
            of web, email, and DNS servers), then it is straightforward to
            build an ingress ACL allowing traffic for those addresses and
            denying traffic to any other addresses. This actually prevents the
            attack as a packet for a random destination will be dropped and
            will never trigger a neighbor resolution.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Monitoring">
        <t>Monitoring the use of the Internet connectivity should be done for
        IPv6 as it is done for IPv4. This includes the use of
        IPFIX <xref target="RFC7012"/> to report abnormal
        traffic patterns (such as port scanning, SYN flooding, and related IP
        source addresses) from monitoring tools and evaluating data read from
        SNMP MIBs <xref target="RFC4293"/> (some of which also enable the
        detection of abnormal bandwidth utilization) and syslogs (finding 
	server and system errors). Where NetFlow is used, Version 9 is required 
	for IPv6 support. Monitoring systems should be able to examine IPv6
	traffic, use IPv6 for connectivity, and record IPv6 addresses, and any log
	parsing tools and reporting need to support IPv6. Some of this data 
	can be sensitive (including personally identifiable information) and 
	care in securing it should be taken, with periodic purges. Integrity 
	protection on logs and sources of log data is also important to 
	detect unusual behavior (misconfigurations or attacks).  Logs may be 
	used in investigations, which depend on trustworthy data sources 
	(tamper resistant).
 </t>

	<t>In addition, monitoring of external services (such as web sites) 
	should be made address specific, so that people are notified when 
	either the IPv4 or IPv6 version of a site fails.</t> 
      </section>

      <section title="Servers and Applications">
        <t>The path to the servers accessed from the Internet usually involves
        security devices (firewall and IPS), server load balancing (SLB), and real
        physical servers. The latter stage is also multi-tiered for
        scalability and security between presentation and data storage. The
        ideal transition is to enable native dual stack on all devices; but 
	as part of the phased approach, operators have used the following 
	techniques with success:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Use a network device to apply NAT64 and basically translate an
            inbound TCP connection (or any other transport protocol) over IPv6
            into a TCP connection over IPv4. This is the easiest to deploy as
            the path is mostly unchanged, but it hides all IPv6 remote users
            behind a single IPv4 address, which leads to several audit trail
            and security issues (see <xref target="RFC6302"/>).</t>

            <t>Use the server load balancer, which acts as an application proxy
            to do this translation. Compared to the NAT64, it has the
            potential benefit of going through the security devices as native
            IPv6 (so more audit and trace abilities) and is also able to
            insert an HTTP X-Forward-For header that contains the remote IPv6
            address. The latter feature allows for logging and rate limiting
            on the real servers based on the IPV6 address even if those
            servers run only IPv4.</t>
          </list></t>

	<t>In either of these cases, care should be taken to secure logs for
	privacy reasons and to periodically purge them.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Network Prefix Translation for IPv6">
        <t>Network Prefix Translation for IPv6, or NPTv6 as described in <xref
        target="RFC6296"/>, provides a framework to utilize prefix ranges
        within the internal network that are separate (address independent)
        from the assigned prefix from the upstream provider or registry. As
        mentioned above, while NPTv6 has potential use cases in IPv6 networks,
        the implications of its deployment need to be fully understood,
        particularly where any applications might embed IPv6 addresses in
        their payloads.</t>

        <t>Use of NPTv6 can be chosen independently from how addresses are
        assigned and routed within the internal network, how prefixes are
        routed towards the Internet, or whether PA or PI addresses are
        used.</t>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Internal Phase">
      <t>This phase deals with the delivery of IPv6 to the internal
      user-facing side of the Information Technology (IT) infrastructure, which comprises various
      components such as network devices (routers, switches, etc.), end-user
      devices and peripherals (workstations, printers, etc.), and internal
      corporate systems.</t>

      <t>An important design paradigm to consider during this phase is
      "dual stack when you can, tunnel when you must".  Dual stacking allows a
      more robust, production-quality IPv6 network than is typically
      facilitated by internal use of transition tunnels that are harder to
      troubleshoot and support, and that may introduce scalability and
      performance issues. Of course, tunnels may still be used in production
      networks, but their use needs to be carefully considered, e.g., where the
      transition tunnel may be run through a security or filtering device.
      Tunnels do also provide a means to experiment with IPv6 and gain some
      operational experience with the protocol. <xref target="RFC4213"/>
      describes various transition mechanisms in more detail. <xref
      target="RFC6964"/> suggests operational guidance when
      using Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) tunnels 
      <xref target="RFC5214"/>, though we would recommend
      use of dual stack wherever possible.</t>

      <section title="Security">
        <t>IPv6 must be deployed in a secure way. This means that all existing
        IPv4 security policies must be extended to support IPv6; IPv6 security
        policies will be the IPv6 equivalent of the existing IPv4 ones (taking
        into account the difference for <xref target="RFC4890">ICMPv6</xref>).
        As in IPv4, security policies for IPv6 will be enforced by firewalls,
        ACL, IPS, VPN, and so on.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC4941">Privacy extension addresses</xref> raise a
        challenge for an audit trail as explained in <xref
        target="ipv6_security_specifics"/> of this document. The enterprise may choose to
        attempt to enforce use of DHCPv6 or deploy monitoring tools that
        harvest accountability data from switches and routers (thus making the
        assumption that devices may use any addresses inside the network).</t>

        <t>One major issue is threats against ND. This means, 
	for example, that the internal network at the access layer (where hosts
	connect to the network over wired or wireless) should implement <xref 
	target="RFC6105">RA-Guard</xref> and the techniques being specified by the
	<xref target="RFC6959">SAVI WG</xref>; 
        see also <xref
        target="ipv6_security_specifics"/> of this document for more information.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Network Infrastructure">
        <t>The typical enterprise network infrastructure comprises a
        combination of the following network elements -- wired access switches,
        wireless access points, and routers (although it is fairly common to
        find hardware that collapses switching and routing functionality into
        a single device). Basic wired access switches and access points
        operate only at the physical and link layers and don't really have
        any special IPv6 considerations other than being able to support IPv6
        addresses themselves for management purposes. In many instances, these
        devices possess a lot more intelligence than simply switching packets.
        For example, some of these devices help assist with link-layer
        security by incorporating features such as ARP inspection and DHCP
        snooping, or they may help limit where multicast floods by using IGMP
        (or, in the case of IPv6, Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD)) snooping.</t>

        <t>Another important consideration in enterprise networks is first-hop
        router redundancy. This directly ties into network reachability from
        an end host's point of view. IPv6 ND <xref
        target="RFC4861"/> provides a node with the capability to maintain a
        list of available routers on the link, in order to be able to switch
        to a backup path should the primary be unreachable. By default, ND
        will detect a router failure in 38 seconds and cycle onto the next
        default router listed in its cache. While this feature provides a
        basic level of first-hop router redundancy, most enterprise IPv4
        networks are designed to fail over much faster. Although this delay
        can be improved by adjusting the default timers, care must be taken to
        protect against transient failures and to account for increased
        traffic on the link. Another option in which to provide robust first-hop
        redundancy is to use the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol Version 3 
        (VRRPv3) for IPv6 <xref target="RFC5798"/>. This protocol provides a much
        faster switchover to an alternate default router than default ND
        parameters. Using VRRPv3, a backup router can take over for a failed
        default router in around three seconds (using VRRPv3 default
        parameters). This is done without any interaction with the hosts and a
        minimum amount of VRRP traffic.</t>

        <t>Last but not least, one of the most important design choices to
        make while deploying IPv6 on the internal network is whether to use
        SLAAC <xref
        target="RFC4862"/>, the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6
        (DHCPv6) <xref target="RFC3315"/>, or a combination thereof. Each
        option has advantages and disadvantages, and the choice will
        ultimately depend on the operational policies that guide each
        enterprise's network design. For example, if an enterprise is looking
        for ease of use, rapid deployment, and less administrative overhead,
        then SLAAC makes more sense for workstations. Manual or DHCPv6
        assignments are still needed for servers, as described in the Address Plan and External Phase
        sections of this document; see Sections <xref target="Address_Plan" format="counter"/> and <xref target="External_Phase" format="counter"/>, respectively. However, if the
        operational policies call for precise control over IP address
        assignment for auditing, then DHCPv6 may be preferred. DHCPv6 also
        allows you to tie into DNS systems for host entry updates and gives
        you the ability to send other options and information to clients. It
        is worth noting that in general operation, RAs are still needed in
        DHCPv6 networks, as there is no DHCPv6 Default Gateway option.
        Similarly, DHCPv6 is needed in RA networks for other configuration
        information, e.g., NTP servers or, in the absence of support for DNS
        resolvers in RAs <xref target="RFC6106"/>, DNS resolver
        information.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="End-User Devices">
        <t>Most operating systems (OSes) that are loaded on workstations and
        laptops in a typical enterprise support IPv6 today. However, there are
        various out-of-the-box nuances that one should be mindful about. For
        example, the default behavior of OSes vary; some may have IPv6 turned
        off by default, some may only have certain features such as privacy
        extensions to IPv6 addresses (RFC 4941) turned off, while others have
        IPv6 fully enabled. Further, even when IPv6 is enabled, the choice of
        which address is used may be subject to source address selection (RFC
        6724) and Happy Eyeballs (RFC 6555). Therefore, it is advised that
        enterprises investigate the default behavior of their installed OS
        base and account for it during the Inventory Phases of their IPv6
        preparations. Furthermore, some OSes may have some transition
        tunneling mechanisms turned on by default, and in such cases, it is
        recommended to administratively shut down such interfaces unless
        required.</t>

        <t>It is important to note that it is recommended that IPv6 be
        deployed at the network and system infrastructure level before it is
        rolled out to end-user devices; ensure IPv6 is running and routed on
        the wire, and secure and correctly monitored, before exposing IPv6 to
        end users.</t>

        <t>Smartphones and tablets are significant IPv6-capable platforms, 
	depending on the support of the carrier's data network.</t>

        <t>IPv6 support for peripherals varies. Much like servers, printers are
	generally configured with a static address (or DHCP reservation) so
	clients can discover them reliably. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Corporate Systems">
        <t>No IPv6 deployment will be successful without ensuring that all the
        corporate systems that an enterprise uses as part of its IT
        infrastructure support IPv6. Examples of such systems include, but are
        not limited to, email, video conferencing, telephony (VoIP), DNS,
        RADIUS, etc. All these systems must have their own detailed IPv6
        rollout plan in conjunction with the network IPv6 rollout. It is
        important to note that DNS is one of the main anchors in an enterprise
        deployment, since most end hosts decide whether or not to use IPv6
        depending on the presence of IPv6 AAAA records in a reply to a DNS
        query. It is recommended that system administrators selectively turn
        on AAAA records for various systems as and when they are IPv6 enabled;
        care must be taken though to ensure all services running on that host
        name are IPv6 enabled before adding the AAAA record. Care with web 
	proxies is advised; a mismatch in the level of IPv6 support between 
	the client, proxy, and server can cause communication problems.  All
        monitoring and reporting tools across the enterprise will need to be
        modified to support IPv6.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="IPv6 Only">
      <t>Early IPv6 enterprise deployments have generally taken a dual-stack
      approach to enabling IPv6, i.e., the existing IPv4 services have not been
      turned off. Although IPv4 and IPv6 networks will coexist for a long
      time, the long-term enterprise network roadmap should include steps to
      simplify engineering and operations by deprecating IPv4 from the 
      dual-stack network. In some extreme cases, deploying dual-stack networks 
      may not even be a viable option for very large enterprises due to the 
      address space described in RFC 1918 not being large enough to support 
      the network's 
      growth. In such cases, deploying IPv6-only networks might be the only 
      choice available to sustain network growth. In other cases, there may be 
      elements of an otherwise dual-stack network that may be run in IPv6 only.</t>

      <t>If nodes in the network don't need to talk to an IPv4-only node, then
      deploying IPv6-only networks should be straightforward. However, most
      nodes will need to communicate with some IPv4-only nodes; an IPv6-only 
      node may, therefore, require a translation mechanism.  As <xref 
      target="RFC6144"/> points out, it is important to look at address 
      translation as a transition strategy towards running an IPv6-only 
      network.</t>

      <t>There are various stateless and stateful IPv4/IPv6 translation
      methods available today that help IPv6-to-IPv4 communication. RFC 6144
      provides a framework for IPv4/IPv6 translation and describes in detail
      various scenarios in which such translation mechanisms could be used.
      <xref target="RFC6145"/> describes stateless address translation. In
      this mode, a specific IPv6 address range will represent IPv4 systems
      (IPv4-converted addresses), and the IPv6 systems have addresses
      (IPv4-translatable addresses) that can be algorithmically mapped to a
      subset of the service provider's IPv4 addresses. NAT64 <xref
      target="RFC6146"/> describes stateful address translation. As
      the name suggests, the translation state is maintained between IPv4
      address/port pairs and IPv6 address/port pairs, enabling IPv6 systems to
      open sessions with IPv4 systems. DNS64 <xref target="RFC6147"/>
      describes a mechanism for synthesizing AAAA resource records (RRs) from
      A RRs. Together, RFCs 6146 and RFC 6147 provide a viable method for an
      IPv6-only client to initiate communications to an IPv4-only server. As
      described in Enterprise Assumptions, <xref target='Enterprise_Assumptions'/>, 
      the administrator will usually
      want most traffic or flows to be native and only translate as needed.</t>

      <t>The address translation mechanisms for the stateless and stateful
      translations are defined in <xref target="RFC6052"/>. It is important to
      note that both of these mechanisms have limitations as to which
      protocols they support. For example, RFC 6146 only defines how stateful
      NAT64 translates unicast packets carrying TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic
      only. The classic problems of IPv4 NAT also apply, e.g., handling IP
      literals in application payloads. The ultimate choice of which
      translation mechanism to chose will be dictated mostly by existing
      operational policies pertaining to application support, logging
      requirements, etc.</t>

      <t>There is additional work being done in the area of address
      translation to enhance and/or optimize current mechanisms. For example,
      <xref target="DIVI"/> describes limitations with the
      current stateless translation, such as IPv4 address sharing and
      application layer gateway (ALG) problems, and presents the concept and
      implementation of dual-stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation (dIVI) to address
      those issues.</t>

      <t>It is worth noting that for IPv6-only access networks that
      use technologies such as NAT64, the more content providers (and
      enterprises) that make their content available over IPv6, the
      less the requirement to apply NAT64 to traffic leaving the
      access network. This particular point is important for
      enterprises that may start their IPv6 deployment well into the
      global IPv6 transition. As time progresses, and given the
      current growth in availability of IPv6 content, IPv6-only
      operation using NAT64 to manage some flows will become less
      expensive to run 
      <!--[rfced] The first mention of NAT44 should include an expansion

        <t>A number of campus networks around the world have made some initial
        IPv6 deployments. This has been encouraged by their National Research
        and Education Network (NREN) backbones, having made IPv6 available
        natively since the early 2000's. Universities are a natural place for
        IPv6 deployment to be considered at an early stage, perhaps compared
        to other enterprises, as they are involved by their very nature in
        research and education.</t>

        <t>Campus networks can deploy IPv6 at their own pace; there is no need
        to deploy IPv6 across the entire enterprise from day one.  Rather,
        specific projects can be identified for an initial deployment that
        are both deep enough to give the university experience but small
        enough to be a realistic first step. There are generally three areas
        in which such deployments are currently made.</t>

        <t>In particular, those initial areas commonly approached are:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>External-facing services. Typically, the campus web presence and
            commonly also external-facing DNS and mail exchange (MX) services. This ensures
            early IPv6-only adopters elsewhere can access the campus services
            as simply and as robustly as possible.</t>

            <t>Computer science department. This is where IPv6-related
            research and/or teaching is most likely to occur, and where many
            of the next generation of network engineers are studying, so
            enabling some or all of the campus computer science department
            network is a sensible first step.</t>

            <t>The eduroam wireless network. Eduroam <xref
            target="EDUROAM"/> is the de facto wireless
            roaming system for academic networks and uses
            authentication based on 802.1X, which is agnostic to the IP version used (unlike
            web-redirection gateway systems). Making a campus' eduroam network
            dual stack is a very viable early step.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The general IPv6 deployment model in a campus enterprise will still
        follow the general principles described in this document. While the
        above early stage projects are commonly followed, these still require
        the campus to acquire IPv6 connectivity and address space from their
        NREN (or other provider in some parts of the world) and to enable
        IPv6 on the wire on at least part of the core of the campus network.
        This implies a requirement to have an initial address plan, and to
        ensure appropriate monitoring and security measures are in place, as
        described elsewhere in this document.</t>

        <t>Campuses that have deployed to date do not use ULAs, nor do they
        use NPTv6. In general, campuses have very stable PA-based address
        allocations from their NRENs (or their equivalent). However, campus
        enterprises may consider applying for IPv6 PI; some have already done
        so. The discussions earlier in this text about PA vs. PI still
        apply.</t>

        <t>Finally, campuses may be more likely than many other enterprises to
        run multicast applications, such as IP TV or live lecture or seminar
        streaming, so they may wish to consider support for specific IPv6 multicast
        functionality, e.g., the Embedded Rendezvous Point (Embedded-RP) 
        <xref target="RFC3956"/> in routers
        and MLDv1 and MLDv2 snooping in switches.</t>
