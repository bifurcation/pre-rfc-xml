    <section title="Introduction">
    

      <t>This memo deprecates a portion of the Management Information Base
      (MIB), MIB module NAT-MIB, for devices implementing the Network Address
      Translator (NAT) function.  New implementations are encouraged to base
      themselves upon the second version of this MIB module, NATV2-MIB, defined
      in <xref target="RFC7569"/>. NAT types and their
      characteristics are defined in <xref target="RFC2663"/>.  Traditional NAT
      function, in particular, is defined in <xref target="RFC3022"/>.  Neither
      NAT-MIB nor NATV2-MIB addresses firewall functions, and neither can
      be used for configuring or monitoring them. </t> 
        
      <t><xref target="snmp"/> provides references to the Simple
      Network Management Protocol (SNMP) management framework, which
      was used as the basis for the original MIB module definition
      and its deprecation. <xref target="motivation"/> provides
      motivation for the deprecation of module NAT-MIB and its
      replacement by module NATV2-MIB. <xref target="mib"/> has the
      complete NAT-MIB module definition, with the STATUS of all
      objects changed to deprecated. <xref target="secur"/> describes
      security considerations relating to NAT-MIB, basically
      relying on the security considerations in <xref
      target="RFC4008"/> and <xref target="RFC7569"/>.

        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref

    <section title="The Internet-Standard Management Framework" anchor="snmp">

      <t>For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
        Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
        RFC 3410 <xref target="RFC3410"/>.</t>

      <t>Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
        the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally
        accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Objects
        in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of
        Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB module that is
        compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 <xref
        target="RFC2578"/>, STD 58, RFC 2579 <xref target="RFC2579"/>, and STD
        58, RFC 2580 <xref target="RFC2580"/>.</t>

    <section title="Motivation For Deprecating NAT-MIB" anchor="motivation">
    
      <t>This section provides the motivation for deprecating
      the NAT-MIB module and its replacement by a new version.</t>

      <section title="Deprecated Features">

        <t>All objects defined in <xref target="RFC4008"/> have been marked with
          "STATUS deprecated" for the following reasons:

          <list style="hanging">

            <t hangText="Writability:">Experience with NAT has shown that
              implementations vary tremendously. The NAT algorithms and data
              structures have little in common across devices, and this results
              in wildly incompatible configuration parameters. Therefore, few
              implementations were ever able to claim full compliance.</t>
            <t>Lesson learned: the MIB should be read-only as much as
              possible.</t>

            <t hangText="Exposing configuration parameters:">Even in read-only
              mode, many configuration parameters were exposed by <xref
                target="RFC4008"/> (e.g., timeouts). Since implementations vary
              wildly in their sets of configuration parameters, few
              implementations could claim even basic compliance.</t>
            <t>Lesson learned: the NAT-MIB's purpose is not to expose
              configuration parameters.</t>

            <t hangText="Interfaces:">Objects from <xref target="RFC4008"/> tie
              NAT state with interfaces (e.g., the interface table, the way map
              entries are grouped by interface). Many NAT implementations either
              never keep track of the interface or associate a mapping to a set
              of interfaces. Since interfaces are at the core of <xref
                target="RFC4008"/>, many NAT devices were unable to have a
              proper implementation.</t>
            <t>Lesson learned: NAT is a logical function that may be independent
              of interfaces. Do not tie NAT state with interfaces.</t>

            <t hangText="NAT service types:"><xref target="RFC4008"/> used four
              categories of NAT service: basicNat, napt, bidirectionalNat,
              twiceNat. These are ill-defined, and many implementations either
              use different categories or do not use categories at all.</t>
            <t>Lesson learned: do not try to categorize NAT types.</t>

            <t hangText="Limited transport protocol set:">The set of transport
              protocols was defined as: other, icmp, udp, and tcp.
              Furthermore, the numeric values corresponding to those labels were
              arbitrary, without relation to the actual standard protocol
              numbers. This meant that NAT implementations were limited to those
              protocols and were unable to expose information about DCCP, SCTP,
              etc.</t>
            <t>Lesson learned: use standard transport protocol numbers.</t>

          </list>

        </t>

      </section>

      <section title="Desirable New Features">

        <t>A number of desirable new features have been identified
        that are not present in NAT-MIB. See the latter part of
	Section 2 of
        <xref target="RFC7569"/>.</t>
