      <t>NTP format timestamps are used by several RTP protocols for
      synchronisation and statistical measurements. This memo specifies 
      Session Description Protocol (SDP)
      signalling that identifies timestamp reference clock sources and SDP
      signalling that identifies the media clock sources in a multimedia
      session.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>RTP protocols use NTP format timestamps to facilitate multimedia
      session synchronisation and to provide estimates of round-trip time
      (RTT) and other statistical parameters.</t>

      <t>Information about media clock timing exchanged in NTP format
      timestamps may come from a clock that is synchronised to a global time
      reference, but this cannot be assumed, nor is there a standardised
      mechanism available to indicate that timestamps are derived from a
      common reference clock. Therefore, RTP implementations typically assume
      that NTP timestamps are taken using unsynchronised clocks and must
      compensate for absolute time differences and rate differences. Without a
      shared reference clock, RTP can time align flows from the same source at
      a given receiver using relative timing; however, tight synchronisation
      between two or more different receivers (possibly with different network
      paths) or between two or more senders is not possible.</t>

      <t>High performance AV systems often use a reference media clock
      distributed to all devices in the system. The reference media clock may
      be distinct from the reference clock used to provide timestamps. A
      reference media clock may be provided along with an audio or video
      signal interface, or via a dedicated clock signal (e.g., <xref
      target="SMPTE-318M-1999">genlock</xref> or <xref
      target="AES11-2009">audio word clock</xref>). If sending and receiving
      media clocks are known to be synchronised to a common reference clock,
      performance can be improved by minimising buffering and avoiding rate
      conversion.</t>

      <t>This specification defines SDP signalling of timestamp reference
      clock sources and media reference clock sources.</t>

      <t>Timestamp reference clock source and media clock signalling benefit
      applications requiring synchronised media capture or playout and low
      latency operation.</t>

      <t>Examples include, but are not limited to:</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Social TV:"><xref target="RFC7272">
 "Inter-Destination Media Synchronization (IDMS) Using the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)"</xref> defines social TV
          as the combination of media content consumption by two or more users
          at different devices and locations and real-time communication
          between those users. An example of social TV is where two or more
          users are watching the same television broadcast at different
          devices and/or locations while communicating with each other using
          text, audio, and/or video. A skew in the media playout of the two or
          more users can have adverse effects on their experience. A
          well-known use case here is one friend experiencing a goal in a
          football match well before or after other friends.</t>

          <t hangText="Video Walls:">A video wall consists of multiple
          computer monitors, video projectors, or television sets tiled
          together contiguously or overlapped in order to form one large
          screen. Each of the screens reproduces a portion of the larger
          picture. In some implementations, each screen or projector may be
          individually connected to the network and receive its portion of the
          overall image from a network-connected video server or video scaler.
          Screens are refreshed at 50 or 60 hertz or potentially faster. If
          the refresh is not synchronised, the effect of multiple screens
          acting as one is broken.</t>

          <t hangText="Networked Audio:">Networked loudspeakers, amplifiers,
          and analogue input/output (I/O) devices transmitting or receiving audio signals via
          RTP can be connected to various parts of a building or campus
          network. Such situations can, for example, be found in large
          conference rooms, legislative chambers, classrooms (especially those
          supporting distance learning), and other large-scale environments
          such as stadiums. Since humans are more sensitive to differences
          in audio delay, this use case needs even more accuracy than the
          video wall use case. Depending on the exact application, the need
          for accuracy can then be in the range of microseconds <xref
          target="Olsen"></xref>.</t>

          <t hangText="Sensor Arrays:">Sensor arrays contain many
          synchronised measurement elements producing signals that are then
          combined to form an overall measurement. Accurate capture of the
          phase relationships between the various signals arriving at each
          element of the array is critically important for proper operation.
          Examples include towed or fixed sonar arrays, seismic arrays, and
          phased arrays used in radar applications, for instance.</t>

          considered traceable time once leap seconds have been taken into
          account. <xref target="IS-GPS-200F">GPS</xref> is commonly used to
          provide a TAI traceable time reference. Some network time
          synchronisation protocols (e.g., Precision Time Protocol (PTP) <xref
          target="IEEE1588-2008"></xref> and NTP) can explicitly indicate that
          the master clock is providing a traceable time reference over the
          network.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Timestamp Reference Clock Source Signalling">
      <t>The NTP format timestamps used by RTP are taken by reading a local
      real-time clock at the sender or receiver. This local clock may be
      synchronised to another clock (time source) by some means, or it may be
      unsynchronised. A variety of methods are available to synchronise local
      clocks to a reference time source, including network time protocols
      (e.g., <xref target="RFC5905">NTP</xref> and <xref
      target="IEEE1588-2008">PTP</xref>) and radio clocks (e.g., <xref
      target="IS-GPS-200F">GPS</xref>).</t>

      <t>The following sections describe and define SDP signalling, indicating
      whether and how the local timestamping clock in an RTP sender or receiver
      is synchronised to a reference clock.</t>

      <section title="Clock Synchronisation">
        <t>Two or more local clocks that are sufficiently synchronised will
        produce timestamps for a given RTP event that can be used as if they came
        from the same clock.
        Timestamps produced in one RTP sender or receiver can be directly
        compared to a local clock in another RTP sender or receiver.</t>

        <t>The accuracy of synchronisation required is application dependent.
        See <xref target="applications">"Applications"</xref> for a
        discussion of applications and their corresponding requirements. To
        serve as a reference clock, clocks must minimally be "syntonised"
        (exactly frequency matched) to one another.</t>

        <t>Sufficient synchronisation can typically be achieved by using a
        network time protocol (e.g., NTP, 802.1AS, and IEEE 1588-2008) to
        synchronise all devices to a single master clock.</t>

        <t>Another approach is to use clocks providing a global time reference
        (e.g., GPS, Galileo, and GLONASS). This concept may be used in conjunction
        with network time protocols as some protocols (e.g., PTP and NTP) allow
        master clocks to indicate explicitly that they are providing traceable
        time.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Identifying NTP Reference Clocks">
        <t>A single NTP server is identified by a hostname (or IP address) and
        an optional port number. If the port number is not indicated, it is
        assumed to be the standard NTP port (123).</t>

        <t>Two or more NTP servers MAY be listed at the same level in the
        session description to indicate that all of the listed servers deliver
        the same reference time and may be used interchangeably. RTP senders
        and receivers are assured proper synchronisation regardless of which
        server they choose and, in support of fault tolerance, may switch
        servers while streaming.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Identifying PTP Reference Clocks">
        <t>The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) as standardised in IEEE 1588
        provides a shared reference clock in a
        network. IEEE 1588 provides sub-microsecond
        synchronisation between devices on a LAN and typically locks within
        seconds at startup. With support from Ethernet switches, IEEE 1588
        protocols can achieve nanosecond timing accuracy in LANs. Network
        interface chips and cards supporting hardware timestamping of timing-critical
		protocol messages are also available.</t>

        <t>Three flavours of IEEE 1588 are in use today:<list style="symbols">
            <t><xref target="IEEE1588-2002">IEEE 1588-2002</xref>: the
            original "Standard for a Precision Clock Synchronization Protocol
            for Networked Measurement and Control Systems". This is also known
            as IEEE1588v1 or PTPv1.</t>

            <t><xref target="IEEE1588-2008">IEEE 1588-2008</xref>: the second
            version of the "Standard for a Precision Clock Synchronization
            Protocol for Networked Measurement and Control Systems". This is a
            revised version of the original IEEE1588-2002 standard and is also
            known as IEEE1588v2 or PTPv2. IEEE 1588-2008 is not protocol
            compatible with IEEE 1588-2002.</t>

            <t><xref target="IEEE802.1AS-2011">IEEE 802.1AS</xref>: "Timing
            and Synchronization for Time Sensitive Applications in Bridged
            Local Area Networks". This is a profile of IEEE
            1588-2008 that is Layer 2 only and is for use in Audio/Video Bridged LANs as described in
            <xref target="IEEE802.1BA-2011">IEEE 802.1BA-2011</xref>.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Each IEEE 1588 clock is identified by a 64-bit Extended Unique Identifier (EUI-64) called a
        "ClockIdentity". A slave clock using one of the IEEE 1588 family of
        network time protocols acquires the ClockIdentity of the
        grandmaster clock that is the ultimate source of timing information
        for the network. A boundary clock, which is itself slaved to another
        boundary clock, or the grandmaster passes the grandmaster ClockIdentity
        through to its slaves.</t>

        <t>Several instances of the IEEE 1588 protocol may operate
        independently on a single network, forming distinct PTP domains, each
        of which may have a different grandmaster clock. As the IEEE 1588
        standards have evolved, the definition of PTP domains has changed.
        IEEE 1588-2002 identifies protocol subdomains by a textual name, but
        IEEE 1588-2008 identifies protocol domains using a numeric domain
        number. 802.1AS is a Layer 2 profile of IEEE 1588-2008 supporting a
        single numeric clock domain (0).</t>

        <t>When PTP domains are signalled via SDP, senders and receivers
        SHOULD check that both grandmaster ClockIdentity and the PTP domain match
        when determining clock equivalence.</t>

        <t>Two or more IEEE 1588 clocks MAY be listed at the same level in the
        session description to indicate that all of the listed clocks are
        candidate grandmaster clocks for the domain or deliver the same
        reference time and may be used interchangeably. RTP senders and
        receivers are assured proper synchronisation regardless of which
        synchronisation source they choose and, in support of fault tolerance,
        may switch the reference clock source while streaming.</t>

        <t>The PTP protocols employ a distributed election protocol called the
        "Best Master Clock Algorithm" (BMCA) to determine the active clock
        master. The clock master choices available to BMCA can be restricted
        or biased by configuration parameters to influence the election
        process. In some systems, it may be desirable to limit the number of
        possible PTP clock masters to avoid the need to re-signal timestamp
        reference clock sources when the clock master changes.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Identifying Global Reference Clocks">
        <t>Global reference clocks provide a source of traceable time,
        typically via a hardware radio receiver interface. Examples include
        GPS, Galileo, and GLONASS. Apart from the name of the reference clock
        system, no further identification is required.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Private Reference Clocks">
        <t>In other systems, all RTP senders and receivers may use a timestamp
        reference clock that is not provided by one of the methods listed
        above. Examples may include the reference time information provided by
        digital television or cellular services. These sources are identified
        as "private" reference clocks. All RTP senders and receivers in a
        session using a private reference clock are assumed to have a
        mechanism outside this specification for determining whether their
        timestamp reference clocks are equivalent.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="localref" title="Local Reference Clocks">
        <t><xref target="RFC3550"></xref> allows senders and receivers to either use a local
        wallclock reference for their NTP timestamps or, by setting the timestamp
        field to 0, supply no timestamps at all. Both are common practice
        in embedded RTP implementations. These clocks are identified as
        "local" and can, at best, be assumed to be equivalent to clocks originating
        from the same device.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Traceable Reference Clocks">
        <t>A timestamp reference clock source may be labelled "traceable" if
        it is known to be delivering traceable time, provided adjustments
        are made for differing epochs, timezones, and leap seconds.  Timestamps
        taken using clocks synchronised to a traceable time source can be
        directly compared even if the clocks are synchronised to different
        sources or via different mechanisms.</t>

        <t>Marking a clock as traceable allows additional information (e.g., IP
        addresses, PTP master identifiers, and the like) to be omitted from the
        SDP since any traceable clock available at the answerer is considered
        to be an appropriate timestamp reference clock. For example, an
        offerer could specify ts-refclk:ntp=/traceable/ and the answerer
        could use GPS as a reference clock since GPS is a source of traceable
        time.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="rcgrammar"
               title="SDP Signalling of Timestamp Reference Clock Source">
        <t>Specification of the timestamp reference clock source may be at any
        or all levels (session, media, or source) of an SDP description (see
        level definitions in <xref target="definitions"/> earlier in this
        document for more information).</t>

        <t>Timestamp reference clock source signalling included at the
        session level provides default parameters for all RTP sessions and
        sources in the session description. More specific signalling included
        at the media level overrides session-level signalling. More
        specific signalling included at the source level overrides
        media-level signalling.</t>

        <t>If timestamp reference clock source signalling is included anywhere
        in an SDP description, it must be properly defined for all levels in
        the description. This may simply be achieved by providing default
        signalling at the session level.</t>

        <t>Timestamp reference clock parameters may be repeated at a given
        level (i.e., for a session or source) to provide information about
        additional servers or clock sources. If the attribute is repeated at a
        given level, all clocks described at that level are assumed to be
        equivalent. Traceable time sources MUST NOT be mixed with
        non-traceable time sources at any given level.</t>

        <t>Note that clock source parameters may change from time to time, for
        example, as a result of a PTP grandmaster election. <xref
        target="RFC3261">SIP</xref> supports the re-signalling of updated
        SDP information; however, other protocols may require additional
        notification mechanisms.</t>

    <section title="Media Clock Source Signalling">
      <t>The media clock source for a stream determines the timebase used to
      advance the RTP timestamps included in RTP packets. The media clock may
      be asynchronously generated by the sender, it may be generated in fixed
      relationship to the reference clock, or it may be generated with respect
      to another stream on the network (which is presumably being received by
      the sender).</t>

      <section anchor="asyncmc" title="Asynchronously Generated Media Clock">
        <t>In the simplest sender implementation, the sender generates media
        by sampling audio or video according to a free-running local clock.
        The RTP timestamps in media packets are advanced according to this
        media clock, and packet transmission is typically timed to regular
        intervals on this timeline. The sender may or may not include an NTP
        timestamp in sender reports to allow mapping of this asynchronous
        media clock to a reference clock.</t>

        <t>The asynchronously generated media clock is the assumed mode of
        operation when there is no signalling of the media clock source.
        Alternatively, an asynchronous media clock may be explicitly
        signalled.<list>
            <t>a=mediaclk:sender</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="directmc" title="Direct-Referenced Media Clock">
        <t>A media clock may be directly derived from a reference clock. For
        this case, it is required that a reference clock be specified with an
        a=ts-refclk attribute (<xref target="rcgrammar"></xref>).</t>

        <t>The signalling optionally indicates a media clock offset value. The
        offset indicates the RTP timestamp value at the epoch (time of origin)
        of the reference clock. To use the offset, implementations need to
        compute RTP timestamps from reference clocks. To simplify these
        calculations, streams utilizing offset signalling SHOULD use a TAI
        timestamp reference clock to avoid complications introduced by leap
        seconds. See <xref target="RFC7164"/> for
        further discussion of leap-second issues in timestamp reference
        clocks.</t>

        <t>To compute the RTP timestamp against an IEEE 1588 (TAI-based)
        reference, the time elapsed between the 00:00:00 1 January 1970 IEEE
        1588 epoch and the current time must be computed. Between the epoch
        and 1 January 2013, there were 15,706 days (including extra days
        during leap years). Since there are no leap seconds in a TAI
        reference, there are exactly 86,400 seconds during each of these days
        or a total of 1,356,998,400 seconds from the epoch to 00:00:00 1
        January 2013. A 90 kHz RTP clock for a video stream would have
        advanced 122,129,856,000,000 units over this period. With a signalled
        offset of 0, the RTP clock value modulo the 32-bit unsigned
        RTP timestamp representation in the RTP header would have been 2,460,938,240 at
        00:00:00 1 January 2013. If an offset of 23,465 had been signalled,
        the clock value would have been 2,460,961,705.</t>

        <t>In order to use an NTP reference, the actual time elapsed between
        the 00:00:00 1 January 1900 NTP epoch to the current time must be
        computed. 2,208,988,800 seconds elapsed between the NTP epoch and
        00:00:00 1 January 1970 <xref target="RFC0868"></xref>. Between the
        beginning of 1970 and 2013, there were 15,706 days elapsed (including
        extra days during leap years) and 25 leap seconds inserted. There is,
        therefore, a total of 3,565,987,225 seconds from the NTP epoch to
        00:00:00 1 January 2013. A 90 kHz RTP clock for a video stream would
        have advanced 320,938,850,250,000 units over this period. With a
        signalled offset of 0, the RTP clock value modulo the 32-bit unsigned
        representation would have been 1,714,023,696 at 00:00:00 1 January
        2013.</t>

        <t>If no offset is signalled, the offset can be inferred at the
        receiver by examining RTCP sender reports that contain NTP and RTP
        timestamps, which combined define a mapping. The NTP/RTP timestamp
        mapping provided by RTCP sender reports (SRs) takes precedence over that signalled
        through SDP; however, the media clock rate implied by the SRs MUST be
        consistent with the rate signalled.</t>

        <t>A rate modifier may be specified. The modifier is expressed as the
        ratio of two integers and modifies the rate specified or implied by
        the media description by this ratio. If omitted, the rate is assumed
        to be the exact rate specified or implied by the media format. For
        example, without a rate specification, the RTP clock for an 8 kHz
        G.711 audio stream will advance exactly 8000 units for each second
        advance in the reference clock from which it is derived.</t>

        <t>The rate modifier is primarily useful for accommodating certain
        "oddball" audio sample rates associated with NTSC video (see <xref
        target="example-mediaclk-2"></xref>). Modified rates are not advised
        for video streams that generally use a 90 kHz RTP clock regardless of
        frame rate or sample rate used for embedded audio. <list>

      <section anchor="streammc" title="Stream-Referenced Media Clock">
        <t>A common synchronisation architecture for audio/visual systems
        involves distributing a reference media clock from a master device to
        a number of slave devices, typically by means of a cable. Examples
        include audio word clock distribution and video black burst
        distribution. In this case, the media clock is locally generated,
        often by a crystal oscillator, and is not locked to a timestamp
        reference clock.</t>

        <t>To support this architecture across a network, a master clock
        identifier is associated with an RTP media stream carrying media clock
        timing information from a master device. The master clock identifier
        represents a media clock source in the master device. Slave devices in
        turn associate the master media clock identifier with streams they
        transmit, signalling the synchronisation relationship between the
        master and the transmitter's media clock.</t>

        <t>Slave devices recover media clock timing from the clock master
        stream, using it to synchronise the slave's media clock with the master.
        If a common reference clock is available, NTP timestamps in the master clock RTP media stream are taken using the
        shared reference clock. The
        NTP timestamps communicate information about media clock timing (rate and
        phase) from the master to the slave devices. NTP timestamps are
        communicated in the usual RTP fashion via RTCP SRs, or via the <xref
        target="RFC6051"></xref> header extension.
		If no shared reference clock is available or signalled, a slave can synchronise to the master's media clock using RTP timestamps alone as described in Section 5.1 of <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Note that the slaving of a device media clock to a master device does
        not affect RTP inter-media synchronisation. Time-aligned
        playout of two or more RTP sources still relies upon NTP
        timestamps supplied via RTCP SRs or by the RFC 6051 timestamp header
        extension.</t>

        <t>In a given system, master clock identifiers must uniquely identify
        a single media clock source. Such identifiers MAY be manually
        configured; however, identifiers SHOULD be generated according to the
        "short-term persistent RTCP CNAME" algorithm as described in <xref
        target="RFC7022"></xref>. Master clock identifiers not already
        in base64 format MUST be encoded as base64 strings when used in SDP.
        Although the CNAME algorithm is used to generate the master clock
        identifier, it is used to tag RTP sources in SDP descriptions and does
        not appear in RTCP as a CNAME.</t>

        <t>A reference stream can be an RTP stream or an Audio Video Bridging (AVB) stream based on the
        <xref target="IEEE1722"></xref> standard.</t>

        <t>An RTP clock master stream SHOULD be identified at the source level
        by an SSRC <xref target="RFC5576"></xref> and master clock identifier.
        An RTP stream that provides media clock timing directly from a
        reference media clock (e.g., internal crystal, audio word clock, or
        video black burst signal) SHOULD tag the stream as a master clock
        source using the "src:" prefix. If master clock identifiers are
        declared at the media or session level, all RTP sources at or below
        the level of declaration MUST provide equivalent timing to a slave
        receiver.<list>

        <t>Media clock source signalling included at session level provides
        default parameters for all RTP sessions and sources in the session
        description. More specific signalling included at the media level

        signalling overrides media clock source signalling at the enclosing

        <t>Media clock source signalling may be present or absent on a

    <section anchor="sigconsid" title="Signalling Considerations">
      <t>Signalling of <xref target="rcgrammar">timestamp reference clock
      source</xref> and <xref target="mcgrammar">media clock source</xref> is
      defined to be used either by applications that implement the SDP
      Offer/Answer model <xref target="RFC3264"></xref> or by applications that
      use SDP to describe media and transport configurations.</t>

      <t>A description SHOULD include both reference clock signalling and
      media clock signalling. If no reference clock is available, this SHOULD
      be signalled as a <xref target="localref">local reference</xref>.</t>

      <t>When no media clock signalling is present, an asynchronous media
      clock (<xref target="asyncmc"></xref>) MUST be assumed. When no
      reference clock signalling is present, a local reference clock (<xref
      target="localref"></xref>) MUST be assumed.</t>

      <t>If a reference clock is not signalled or a local reference is
      specified, the corresponding media clock may be established as rate
      synchronised with no assurance of time synchronisation.</t>

      <t>When the description signals a direct-referenced media clock (<xref
      target="directmc"></xref>), reference clock signalling is REQUIRED.
      Asynchronous and stream-referenced media clocks (<xref
      target="streammc"></xref>) MAY be specified with or without a reference
      clock signalling.</t>

      <section title="Usage in Offer/Answer">
        <t>During offer/answer, clock source signalling via SDP uses a
        declarative model. Supported media and/or reference clocks are
        specified in the offered SDP description. The answerer may accept or
        reject the offer in an application-specific way depending on the
        clocks that are available and the clocks that are offered. For
        example, an answerer may choose to accept an offer that lacks a common
        clock by falling back to a lower-performance mode of operation (e.g.,
        by assuming reference or media clocks are local rather than shared).
        Conversely, the answerer may choose to reject the offer when the
        offered clock specifications indicate that the available reference
        and/or media clocks are incompatible.</t>

        <t>While negotiation of reference clock and media clock attributes is
        not defined in this document, negotiation MAY be accomplished using
        the capabilities negotiation procedures defined in <xref
        target="RFC5939"></xref>.</t>

        <section title="Indicating Support for Clock Source Signalling">
          <t>An offerer or answerer indicates support for media clock
          signalling by including a reference or media clock specification in
          the SDP description. An offerer or answerer without specific
          reference or media clocks to signal SHOULD indicate support for
          clock source signalling by including a <xref target="localref">local
          reference clock</xref> specification in the SDP description.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Timestamp Reference Clock">
          <t>If one or more of the reference clocks specified in the offer are
          usable by the answerer, the answerer SHOULD respond with an answer
          containing the subset of reference clock specifications in the offer
          that are usable by the answerer. If the answerer rejects the offer
          because the available reference clocks are incompatible, the
          rejection MUST contain at least one timestamp reference clock
          specification usable by the answerer so that appropriate information
          is available for diagnostics. If no external reference clock is
          available to the answerer, a <xref target="localref">local reference
          clock</xref> specification SHOULD be included in the rejection.</t>

          <t>In both offers and answers, multiple reference clock
          specifications indicate equivalent clocks from different sources
          that may be used interchangeably. RTP senders and receivers are
          assured proper synchronisation regardless of which of the specified
          sources is chosen and, in support of fault tolerance, may switch
          clock sources while streaming.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Media Clock">
          <t>If the media clock mode specified in the offer is acceptable to
          the answerer, the answerer SHOULD respond with an answer containing
          the same media clock specification as the offer. If the answerer
          rejects the offer because the available reference clocks are
          incompatible, the rejection MUST contain a media clock specification
          supported by the answerer so that appropriate information is
          available for diagnostics. If no shared media clocks are available to
          the answerer, an <xref target="asyncmc">asynchronous media
          clock</xref> specification SHOULD be included in the rejection.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Usage Outside of Offer/Answer">
        <t>SDP can be employed outside of the offer/answer context, for
        instance, for multimedia sessions that are announced through the
        Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) <xref target="RFC2974"></xref> or
        streamed through the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) <xref
        target="RFC2326"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Devices using published descriptions to join sessions SHOULD assess
        their synchronisation compatibility with the described session based
        on the clock source signalling and SHOULD NOT attempt to join a
        session with incompatible reference or media clocks.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Entities receiving and acting upon an SDP message should note that a
      session description cannot be trusted unless it has been obtained by an
      authenticated transport protocol from a known and trusted source. Many
      different transport protocols may be used to distribute a session
      description, and the nature of the authentication will differ from
      transport to transport. For some transports, security features are often
      not deployed. In case a session description has not been obtained in a
      trusted manner, the endpoint should exercise care because, among other
      attacks, the media sessions received may not be the intended ones, the
      destination where media is sent to may not be the expected one, and any of
      the parameters of the session may be incorrect.</t>

      <t>Incorrect reference or media clock parameters may cause devices or
      streams to synchronise to unintended clock sources. Normally, this simply
      results in failure to establish a session or failure to synchronise once
      connected. Enough devices fraudulently assigned to a specific clock
      source (e.g., a particular IEEE 1588 grandmaster) may, however,
      constitute a successful denial-of-service attack on that source. Devices
      MAY wish to validate the integrity of the clock description through some
      means before connecting to unfamiliar clock sources.</t>

      <t>The timestamp reference clocks negotiated by this protocol are used
      to provide media timing information to RTP. Negotiated timestamp
      reference clocks should not be relied upon to provide a secure time
      reference for security critical operations (e.g., the expiration of
      public key certificates).</t>

      <t>This document defines two new SDP attributes: "ts-refclk" and
      "mediaclk", within the existing Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
      (IANA) registry of SDP Parameters.</t>

      IANA SDP Parameters registry: the Media Clock Source Parameters
      registry. Within this new registry, this document defines an initial set
      of three media clock source parameters. Further, this document defines a
      second new IANA registry subordinate to the IANA SDP Parameters
      registry: the Timestamp Reference Clock Source Parameters registry.
