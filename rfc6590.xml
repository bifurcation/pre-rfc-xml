                <t> Email messages often contain information that
                    might be considered private or sensitive, per
                    either regulation or social norms.  When such a
                    message becomes the subject of a report intended
                    to be shared with other entities, the report
                    generator may wish to redact or elide the
                    sensitive portions of the message.  This memo
                    suggests one method for doing so effectively. </t>

                <section title="Introduction">
                <t> The Abuse Reporting Format <xref target="ARF"/> defines a message format for
                    sending reports of abuse in the messaging
                    infrastructure, with an eye toward automating 
                    both the generation and consumption of those
                    reports. </t>
                
                <t> For privacy considerations, it might be the policy
                    of a report generator to anonymize, or obscure,
                    portions of the report that might identify an end
                    user who caused the report to be generated.
                    This has come to be known in feedback loop
                    parlance as "redaction".
                    Precisely how this is done is unspecified in
                    <xref target="ARF"/>, as it will generally be a
                    matter of local policy.  That specification 
                    does admonish generators against being too
                    overzealous with this practice, as obscuring too
                    much data makes the report non-actionable. </t>

                <t> Previous redaction practices, such as replacing
                    local-parts of addresses with a uniform string
                    like "xxxxxxxx", frustrated any kind of
                    prioritizing or grouping of reports.  This memo
                    presents a practice for conducting redaction in
                    a manner that allows a report receiver to
                    detect that two reports were caused by the same
                    end user, without revealing the identity of
                    that user.  That is, the report receiver can use
                    the redacted string, such as an obscured email
                    address, to determine that two such unredacted
                    strings were identical; the reports originally
                    contained the same address. </t>

                <t> Generally, it is assumed that the
                    recipient-identifying fields of a message, when
                    copied into a report, are to be obscured to protect 
                    the identity of the end user who submitted the
                    complaint about the message.  However, it is also
                    presumed that other data will be left intact, and
                    those data could be correlated against log files
                    or other resources to determine the intended
                    recipient of the original message. </t>

                <t> When redacting of reports is desired, in order
                    to enable a report receiver to correlate reports
                    that might refer to a common but anonymous source,
                    the report generator SHOULD use the following
                    practice:
                
                    <list style="numbers">
                        <t> Select a transformation mechanism (see
                            <xref target="mechs"/>) that is
                            consistent (i.e., the same input string
                            produces the same output each time) and
                            reasonably collision-resistant (i.e., two
                            different inputs are unlikely to produce
                            the same output). </t>

                        <t> Identify string(s) (such as local-parts
                            of email addresses) in a message that need
                            to be redacted.  Call these strings the
                            "private data". </t>
                                
                        <t> For each piece of private data, apply
                            the selected transformation mechanism. </t>

                        <t> If the output of the transformation
                            can contain bytes that are not printable
                            ASCII, or if the output can include
                            characters not appropriate to replace the
                            private data directly, encode the output
                            with the base64 algorithm as defined in
                            Section 4 of <xref target="BASE64"/>, or
                            some similar translation, to form a valid
                            replacement in the original context. For
                            example, replacing a local-part in an email
                            address with transformation output
                            containing an "@" character (ASCII 0x40)
                            or a space character (ASCII 0x20) is not
                            permitted by the specification for
                            local-part <xref target="SMTP"/>, so the
                            transformation output needs to be encoded
                            as described. </t>
                                
                        <t> Replace each instance of private data with
                            the corresponding (possibly encoded)
                            transformation when generating the
                            report.  Note that the replaced text could
                            also be in a context that has constraints,
                            such as length limits that need to be
                            observed. </t>
                    </list> </t>
                
                <t> This has the effect of obscuring the data (in a
                    potentially irreversible way) while still allowing
                    the report recipient to observe that numerous
                    reports are about one particular end user.  Such
                    detection enables the receiver to prioritize its
                    reactions based on problems that appear to be
                    focused on specific end users that may be
                    under attack. </t>

                <section anchor="mechs" title="Transformation Mechanisms">
                <t> This memo does not specify a particular
                    transformation mechanism as a requirement.
                    The interoperability that this memo seeks to
                    provide is enabled by the consistency of the
                    transformation. </t>

                <t> Dealing with the issue of the security of the
                    transformation (i.e., frustrating attempts to
                    reverse the transformation)
                    is a matter of local policy.  A continuum of
                    possible transformations exists, from trivial
                    ones such as rot13, CRC32, and base64, through
                    strong cryptographic encodings such as the
                    Hashed Message Authentication Code
                    <xref target="HMAC"/> and even full encryption, or
                    private transformations such as mapping an email
                    address to an internal customer number.  An
                    operator wishing to perform report redaction needs
                    to select a consistent transformation that
                    obscures the private data and is resilient to
                    attempts to extract the original data to the
                    extent required by local policy, keeping in mind
                    that the environment in which the transformation is
                    operating is not a highly secure one.  See
                    <xref target="sec_not_redacted"/> for further
                    details of this issue. </t>

                <t> An implementation MAY choose any transformation
                    that has a reasonably low likelihood of
                    collision. </t>

                <t> Message digest collisions are a well-understood
                    issue.  Their application here involves a
                    report receiver improperly concluding that two
                    pieces of redacted information were originally the
                    same when in fact they are not.  This can lead
                    to a denial of service, where the inadvertently
                    improper application of complaint data causes
                    unjustified corrective action.  Such cases are

                <t> Although the identity of the user causing a report
                    to be generated can be obscured using this
                    mechanism, other properties of a message (such as
                    the Message-ID field) that are not redacted could
                    be used to recover the original data by locating
                    them in the message logs of the originating system
                    or via other data correlation techniques.  It is
                    incumbent on the report generator to anticipate
                    and redact or otherwise obscure such data, or
                    accept that such recovery is possible even from
                    the very simplest kinds of feedback. </t>

                    Given the ultimate recoverability of the redacted
                    information, the cryptographic strength of the
                    transformation is not a critical security
                    measure. </t>

                <t> The process of redacting a feedback report
                    satisfies a privacy requirement established by
                    local policy, and is not meant to provide strong
                    security properties. </t>

                    report producers and consumers.  The issues

                    of private data from leaking between ADministrative

                <section title="Example">
                <t> Assume the following input message:

        <figure><artwork>
  From: alice@example.com
  To: bob@example.net
  Subject: Make money fast!
  Message-ID: &lt;123456789@mailer.example.com&gt;
  Date: Thu, 17 Nov 2011 22:19:40 -0500

  http://www.example.com/scam/0xd0d0cafe
        </artwork></figure> </t>

        <t> On receipt, bob@example.net reports this message as abusive
            through whatever mechanism his mailbox provider has
            established.  This causes an <xref target="ARF"/> message to
            be generated.  However, example.net wishes to obscure Bob's
            email address lest it be relayed to the offending agent, which
            could lead to more trouble for Bob. </t>

        <t> Thus, example.net plans to redact the local-part of the recipient
            address in the To: field.  Local policy and security requirements
            suggest that the algorithm known as "H" (a hash of a key
            concatenated
            with the data to be obscured) using SHA1 is adequate.  It has
            thus selected a redaction key of "potatoes", and the private data
            in this case is the string "bob".  The concatenation of
            "potatoesbob" is digested with SHA1 and then base64-encoded to the
            string "rZ8cqXWGiKHzhz1MsFRGTysHia4=". </t>

        <t> Therefore, when constructing the ARF message in response to Bob's
            complaint, the following form of the received message is used in
            the third part of the ARF report:

        <figure><artwork>
  From: alice@example.com
  To: rZ8cqXWGiKHzhz1MsFRGTysHia4=@example.net
  Subject: Make money fast!
  Message-ID: &lt;123456789@mailer.example.com&gt;
  Date: Thu, 17 Nov 2011 22:19:40 -0500

        </artwork></figure> </t>

        <t> Note, however, that it is possible that the redacted information
            can be recovered by agents at example.com searching their logs for
            the original envelope associated with the message, by correlating
            with the Message-ID contents, which were not redacted here.  It
            is expected that feedback loops generating such reports involve
            senders that have been vetted against such information
            leakage. </t>
