      <t>This document defines IS-IS extensions to support multicast forwarding
      using the Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) architecture.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) <xref format="default"
      pageno="false" target="RFC8279"/> defines an architecture where all
      intended multicast receivers are encoded as a bitmask in the multicast
      packet header within different encapsulations such as described in <xref
      format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC8296"/>. A router that
      receives such a packet will forward the packet based on the bit position
      in the packet header towards the receiver(s) following a precomputed
      tree for each of the bits in the packet. Each receiver is represented by
      a unique bit in the bitmask.</t>

      <t>This document presents necessary extensions to the currently deployed
      IS-IS for IP <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC1195"/>
      to support distribution of information necessary for operation
      of BIER domains and subdomains. This document defines a new TLV to be
      advertised by every router participating in BIER signaling.</t>

      <t>This document defines support for MPLS encapsulation as specified in
      <xref target="RFC8296"/>. Support for other encapsulation types and the
      use of multiple encapsulation types are outside the scope of this document.</t>

      <t>This document also introduces a new registry for sub-sub-TLVs for the
      BIER Info sub-TLV. The registration policy is Expert Review
      as defined in <xref target="RFC8126"/>. The "Sub-sub-TLVs for BIER Info

        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Concepts">
      <section title="BIER Domains and Subdomains">
        <t>An IS-IS-signaled BIER domain is aligned with the scope of
        distribution of BFR-prefixes that identify the BFRs within IS-IS. In
	such a case, IS-IS acts as the supporting BIER underlay.</t>

        <t>Within such a domain, the extensions defined in this document
        advertise BIER information for one or more BIER subdomains. Each
        subdomain is uniquely identified by a subdomain-id (SD). Each
        subdomain is associated with a single IS-IS topology (MT) <xref
        format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5120"/>, which may be any
        of the topologies supported by IS-IS. Local configuration controls
        which &lt;MT,SD&gt; pairs are supported by a router. The mapping of
        subdomains to topologies MUST be consistent within the IS-IS flooding
        domain used to advertise BIER information.</t>

        <t>Each BIER subdomain has as its unique attributes the encapsulation
        used and the type of tree it uses to forward BIER frames
        (currently always SPF). Additionally, per supported BitString length
        in the subdomain, each router will advertise the necessary label
        ranges to support it.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Advertising BIER Information">
        <t>BIER information advertisements are associated with a new sub-TLV
        in the extended reachability TLVs. BIER information is always
        associated with a host prefix, which MUST be a node address for the
        advertising node. If this is not the case, the advertisement MUST be
        ignored. Therefore, the following restrictions apply:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Prefix length MUST be 32 for an IPv4 prefix or 128 for an IPv6
            prefix.</t>

            <t>When the Prefix Attributes Flags sub-TLV <xref format="default"
            pageno="false" target="RFC7794"/> is present, the N flag MUST be set and
            the R flag MUST NOT be set.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>BIER sub-TLVs MUST be included when a prefix reachability
            advertisement is leaked between levels.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Procedures">

      <section anchor="MTOPSUB" title="Multi-Topology and Subdomain">
        <t>A given subdomain is supported within one and only one topology.
        All routers in the flooding scope of the BIER sub-TLVs MUST advertise
        the same subdomain within the same multi-topology. A router receiving
        an &lt;MT,SD&gt; advertisement that does not match the locally
        configured pair MUST report a misconfiguration of the received
        &lt;MT,SD&gt; pair. All received BIER advertisements associated with
        the conflicting &lt;MT,SD&gt; pair MUST be ignored. Note that in the
        presence of such a misconfiguration, this will lead to partitioning of
        the subdomain.</t>

        <t>Example:</t>

        <t>The following combination of advertisements are valid: &lt;0,0&gt;
        &lt;0,1&gt;, and &lt;2,2&gt;.</t>

        <t>The following combination of advertisements are invalid:
        &lt;0,0&gt; &lt;0,1&gt;, and &lt;2,0&gt;. Advertisements associated with
        &lt;0,0&gt; and &lt;2,0&gt; must be ignored.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="BFR-id Advertisements">
        <t>If a BFER/BFIR is configured with a BFR-id, then it advertises this
        value in its BIER advertisements. If no BFR-id is configured, then the
        value "Invalid BFR-id" is advertised. A valid BFR-id MUST be unique
        within the flooding scope of the BIER advertisements. All BFERs/BFIRs
        MUST detect advertisement of duplicate valid BFR-IDs for a given
        &lt;MT,SD&gt;. When such duplication is detected, all of the routers
        advertising duplicates MUST be treated as if they did not advertise a
        valid BFR-id. This implies they cannot act as BFER or BFIR in that
        &lt;MT,SD&gt;.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Logging Misconfiguration">
        <t>Whenever an advertisement is received that violates any of the
        constraints defined in this document, the receiving router MUST support
        logging this occurrence. Logging SHOULD be dampened to avoid excessive
        output.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Flooding Reduction">
        <t>It is expected that changes in the BIER domain information that is
        advertised by IS-IS occur infrequently. If this expectation is not met
        for an extended period of time (more than a few seconds of burstiness),
        changes will increase the number of Link State PDU (LSP) updates and
        negatively impact performance in the network. Implementations SHOULD
        protect against this possibility by, for example, dampening updates if they
        occur over an extended period of time.</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Packet Formats" toc="default">
      <t>All IS-IS BIER information is carried within the TLVs 235, 237, <xref
      format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5120"/>, 135 <xref
      format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5305"/>, <xref
      format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5308">or 236</xref>.</t>

      <section anchor="S2L" title="BIER Info Sub-TLV">
        <t>This sub-TLV carries the information for the BIER subdomains that
        the router participates in as a BFR. This sub-TLV MAY appear multiple
        times in a given prefix-reachability TLV -- once for each subdomain
        supported in the associated topology.</t>

        <t>The sub-TLV advertises a single &lt;MT,SD&gt; combination followed
        by optional sub-sub-TLVs as described in the following sections.</t>

      <t>The Security Considerations section of <xref target="RFC8279"/>
      discusses the possibility of performing a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack
      by setting too many bits in the BitString of a BIER-encapsulated packet.
      However, this sort of DoS attack cannot be initiated by modifying the
      IS-IS BIER advertisements specified in this document. A BFIR decides
      which systems are to receive a BIER-encapsulated packet. In making this
      decision, it is not influenced by the IS-IS control messages. When
      creating the encapsulation, the BFIR sets one bit in the encapsulation
      for each destination system. The information in the IS-IS BIER
      advertisements is used to construct the forwarding tables that map each
      bit in the encapsulation into a set of next hops for the host that is
      identified by that bit, but it is not used by the BFIR to decide which bits
      to set. Hence, an attack on the IS-IS control plane cannot be used to
      cause this sort of DoS attack.</t>

      <t>While a BIER-encapsulated packet is traversing the network, a BFR
      that receives a BIER-encapsulated packet with n bits set in its
      BitString may have to replicate the packet and forward multiple copies.
      However, a given bit will only be set in one copy of the packet. This
      means that each transmitted replica of a received packet has fewer bits
      set (i.e., is targeted to fewer destinations) than the received packet.
      This is an essential property of the BIER-forwarding process as defined
      in <xref target="RFC8279"/>. While a failure of this process might cause
      a DoS attack (as discussed in the Security Considerations of <xref
      target="RFC8279"/>), such a failure cannot be caused by an attack on the
      IS-IS control plane.</t>

      <t>Further discussion of BIER-specific security considerations can be
      found in <xref target="RFC8279"/>.</t>
