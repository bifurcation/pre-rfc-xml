    <abstract>
      <t>Discovery of the correct Location Information Server (LIS) in the local access network is necessary for Devices that wish to acquire location information from the network.  A method is described for the discovery of a LIS in the access network serving a Device.  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) options for IP versions 4 and 6 are defined that specify a domain name.  This domain name is then used as input to a URI-enabled NAPTR (U-NAPTR) resolution process.
      </t>

    <section title="Introduction and Overview">
      <t>The location of a Device is a useful and sometimes necessary part of many services.  A Location Information Server (LIS) is responsible for providing that location information to Devices with attached access networks used to provide Internet access.  The LIS uses knowledge of the access network and its physical topology to generate and serve location information to Devices.
      </t>

      <t>Each access network requires specific knowledge about
      topology.  Therefore, it is important to discover the LIS that
      has the specific knowledge necessary to locate a Device, that is, the LIS that serves the current access network.  Automatic discovery is important where there is any chance of movement outside a single access network.  Reliance on static configuration can lead to unexpected errors if a Device moves between access networks.
      </t>

      <t>This document describes a process that a Device can use to discover a
LIS.  This process uses a DHCP option and the DNS.  The product of this
discovery process is an <xref target="RFC2616">HTTP</xref> or <xref
target="RFC2818">HTTPS</xref> URI that identifies a LIS.
      </t>

      <t>The URI result from the discovery process is suitable for location
configuration only; that is, the Device MUST dereference the URI using the
process described in <xref target="RFC5985">HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD)</xref>. URIs discovered in this way are not <xref target="RFC5808">"location URIs"</xref>; dereferencing one of them provides the location of the requestor only.  Devices MUST NOT embed these URIs in fields in other protocols designed to carry the location of the Device.
      </t>

      <section anchor="intro-dhcp" title="Discovery Procedure Overview">
        <t>DHCP (<xref target="RFC2131"/>, <xref target="RFC3315"/>)
        is a commonly used mechanism for providing bootstrap
        configuration information that allows a Device to operate in a specific network environment.  The DHCP information is largely static, consisting of configuration information that does not change over the period that the Device is attached to the network.  Physical location information might change over this time; however, the address of the LIS does not.  Thus, DHCP is suitable for configuring a Device with the address of a LIS.
        </t>

        <t>This document defines a DHCP option that produces a domain name that identifies the local access network in <xref target="dhcp"/>.
        </t>

        <t><xref target="u-naptr"/> describes a method that uses <xref target="RFC4848">URI-enabled NAPTR (U-NAPTR)</xref>, a Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service (DDDS) profile that produces a URI for the LIS.  The input to this process is provided by the DHCP option.
        </t>

        <t>For the LIS discovery DDDS application, an Application
        Service tag <spanx style="verb">LIS</spanx> and an Application
        Protocol tag <spanx style="verb">HELD</spanx> have been created and registered with the IANA.  Based on the domain name, this U-NAPTR application uses the two tags to determine a URI for a LIS that supports the HELD protocol.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
        <t>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
        </t>

        <t>This document also uses the term "Device" to refer to an
        end host or client consistent with its use in HELD.  In HELD
        and <xref target="RFC3693">RFC 3693</xref> parlance, the Device is also the Target.
        </t>

        <t>The term &quot;access network&quot; refers to the network
        to which a Device connects for Internet access.  The &quot;access network provider&quot; is the entity that operates the access network.  This is consistent with the definition in <xref target="RFC5687"/>, which combines the Internet Access Provider (IAP) and Internet Service Provider (ISP).  The access network provider is responsible for allocating the Device a public IP address and for directly or indirectly providing a LIS service.
        </t>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="procedure" title="LIS Discovery Procedure">
      <t>A Device that has multiple network interfaces could potentially be served by a different access network on each interface, each with a different LIS.  The Device SHOULD attempt to discover the LIS applicable to each network interface, stopping when a LIS is successfully discovered on any interface.
      </t>

      <t>The LIS discovery procedure follows this process:
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>Acquire the <xref target="dhcp">access network domain name</xref>.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        This process might be repeated for each of the network interfaces on the Device.  Domain names acquired from other sources might also be added.
        </t>

        <t>Apply <xref target="u-naptr">U-NAPTR resolution</xref> to discover a LIS URI.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        The U-NAPTR process is applied using each of the domain names as input.
        </t>

        <t>Verify that the LIS is able to provide location information.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        The first URI that results in a successful response from the LIS is used.
        </t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>A Device MUST support discovery using the <xref target="dhcp">access network domain name DHCP option</xref> as input to <xref target="u-naptr">U-NAPTR resolution</xref>.  If this option is not available, <xref target="RFC2132">DHCPv4 option 15</xref> is used.  Other domain names MAY be used, as described in <xref target="dn"/>.
      </t>

      <t>A Device that discovers a LIS URI MUST attempt to verify that the LIS is able to provide location information.  For the HELD protocol, the Device verifies the URI by making a location request to the LIS.  Any HTTP 200 response containing a HELD response signifies success.  This includes HELD error responses, with the exception of the <spanx style="verb">notLocatable</spanx> error.
      </t>

      <t>If -- at any time -- the LIS responds to a request with the <spanx style="verb">notLocatable</spanx> error code (see Section 4.3.2 of <xref target="RFC5985"/>), the Device MUST continue or restart the discovery process.  A Device SHOULD NOT make further requests to a LIS that provides a <spanx style="verb">notLocatable</spanx> error until its network attachment changes, or it discovers the LIS on an alternative network interface.
      </t>

      <t>Static configuration of a domain name or a LIS URI MAY be used.  Note that if a Device has moved from its customary location, static configuration might indicate a LIS that is unable to provide accurate location information.
      </t>

      <t>The product of the LIS discovery process for HELD is an HTTPS or HTTP URI.  Nothing distinguishes this URI from other URIs with the same scheme, aside from the fact that it is the product of this process.  Only URIs produced by the discovery process can be used for location configuration using HELD.
      </t>

      <t>The overall discovery process is summarized in <xref target="flowchart"/>.

      <section anchor="resgw" title="Residential Gateways">
        <t>The options available in residential gateways will affect the success of this algorithm in residential network scenarios.  A fixed wireline scenario is described in more detail in <xref target="RFC5687"/>, Section 3.1.  In this fixed wireline environment, an intervening residential gateway exists between the Device and the access network.  If the residential gateway does not provide the appropriate information to the Devices it serves, those Devices are unable to discover a LIS.
        </t>

        <t>Support of this specification by residential gateways ensures that the Devices they serve are able to acquire location information.  In many cases, the residential gateway configures the Devices it serves using DHCP.  A residential gateway is able to use DHCP to assist Devices in gaining access to their location information.  This can be accomplished by providing an access network domain name DHCP option suitable for LIS discovery, or by acting as a LIS directly.  To actively assist Devices, a residential gateway can either:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>acquire an access network domain name from the access network provider (possibly using DHCP) and pass the resulting value to Devices; or</t>

          <t>discover a LIS on its external interface, then provide Devices with the domain name that was used to successfully discover the LIS; or</t>

          <t>explicitly include configuration that refers to a particular LIS; or</t>
          <t>act as a LIS and directly provide location information to the Devices it serves, including providing a means to discover this service.
          </t>

        </list>
        </t>

        <t>As with Devices, configuration of a specific domain name or location information is only accurate as long as the residential gateway does not move.  If a residential gateway that relies on configuration rather than automatic discovery is moved, the Devices it serves could be provided with inaccurate information.  Devices could be led to discover a LIS that is unable to provide accurate location information, or -- if location is configured on the residential gateway -- the residential gateway could provide incorrect location information.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="vpn" title="Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)">
        <t>A Device MUST NOT attempt LIS discovery over a VPN network interface until it has attempted and failed to perform discovery on all other non-VPN interfaces.  A Device MAY perform discovery over a VPN network interface if it has first attempted discovery on non-VPN interfaces, but a LIS discovered in this way is unlikely to have the information necessary to determine an accurate location.
        </t>

        <t>Not all interfaces connected to a VPN can be detected by Devices or the software running on them. In these cases, it might be that a LIS on the remote side of a VPN is inadvertently discovered.  A LIS provides a <spanx style="verb">notLocatable</spanx> error code in response to a request that it is unable to fulfill (see <xref target="RFC5985"/>, Section 6.3).  This ensures that even if a Device discovers a LIS over the VPN, it does not rely on a LIS that is unable to provide accurate location information.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="dhcp" title="Determining a Domain Name">
      <t>DHCP provides a direct means for the access network provider to configure a Device.  The access network domain name option identifies a domain name that is suitable for service discovery within the access network.  This domain name is used as input to the U-NAPTR resolution process for LIS discovery.
      </t>

      <t>The domain name provided in this option is one owned by the access network operator.  This domain name is intended for use in discovering services within the access network.
      </t>

      <t>This document registers a DHCP option for the access network domain name for both IPv4 and IPv6.
      </t>

      <section anchor="dn-format" title="Domain Name Encoding">
        <t>This section describes the encoding of the domain name used in the DHCPv4 option defined in <xref target="dhcpv4"/> and also used in the DHCPv6 option defined in <xref target="dhcpv6"/>.
        </t>

        <t>The domain name is encoded according to Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC1035"/>.  Each label is represented as a one-octet length field followed by that number of octets.  Since every domain name ends with the null label of the root, a domain name is terminated by a length byte of zero.  The high-order two bits of every length octet MUST be zero, and the remaining six bits of the length field limit the label to 63 octets or less.  To simplify implementations, the total length of a domain name (i.e., label octets and label length octets) is restricted to 255 octets or less.
        </t>

        <figure>
          <preamble>For example, the domain <spanx style="verb">example.com.</spanx> is encoded in 13 octets as:</preamble>
          <artwork><![CDATA[

   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>Note that the length field in either option represents the length of the entire domain name encoding, whereas the length fields in the domain name encoding is the length of a single domain name label.

        <t>If a Device knows one or more alternative domain names that might be used for discovery, it MAY repeat the U-NAPTR process using those domain names as input.  For instance, static configuration of a Device might be used to provide a Device with a domain name.
        </t>

        <t><xref target="RFC2132">DHCPv4 option 15</xref> provides an indication of the domain name that a host uses when resolving hostnames in DNS.  This option is used when the DHCPv4 access domain name is not available.
        </t>

        <t>DHCPv4 option 15 might not be suitable for some network deployments.  For instance, a global enterprise could operate multiple sites, with Devices at all sites using the same value for option 15.  In this type of deployment, it might be desirable to discover a LIS local to a site.  The access domain name option can be given a different value at each site to enable discovery of a LIS at that site.
        </t>

        <t>Alternative domain names MUST NOT be used unless the access network domain name option is unsuccessful or where external information indicates that a particular domain name is to be used.
        </t>

        <t>Other domain names might be provided by a DHCP server (for example,
<xref target="RFC4702"/> for DHCPv4, <xref target="RFC4704"/> for DHCPv6).
However, these domain names could be provided without considering their use for
LIS discovery; therefore, it is not likely that these other domain names contain useful
values.

    <section anchor="u-naptr" title="U-NAPTR Resolution of a LIS URI">
      <t><xref target="RFC4848">U-NAPTR</xref> resolution for a LIS takes a domain name as input and produces a URI that identifies the LIS.   This process also requires an Application Service tag and an Application Protocol tag, which differentiate LIS-related NAPTR records from other records for that domain.
      </t>

      <t><xref target="iana-as"/> defines an Application Service tag of <spanx style="verb">LIS</spanx>, which is used to identify the location service for a given domain.

      <t>U-NAPTR resolution might produce multiple results from each iteration of the algorithm.  Order and preference values in the NAPTR record determine which value is chosen.  A Device MAY attempt to use alternative choices if the first choice is not successful.  However, if a request to the resulting URI produces a HELD <spanx style="verb">notLocatable</spanx> response, or equivalent, the Device SHOULD NOT attempt to use any alternative choices from the same domain name.
      </t>


      <t>An HTTPS LIS URI that is a product of U-NAPTR MUST be authenticated using the domain name method described in Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC2818">RFC 2818</xref>.  The domain name that is used in this authentication is the one extracted from the URI, not the one that was input to the U-NAPTR resolution process.
      </t>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The address of a LIS is usually well-known within an access network; therefore, interception of messages does not introduce any specific concerns.
      </t>

      <t>The primary attack against the methods described in this document is one that would lead to impersonation of a LIS.  The LIS is responsible for providing location information, and this information is critical to a number of network services; furthermore, a Device does not necessarily have a prior relationship with a LIS.  Several methods are described here that can limit the probability of, or provide some protection against, such an attack.  These methods MUST be applied unless similar protections are in place, or in cases -- such as an emergency -- where location information of dubious origin is arguably better than none at all.
      </t>

      <t>An attacker could attempt to compromise LIS discovery at any of three stages:
<list style="numbers">
        <t>providing a falsified domain name to be used as input to U-NAPTR</t>
        <t>altering the DNS records used in U-NAPTR resolution</t>
        <t>impersonating the LIS</t>
</list>
      </t>

<t>
 The domain name that used to authenticate the LIS is the domain name
 input to the U-NAPTR process, not the output of that process <xref target="RFC3958"/>,
 <xref target="RFC4848"/>.  As a result, the results of DNS queries do not need
 integrity protection.
</t>
<t>
 An HTTPS URI is authenticated using the method described in Section
 3.1 of <xref target="RFC2818"/>.  HTTP client implementations frequently do
not provide a means to authenticate based on a domain name other than the one
 indicated in the request URI, namely the U-NAPTR output.  

To avoid
 having to authenticate the LIS with a domain name that is different from
 the one used to identify it, a client MAY choose to reject URIs that
 contain a domain name that is different to the U-NAPTR input.  
To
 support endpoints that enforce the above restriction on URIs, network
 administrators SHOULD ensure that the domain name in the DHCP option is
 the same as the one contained in the resulting URI.
</t>
<t>
 Authentication of a LIS relies on the integrity of the domain name
 acquired from DHCP.  An attacker that is able to falsify a domain name
 circumvents the protections provided.  To ensure that the access network
 domain name DHCP option can be relied upon, preventing DHCP messages
 from being modified or spoofed by attackers is necessary.  
 Physical- or link-layer security are commonly used to reduce the
 possibility of such an attack within an access network.

DHCP
 authentication <xref target="RFC3118"/> might also provide a degree of protection
 against modification or spoofing.
</t>


      <t>A LIS that is identified by an HTTP URI cannot be authenticated.  Use of unsecured HTTP also does not meet requirements in HELD for confidentiality and integrity.  If an HTTP URI is the product of LIS discovery, this leaves Devices vulnerable to several attacks.  Lower-layer protections, such as Layer 2 traffic separation might be used to provide some guarantees.
