    <abstract>
      <t>
        At present, an IS-IS purge does not contain any information
        identifying the Intermediate System (IS) that generates the
        purge. This makes it difficult to locate the source IS.
      </t>
      <t>
        To address this issue, this document defines a TLV to be added to
        purges to record the system ID of the IS generating it.  Since
        normal Link State Protocol Data Unit (LSP) flooding does not change
        LSP contents, this TLV should propagate with the purge.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document updates RFC 5301, RFC 5304, and RFC 5310.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The IS-IS <xref target='ISO-10589'/> routing protocol has been
        widely used in large-scale IP networks because of its strong
        scalability and fast convergence.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        The IS-IS protocol floods purges throughout an area, regardless of
        which IS initiated the purge. If a network operator would like to
        investigate the cause of the purge, it is difficult to determine
        the origin of the purge. At present, the IS-IS protocol has no
        mechanism to locate the originator of a purge. To address this
        problem, this document defines a TLV to be added to purges to
        record the system ID of the IS generating the purge.
      </t>

      <t>
        Field experience has shown several circumstances where an IS can
        improperly generate a purge.  These are all due to implementation
        deficiencies or implementations that predate <xref target='ISO-TC1'/>
        and generate a purge when they receive a corrupted Link State
        Protocol Data Unit (LSP).
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Requirements Language">
      <t>
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
        this document are to be interpreted as described in
        <xref target='RFC2119'/>. 
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="The Purge Originator Identification (POI) TLV">
      <t>
        This document defines a TLV to be included in purges.  If an IS
        generates a purge, it SHOULD include this TLV in the purge with its
        own system ID.  If an IS receives a purge that does not include
        this TLV, then it SHOULD add this TLV with both its own system ID
        and the system ID of the IS from which it received the purge.
        This allows ISs receiving purges to log the system ID of the
        originator, or the upstream source of the purge.  This makes it
        much easier for the network administrator to locate the origin of
        the purge and thus the cause of the purge.  Similarly, this TLV is
        helpful to developers in lab situations.
      </t>

      <t>
        The POI TLV is defined as:
      </t>

      <list><t>
        CODE - 13
      </t>
      <t>
        LENGTH - total length of the value field.
      </t>
      <t>
        VALUE -
      </t>
         <list>
          <t>
            Number of system IDs carried in this TLV (1 octet) -- only the 
            values 1 and 2 are defined.
          </t>
          <t>
            System ID of the Intermediate System that inserted this TLV.
          </t>
          <t>
            System ID of the Intermediate System from which the purge was
            received (optional).
          </t>
         </list>
      </list>

      <t>
        The POI TLV SHOULD be found in all purges and MUST NOT be found in
        LSPs with a non-zero Remaining Lifetime.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Using the Dynamic Hostname TLV in Purges">
      <t>
        This document also extends the use of the Dynamic hostname TLV
        (type&nbsp;137) <xref target='RFC5301'/> to further aid in the rapid
        identification of the system that generated the purge.  This TLV
        MAY be included in purges.  Implementations SHOULD include one
        instance of the Dynamic hostname TLV if the POI TLV is included.  Only
        the local hostname should be inserted.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        Use of the extensions defined here, with authentication as defined
        in <xref target='RFC5304'/> or <xref target='RFC5310'/>, will result
        in the discarding of purges by legacy systems that are in strict
        conformance with either of those RFCs.  This may compromise the
        correctness/consistency of the routing database unless all ISs in
        the network support these extensions.  Therefore, all
        implementations in a domain implementing authentication MUST be
        upgraded to receive the POI TLV before any IS is allowed to
        generate a purge with the POI TLV.
      </t>
      <t>
        More interactions between the POI TLV, the Dynamic hostname TLV,
        and the Authentication TLV are described in
        <xref target='RFC6233'/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
        IANA has assigned code point 13 for the
        'Purge Originator Identification' TLV from the IS-IS 'TLV
        Codepoints' registry.  The additional values for this TLV should
        be IIH:n, LSP:y, SNP:n, and Purge:y.
      </t>
