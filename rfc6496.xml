<t>SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) specifies a method for securing Neighbor
Discovery (ND) signaling against specific threats. As defined today, SEND
assumes that the node sending an ND message is the owner of the address from
which the message is sent and/or possesses a key that authorizes the node
to act as a router, so that it is in possession of the private key or keys
used to generate the digital signature on each message. This means that
the Proxy ND signaling performed by nodes that do not possess knowledge
of the address owner's private key and/or knowledge of a router's key cannot
be secured using SEND. This document extends the current SEND specification
in order to secure Proxy ND operation.

<t>SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) <xref target="RFC3971"/> specifies a
method for
securing Neighbor Discovery (ND) signaling <xref target="RFC4861"/> against

</t>
</section>


<section title="Secure Proxy ND Overview"> 

<t> The original SEND specification <xref target="RFC3971"/> has implicitly
assumed that only the node sending a ND message is the owner of the address
from which the message is sent. This assumption does not allow proxying of ND
messages, since the advertiser is required to generate a valid RSA Signature
option, which in turn requires possession of the public-private key pair that
was used to generate a Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA), or that was
associated to a router certificate.</t>

<t>To be able to separate the roles of owner and advertiser, the
following extensions to the SEND protocol are defined:

<list style="symbols"> 

<t>A Secure Proxy ND certificate, which is a certificate authorizing an entity
to act as an ND proxy.
It is an X.509v3 certificate in which the purpose for which the certificate is
issued has been specified explicitly, as described in a companion document <xref
target="RFC6494"/>.  
Briefly, Secure Proxy ND certificates include one or more KeyPurposeId values
that can be used for authorizing proxies to sign Router Advertisement (RA)
and Redirect messages, or to sign Neighbor Advertisement (NA), 
Neighbor Solicitation (NS), or Router Solicitation (RS) messages on behalf
of other nodes. The
inclusion of this value allows the certificate owner to
perform proxying of SEND messages for a range of addresses indicated in the same
certificate. This certificate can be exchanged through the Authorization Delegation Discovery process defined in <xref target="RFC3971"/>.</t>

<t>A new Neighbor Discovery option called the Proxy Signature (PS) option.
This option
contains the hash value of the public key of the proxy, and the digital
signature of the SEND message computed with the private key of the proxy. The
hash of the public key of the proxy is computed over the public key contained
in the Secure Proxy ND certificate. When an ND message contains a PS option,
it MUST NOT contain CGA or RSA Signature options. The PS option MUST be
appended to any NDP message (NA, NS, RS, RA, and Redirect) to secure it.</t>

<t>A modification of the SEND processing rules for all ND messages:
NA, NS, RS, RA, and Redirect. When any of these messages containing a
PS option is validated, it is considered secure.</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>These extensions are applied in the following way:
<list style="symbols"> 
<t>A Secure ND Proxy that proxies ND messages on behalf of a node can use the
PS option to protect the proxied messages. This Secure ND Proxy becomes part of
the trusted infrastructure just like a SEND router. </t>

<t>The messages to be secured with the PS option are built according to <xref
target="RFC4861"/> if they are synthesized by the Secure ND Proxy, or they
result from the processing rules defined in <xref target="RFC4389"/> if they
are translated ND messages.</t>

<t>In order to allow nodes to successfully validate secured proxied messages,
the nodes MUST be aware of the Secure Proxy ND certificate (in the format
described in <xref target="RFC6494"/>) and MUST apply the modified processing
rules specified in this document. We call these nodes 'SPND nodes'. Note that
the rules for generating ND messages in SPND nodes do not change, so these
nodes behave as defined in <xref target="RFC3971"/> when they send ND
messages.</t>

<t>To allow SPND nodes to know the certification path required to validate the
public key of the proxy, devices responding to CPS (Certification Path
Solicitation) messages with CPA (Certification Path Advertisement) messages
as defined
in Section 6 of <xref target="RFC3971">the SEND specification</xref>
are extended
to support the certificate format specified in <xref target="RFC6494"/>, and
are configured with the appropriate certification path.</t>
</list>
</t>

</section>

<section title="Secure Proxy ND Specification" anchor="specification_section">


<t> A Secure ND Proxy performs all the operations described in the SEND
specification <xref target="RFC3971"/> with the addition of new processing
rules to ensure that the receiving node can identify an authorized
proxy generating a translated or synthetic SEND message for a proxied
address.</t>

<t>This is accomplished by signing the message with a private key of the
authorized Secure ND Proxy. The signature of the Secure ND Proxy is
included in a new option called the PS option. The signature is
performed over all the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) options present in the
message, and the PS option is appended as the last option in the message.</t>

<section title="Proxy Signature Option" anchor="PSO_section">
<t>
The Proxy Signature option allows signatures based on public keys to be
attached to NDP messages.  The format of the PS option is described in the
following diagram:

<section title="Modified SEND Processing Rules"> 

<t> This specification modifies the sender and receiver processing rules
defined in the <xref target="RFC3971"> SEND specification</xref>.</t>

<section title="Processing Rules for Senders">

<t>
A Secure ND Proxy MUST NOT use a key to sign NDP message types that do not
correspond to the authorization granted to the considered key. NA, NS, and RS
messages MUST be signed with a key corresponding to a Secure Proxy ND
certificate with a KeyPurposeId value <xref target="RFC6494"/> of
id-kp-sendProxiedOwner, and the source addresses of the messages MUST be
encompassed in the prefix associated to the certificate. RA and Redirect
messages MUST be signed with a key corresponding to a Secure Proxy ND
certificate with a KeyPurposeId value of id&nbhy;kp&nbhy;sendProxiedRouter. 
The prefix
included in the RA message for on-link determination and/or stateless address
autoconfiguration, and the Target Address of the Redirect message, MUST be
encompassed in the prefix associated to that certificate.</t>

<t>A secured NDP message sent by a Secure ND Proxy for a proxied address MUST
contain
a PS option and MUST NOT contain either CGA or RSA Signature options.
<xref target="compatibility"/> discusses in which cases an NDP message has to be
secured in a scenario including non-SEND nodes.</t>

<t>The input of this process is a message obtained in either of the
following ways:

<list style="letters">
        <t>If the Secure ND Proxy generates synthetic SEND messages for a
proxied address, the message MUST be constructed as described in the Neighbor
Discovery for IP version 6 specification <xref target="RFC4861" />.</t>

        <t>If the Secure ND Proxy translates secured messages, first the
authenticity of the intercepted message MUST be verified. If the intercepted
message is a SEND message, it MUST be validated as specified in Section 5 of
the SEND specification <xref target="RFC3971" />. If the intercepted message
contains a PS option, the authenticity of the message MUST be verified as
detailed in <xref target="receiver_rules"/> of this specification. After
validation, the CGA, RSA, or PS options of the original message MUST be
removed. Then, the message to be translated MUST be processed according to the
ND Proxy specification <xref target="RFC4389" />. In this way, it is determined
whether the message received should be proxied or not; the proxy interface
status is updated if needed, the outgoing interface is determined, the
link-layer header and the link-layer address within the payload are modified if
required, etc.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>A Secure ND Proxy then modifies the input message as follows:

<list style="numbers">

        <t>Timestamp and Nonce options MUST be included according to the rules
specified in <xref target="RFC3971"> SEND</xref>. The value in the Timestamp
option MUST be generated by the proxy. If the proxy is translating a message
that includes a nonce, the Nonce value in the proxied message MUST be the same
as in the intercepted message. If the proxy is synthesizing a solicitation
message, the Nonce value MUST be generated by the proxy. If the proxy is
synthesizing an advertisement message, the Nonce value MUST correspond to the
solicitation message to which the proxy is responding.</t>

        <t>
        The Proxy Signature option MUST be added as the last option in the
         message.</t>

        <t>
        The data MUST be signed as explained in <xref target="PSO_section"/>.
        </t>
        
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Processing Rules for Receivers" anchor="receiver_rules">

<t>
Any SEND message without a Proxy Signature option MUST be treated as
specified in the <xref target="RFC3971">SEND specification</xref>.</t>

<t>A SEND message including a Proxy Signature option MUST be processed as specified below:
</t>

<t>
<list style="numbers">

        <t>
        The receiver MUST ignore any RSA and CGA options, as well as any
        options that might come after the first PS option. The options are ignored
        for both signature verification and NDP processing purposes.
        </t>
        
        <t>The Key Hash field MUST indicate the use of a known public key.  A
        valid certification path (see <xref target="RFC6494"/> Section&nbsp;9)
        between the receiver's trust anchor and the sender's public key MUST be
        known.  The Secure Proxy ND X.509v3 certificate MUST contain an

<section title="Proxying Link-Local Addresses">
<t>SEND <xref target="RFC3971"/> relies on certificates to
prove that routers are authorized to announce a certain prefix.
However, Neighbor Discovery <xref target="RFC4861"/> states that routers do not
announce the link-local prefix (fe80::/64). Hence, it is not required for a
SEND certificate to hold an X.509 extension for IP addresses that authorizes
the fe80::/64 prefix. However, some Secure Proxy ND scenarios (<xref target="RFC4389"/>, <xref target="RFC5213"/>) impose
providing the proxying function for the link-local
address of a node. When Secure ND Proxy functionality for a link-local
address is required, either a list of link-local addresses, or the fe80::/64 prefix MUST
be explicitly authorized to be proxied in the corresponding certificate.</t>

<section title="Application Scenarios" anchor="scenarios_section">
<t>In this section, we describe three different application scenarios for which
Secure Proxy ND support for SEND can be applied. Note that the particular way
in which Secure Proxy ND support is applied (which ND messages are proxied, in
which direction, how the interaction with non-SEND hosts and RFC 3971 hosts is
handled, etc.) largely depends on the particular scenario considered. In the
first two scenarios presented below, ND messages are synthesized on behalf of
off-link nodes. In the third one, ND messages are translated from the messages
received in other interfaces of the proxy.</t> 

<section title="Scenario 1: Mobile IPv6">
<t>The description of the problems for deploying SEND in this scenario is
presented in <xref target="RFC5909"/>.</t>

<t> The Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) protocol <xref target="RFC6275"/> allows a Mobile
Node (MN)
to move from one link to another while maintaining reachability at a stable
address, the so-called MN's Home Address (HoA).  When an MN attaches
to a foreign network, all the packets sent to the MN's HoA by a Correspondent
Node (CN) on the home link or a router are intercepted by the Home Agent (HA)
on that home link, encapsulated, and tunneled to the MN's registered
Care-of Address (CoA).</t>

<t>To deploy Secure Proxy ND in this scenario, i.e., to secure the HA operation,
a
Secure Proxy ND certificate with a KeyPurposeId value of id-kp-sendProxiedOwner
for the prefix of the home link is required. The Secure ND Proxy is configured
with the private key associated to this certificate.  
When a NS is intercepted by the HA on the home link, the HA checks whether the
Target Address within the NS
matches with any of the MN's Home Addresses in the binding cache, and if so, it
replies with a Neighbor Advertisement (NA) constructed as described in <xref
target="RFC4861"/>, containing its own link-layer address (HA_LL) as the Target
Link-Layer Address Option (TLLAO). Then, a timestamp (generated by the proxy)
and nonce (if appropriate, according to <xref target="RFC3971"/>) MUST be
included. Finally, a PS option signing the message MUST be included as the last
option of the message.</t>

<section title="Scenario 2: Proxy Mobile IPv6">
<t>

Proxy Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC5213"/> is a network-based
mobility management protocol that provides IP mobility management support
for MNs without requiring that MNs be involved in the mobility-related
signaling.
The IP mobility management is totally hidden to the MN in a Proxy Mobile IPv6
domain, and it is performed by two functional entities: the Local Mobility Anchor
(LMA) and the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG).</t>

<t>When the MN connects to a new access link, it sends a multicast
Router Solicitation (RS). The MAG on the new access link, upon detecting the
MN's attachment, signals the LMA requesting an update of the binding state of the MN
(by means of a Proxy Binding Update (PBU)). Once the signaling is completed (it
receives a Proxy Binding Ack (PBA)), the MAG replies to the MN with a Router
Advertisement (RA) containing the home network prefix(es) that were assigned to
that mobility session, making the MN believe it is still on the same link, so the IPv6 address reconfiguration procedure is not triggered (<xref

<t>To avoid potential link-local address collisions between the MAG and the MN
after a handoff to a new link, the Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification 
<xref target="RFC5213"/> requires that the
MAG's link-local address on the link to which the MN is attached
be generated by the LMA when the MN first attaches to a PMIPv6 domain, and
be provided to the new MN's serving MAG after each handoff. Thus, from the
MN's point of view, the MAG's link-local address remains constant for the
duration of that MN's session.</t>

<t>The approach described above and the current SEND specification are
incompatible,
since sharing the same link-local address on different MAGs would require
all MAGs of a PMIPv6 domain to construct the CGA and the RSA Signature
option with the same public-private key pair, which is not an acceptable security policy.</t> 

<t> Using different public-private key pairs on different MAGs would mean that
different MAGs use different CGAs as link-local addresses. Thus, the
serving MAG's
link-local address would change after each handoff of the MN, which is in contradiction
with the way MAG link-local address assignment occurs in a PMIPv6 domain.
</t>

<t>To provide SEND protection, each MAG MUST be configured to act as a proxy by
means of a certificate associated to the PMIPv6 domain, authorizing each MAG to
securely proxy NA and RS messages by means of a KeyPurposeId value of
id-kp-sendProxiedOwner.  In
addition, the certificate MUST also authorize the MAG to advertise prefixes by
associating to the same certificate a KeyPurposeId value of
id&nbhy;kp&nbhy;sendProxiedRouter. Note that the inclusion of multiple
KeyPurposeId values is supported by <xref target="RFC6494"/>.</t>

<t>When a MAG replies to an RS with an RA, the source address MUST be equal to
the MAG link-local address associated to the MN in this PMIPv6 domain, with its
own link-layer address as the source link-layer address. 
Then, a timestamp
(generated by the proxy) and nonce (if appropriate, according to <xref
target="RFC3971"/>) MUST be included. Finally, a PS option signing the message
MUST be included as the last option of the message. This procedure is followed
for any other ND message that could be generated by the MAG to the MN.</t>

<t>A node receiving a message from the MAG containing the PS option MUST apply
the processing rules defined in <xref target="receiver_rules"/>. 
Note that unsolicited messages sent by the MAG should be validated by the host
according to timestamp values specific to the MAG serving the link, not to any
other MAG to which the host has been connected before in other links, according
to processing step number 6 of <xref target="receiver_rules"/>.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC4389">The Neighbor Discovery (ND) Proxy specification </xref>
provides a method by which multiple link-layer segments are bridged into a
single segment and specifies the IP-layer support that enables bridging under
these circumstances.</t>

<t>A Secure ND Proxy MUST parse any IPv6 packet it receives on a proxy interface
to check whether it contains one of the following NDP messages: NS, NA,
RS, RA, or Redirect. The Secure ND Proxy MUST verify the authenticity of the
received ND message, according to <xref target="RFC3971"/>, or according to
<xref target="receiver_rules"/> if it contains a PS option. Then, after
removing the CGA, RSA, or PS options, the message to be translated MUST be
processed according to the ND Proxy specification <xref target="RFC4389"
/>. This includes performing loop prevention checks, determining the outgoing
interface for the proxied message, changing the source link-layer address to
the address of the outgoing interface, changing source link-layer addresses
contained in the payload (that is, in a Source Link-Layer Address Option
(SLLAO) or a Target Link-Layer Address Option (TLLAO)), maintaining the
destination link-layer address as the address in the neighbor entry
corresponding to the destination IPv6 address, setting the P bit for proxied RA
messages, etc. Note that besides link-layer addresses and the P bit of a RA, no
other field of the received message is changed when proxied by an <xref
target="RFC4389" /> proxy.</t>

<t>When any other IPv6 unicast packet is received on a proxy interface,
if it is not locally destined, then it is forwarded unchanged (other than using
a new link-layer header) to the proxy interface for which the next-hop address
appears in the neighbor cache. If no neighbor cache entry is present, the
Secure ND
Proxy SHOULD queue the packet and initiate a Neighbor Discovery signaling as
if the NS message were locally generated. </t>

<t>Note that to be able to sign any NS, NA, RS, RA, or Redirect message,
the key used MUST correspond to a certificate with KeyPurposeId values of
id-kp-sendProxiedOwner and id-kp-sendProxiedRouter.</t>

<t>In order to deploy this scenario, nodes in proxied segments MUST know the
certificate-authorizing proxy operation. To do so, it could be required that
at least one device per proxied segment (maybe the proxy itself)
be configured to propagate the required certification path to authorize
proxy operation by means of a CPS/CPA exchange.</t>

<t>RFC 3971 nodes, i.e., SEND nodes not compliant with the modifications
required
in <xref target="specification_section" />, cannot correctly interpret a PS
option received in a proxied ND message. These SEND nodes silently discard the
PS option, as specified in <xref target="RFC4861"/> for any unknown option. As
a result, these messages will be treated as unsecured, as described in
Section 8 ("Transitions Issues") of the <xref target="RFC3971">SEND
specification</xref>.</t>

<t>When RFC 3971 nodes and SPND nodes exchange ND messages (without proxy
intervention), in either direction, messages are generated according to the
<xref target="RFC3971">SEND specification</xref>, so these nodes interoperate
seamlessly.</t>

<t>In the scenarios in which the proxy translates ND messages, the messages to
translate can either be originated in an RFC 3971 node or in a SPND node,
without interoperability issues (note that the difference between RFC 3971
nodes and SPND nodes only affects the ability to process received NDP
messages containing a PS option, not the way they generate messages secured
by SEND).</t>

<t>A configuration option MAY exist in a Secure ND Proxy to specify the
RFC 3971
nodes to which it is connected, so that the proxied messages sent to these
nodes are not processed according to the Secure Proxy ND specification, for
performance reasons.</t>
 
</section>

<section title="Backward Compatibility with Non-SEND Nodes">
<t>Non-SEND nodes receiving NDP packets silently discard PS options, as
specified in <xref target="RFC4861"/> for any unknown option. Therefore, these
nodes interpret messages proxied by a Secure ND Proxy as any other ND
message.</t>

<t>When non-SEND nodes and SPND nodes exchange ND messages (without proxy
intervention), in either direction, the rules specified in Section 8 of <xref
target="RFC3971"/> apply.</t> 

<t>A Secure ND Proxy SHOULD support the use of secured and unsecured NDP
messages at the same time, although it MAY have a configuration that causes
proxying to not be performed for unsecured NDP messages. A Secure ND Proxy
MAY also have
a configuration option whereby it disables secure ND proxying completely. This
configuration SHOULD be switched off by default; that is, security is provided
by default. In the following paragraphs, we discuss the recommended
behavior of the
Secure ND Proxy regarding the protection level to provide to proxied
messages in a mixed scenario involving SPND/RFC 3971 nodes and non-SEND
nodes. In particular, two different situations occur, depending on whether
the proxied nodes are RFC 3971 or SPND nodes, or non-SEND nodes.</t>

<t>As a rule of thumb, if the proxied nodes can return to the link in
which the proxy operates, the Secure ND Proxy MUST only generate PS
options on behalf of nodes with SEND capabilities (i.e., those nodes
that could use SEND to defend their messages if present on the same
link as the proxy -- in other words, either RFC 3971 nodes or SPND
nodes). This is relevant to allow nodes to prefer secured
information over an unsecured one, and to properly execute the
Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) procedure, as
specified in <xref target="RFC3971"/>. Therefore, in this case, the Secure ND
Proxy MUST synthesize/translate messages containing the PS option for SPND and
RFC 3971 hosts, and MUST NOT synthesize/translate messages
containing the PS option for non-SEND nodes. Note that ND advertisements in
response to solicitations generated by a Secure ND Proxy must either be
secured or not secured,
according to the previous considerations (i.e., according to the nature
of the proxied
node), and not according to the secure or unsecure nature of the solicitation
message.</t>

<t>In order to apply this rule, the Secure ND Proxy needs to know the security
capabilities of the proxied node. The way this information is acquired depends
on the application scenario, and it is discussed next: 

<list style="symbols">
<t>For scenarios in which ND messages are translated for nodes that can arrive
to the link in which the proxy operates, the rule can be easily applied: only
for messages validated in the Secure ND Proxy according to the <xref
target="RFC3971">SEND specification</xref>, or according to <xref
target="receiver_rules"/> of this specification for messages containing a PS
option (which means that another proxy previously checked that the original
message was secured), the message MUST be proxied securely by
the inclusion of a PS option. Unsecured ND messages could be proxied if
unsecured operation is enabled in the proxy, but the message generated by the
Secure ND Proxy for the received message MUST NOT include a PS option.</t> 

<t>For scenarios in which ND messages are synthesized on behalf of remote
nodes, different considerations should be made according to the particular
application scenario.

        <list style="symbols">
        <t>For MIPv6, if the MN can return to the home link, it is required
that the proxy know whether the node could use SEND to defend its address
or not. A HA
including the PS option for proxying a non-SEND MN would make ND messages sent
by the proxy be more preferred than an ND message of the non-SEND MN when
the
MN returns to the home link (even if the proxied messages have the Override bit
set to 1). Not using the PS option for an RFC 3971 or SPND MN would make the
address in the home link more vulnerable when the MN is away than when it is in
the home link, defeating the purpose of the Secure Proxy ND
mechanism. Therefore, in this case, the HA MUST know the SEND capabilities of
the MN, MUST use the PS option if the MN is a SPND or RFC&nbsp;3971 host,
and MUST NOT use the PS option for non-SEND hosts.</t> 

        <t>For the Proxy Mobile IPv6 scenario, a node moving from a link in
which the PS option has been used to protect a link-layer address to a link in
which ND messages are not protected by SEND would prevent the MN from acquiring
the new information until the cached information expires. However, in this
case, it is reasonable to consider that all MAGs provide the same security for
protecting ND messages, and that either all MAGs or no MAGs will behave as a
Secure ND Proxy, so configuration is expected to be easier. </t>
        </list>
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>A configuration option MAY exist in a Secure ND Proxy to specify the
non-SEND nodes to which it is connected, so that the  proxied messages sent to
these nodes are not processed according to the Secure Proxy ND specification,
for performance reasons.</t>

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>The mechanism described in this document introduces a new
PS option allowing a Secure ND Proxy to synthesize or translate a SEND
message for a proxied address, to redirect traffic for given target addresses,
or to advertise prefix information by means of RA messages. A SPND
node only accepts such a message if it includes a valid PS option 
generated by a properly authorized Secure ND Proxy (with a certificate
containing a KeyPurposeId with value id&nbhy;kp&nbhy;sendProxiedOwner
for protecting NA,
NS, and RS messages, or containing a KeyPurposeId value of
id-kp-sendProxiedRouter for protecting RA and Redirect messages). Such a
message has protection against the threats presented in Section 9 of
<xref target="RFC3971"/> equivalent to a message signed with an RSA Signature
option.</t>

<t>The security of proxied ND messages not including a PS option is the same as
an unsecured ND message. The security of a proxied ND message received by a
non-SEND host or RFC 3971 host is the same as an unsecured ND message.</t>

<t>When a message including a PS option is received by a SPND node, any CGA or
RSA options also included in the message are removed and the remaining message
further processed. Although properly formed proxied messages MUST NOT include
PS and CGA/RSA options at the same time, discarding them if they appear does
not affect security. If the PS option is validated, then the information
included in the message has been validly generated by a proxy, and should be
honored (remember that anti-replay protection is provided by means of Nonce and
Timestamp options). If the PS option is not validated, then it is treated as an
unsecured message. In any case, there is no gain for an attacker from appending
false or old CGA/RSA information to a message secured by a Secure ND Proxy.</t>

<t>A compromised Secure ND Proxy provisioned with an authorization certificate
with a KeyPurposeId value of id-kp-sendProxiedRouter is able, like a
compromised router, to siphon off traffic from the host, or mount a
man-in-the-middle attack, for hosts communicating to off-link hosts. A
compromised Secure ND Proxy provisioned with an authorization certificate with
a KeyPurposeId value of id&nbhy;kp&nbhy;sendProxiedOwner can siphon off
traffic or mount
a man-in-the-middle attack for communication between on-link hosts, even if the
hosts use SEND. Note that different application scenarios may require one type
of authorization, the other, or both. To minimize security risks, authorization
capabilities MUST NOT exceed the ones strictly required by the application
scenario to be deployed.
</t>
   
<t>The messages for which a Secure ND Proxy performs its function and the link
for which this function is performed MUST be configured appropriately for each
proxy and scenario. This configuration is especially relevant if
Secure Proxy ND is used for translating ND messages from one link to
another.</t>

<t><xref target="compatibility"/> discusses the security considerations
resulting from the decision to append or omit the PS option,
depending on the SEND-awareness of the proxied nodes.</t>

<t>Protection against replay attacks from unsolicited messages such as NA, RA,
and Redirects is provided by means of the Timestamp option. When Secure ND
Proxy is used, each host, and each proxy acting on behalf of that host, are
considered to be different peers in terms of timestamp verification. Since the
information provided by the host and a proxy, including different link-layer
addresses, may be different, a replay attack could affect the operation of a
third node: replaying messages issued by a host that is no longer in the link
can prevent the use of a proxy, and replaying messages of a proxy when the host
is back in the link can prevent communication with the host. This kind of
attack can be performed until the timestamp of the peer (either the host or a
proxy) is no longer valid for the receiver. The window of vulnerability is in
general larger for the first message received from a new peer than for
subsequent messages received from the same peer (see <xref
target="RFC3971"/>). A more detailed analysis of the possible attacks related
to the Timestamp option is described in Section 6.3 of <xref
target="RFC5909"/>.</t>
