        This document defines procedures for how a SIP User Agent should
        locate, retrieve, and maintain current configuration information

  <section anchor='introduction' title="Introduction">

    <t>
      A user gets a new SIP User Agent (UA); it may be a hardware device or software.  Some
      User Agents have a user interface that can accept a username, password, and domain
      name.  Other devices, like Analog Telephony Adapters (ATAs), have no user interface other
      than that provided by an attached analog phone.  How does a
      non-technical user minimally configure it so that when it is started, something
      useful happens?
    </t>

    <section anchor='scope' title="Scope">

      <t>
        This document specifies a procedure for how a
        SIP User Agent locates, retrieves, and maintains current configuration information
        for a given SIP Service Provider.  As such, it specifies requirements to be met by both
        the User Agent, the Configuration Service at the SIP Service Provider, and the network
        infrastructure services that allow them to communicate.
      </t>

      <t>
          Nothing in this specification prohibits a User Agent from obtaining configuration
          information by any means in addition to the mechanisms specified herein.  
      </t>

      <t>
        The intent of this specification is to provide mechanisms sufficient for User Agents
        to discover an appropriate source of configuration and maintain the currency of that
        configuration.  A User Agent implementation compliant with this specification MAY
        also implement additional mechanisms necessary in particular environments
        or when the services specified here are not available.
      </t>

      <t>
        The form and content of configuration data to be downloaded are outside the scope of
        this specification, although <xref target='configuration.data.items'/>, "<xref target='configuration.data.items' format='title'/>" suggests a
        minimum set of data items likely to be required by all types of UAs.

    <section anchor='terminology' title="Terminology">
        <t>
          The following terms are used in this document:

      <list style='hanging'>
        <t hangText='User Agent, UA'/>
        <t>
              As defined in <xref target='RFC3261'>RFC 3261</xref>. Note that this includes any implementation of a User
              Agent. A SIP phone is a User Agent, but the term also encompasses any other
              entity that uses SIP (for example, for a text chat, for sharing a whiteboard, or
              for a fax). 
        </t>
        <t hangText='Soft User Agent, Soft UA'/>
        <t>
              A User Agent that runs as an application within some larger system that has
              responsibility for some of the steps described in this specification.  In those
              cases, the Soft UA must be able to obtain the information from the platform.  In
              all cases, the term User Agent also encompasses a Soft User Agent.
        </t>

        <t hangText='SIP Service Provider, Service Provider'/>
        <t>
              An entity that provides services to User Agents using the SIP protocol.  This
              specification requires that a Service Provider make configuration data and
              certain other information available in order to configure User Agents.
        </t>

        <t hangText='Configuration'/>
        <t>
              The set of information that establishes operational parameters for a particular User Agent.
        </t>

        <t hangText='Configuration Service, CS'/>
        <t>
              The source of Configuration for User Agents.
        </t>

        <t anchor='config.service.domain' hangText='Configuration Service Domain'/>
        <t>
              The DNS name for the service from which a Configuration is requested.

        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
        "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be

    <section anchor='phone.installation.examples' title="User Agent Installation Examples">

      <t>
        This section is non-normative; it is a set of "user stories" -- narrative descriptions of
        the user experience in different environments.  These are "black box" descriptions
        meant to include the actions to be taken by the human participants (including
        administrators and system operators as well as the "user" of the UA), but not how the
        network elements communicate or operate internally.  The intent is that these narratives
        provide context for the subsequent technical specifications.
      </t>

      <section anchor='example.hosted.ip.service.provider' title="Hosted IP Service Provider Example">

        <t>
          Configuring a new UA to use a hosted IP telephony service will
          typically proceed as follows:  the customer makes a request to their
          Service Provider to add one or more new users to their service.  The
          customer may supply further details such as a preferred username, type
          of endpoint and any requests for specific functionality, depending on
          what information the Service Provider considers useful, but no
          additional information is required from the customer.
        </t>
        <t>
          The Service Provider performs any necessary provisioning actions on their equipment,
          and returns to the customer provisioning information, which may include a domain
          name or a numeric domain identifier for the provider, a user identifier, and a
          password.  Typically, a Service Provider will supply provisioning information for
          each device to be provisioned, but may choose to supply information that can be used
          with multiple devices, or for a limited duration or with other benefits and
          restrictions.
        </t>
        <t>
          The customer enters the provisioning information into the
          UA to be configured, whereupon the UA uses this information to locate
          the configuration service, securely fetch the configuration information,
          and configure itself for operation.
        </t>

      </section>

      <section anchor='example.ip-pbx.solution' title="IP-PBX Example">
        <t>
          Configuring a new UA in a typical business begins by provisioning a user identity in
          the Private Branch Exchange (PBX) (add user "John Smith"), and assigning a phone number to the user.  That
          number must then be assigned to a line on a specific UA; this is usually done by
          selecting a UA and provisioning it in the PBX by its serial number (usually a Media Access Control (MAC)
          address), and then assigning the identity or phone number to a 'line' on that UA in the
          PBX configuration system.
        </t>

        <t>
          Once provisioning in the PBX is complete, the new user goes to his or her workplace
          and connects the UA to the network.  When connected and powered up, the UA is
          provided with the user identity, phone number, and any other configuration data with
          no local user interaction -- just connecting it to the network loads the configuration
          from the PBX and the UA is operational.
        </t>

      </section>

      <section anchor='high.security' title="Special Considerations for High Security Deployments">
        <t>
          To deploy a new UA in a high security scenario requires some special consideration. A
          security-conscious deployment will most likely require that the SIP and other
          management interfaces, including the interface to the configuration service, be
          secured before the device is put into service.
        </t>
        <t>
          In order to achieve any level of security, the device will need to be
          pre-configured with some security-related information in the form of
          certificates. This may be achieved in a number of ways. Some examples include:

        <list style='numbers'>
            <t>
              An administrator who configures the device in a secure environment before making
              the device available to the user.
            </t>

            <t>
              Some certificates may be built into the device during the manufacturing process
              enabling the configuration service to certify information such as the manufacturer,
              UA type, and MAC address. The configuration service may then be used to provision
              the device with other certificates as required.
            </t>

            <t>
              The device may have a facility for the user to provide the security information
              in the form of a security card or dongle.
            </t>

        </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          All these mechanism are likely to restrict the user to a limited set of devices
          approved for use in a particular deployment.
        </t>
      </section>

    </section>
  </section>

  <section anchor='auto.config' title="Obtaining User Agent Configuration">

    <t>
      This section specifies how a User Agent connects to the network, determines for which domain
      to request configuration, obtains configuration from that domain, and is notified by
      that domain when the configuration changes.  
    </t>

    <t>
      The User Agent MAY obtain configuration information by any means in addition to those
      specified here, and MAY use such information in preference to any of the steps specified
      below, but MUST be capable of using these procedures alone in order to be compliant with
      this specification.
    </t>

    <section anchor='network.discovery' title="Network Discovery">

      <t>
        A UA needs a minimum set of parameters to allow it to communicate on the network. Some
        networks allow the UA to automatically discover these parameters, while other networks
        require some or all of these parameters to be manually provisioned on the UA.
      </t>

      <section anchor='link.discovery.auto' title="Link Layer Provisioning">

        <t>
          The UA SHOULD attempt to use Link Layer Discovery Protocol -
          Media Endpoint Discovery (LLDP-MED; see <xref target='ANSI.TIA-1057-2006'/>) for
          automatic provisioning of link layer parameters.
        </t>

        <t>
          In some deployments, failure to properly provision the link layer may result in the
          UA having incorrect Layer 2 priority, degrading the quality of service, or being on
          the wrong virtual LAN (VLAN), possibly resulting in complete loss of service.

                defined, the UA MUST attempt to obtain the IP Network Parameters using

        To obtain a configuration, the UA needs to know what domain to request it from.  This
        domain is the Configuration Service Domain; its value is a DNS name (see <xref

      </t>

      <t>
        User control or prior configuration MAY establish a value for the Configuration
        Service Domain that takes precedence over the discovery procedure defined below.
        In the absence of user control or prior configuration, candidate
        values for the Configuration Service Domain
        are obtained as specified in <xref target='domain.discovery.localnet'/>, "<xref target='domain.discovery.localnet' format='title'/>", or if that is

          NAPTR records for that domain name.  From the returned records, the UA MUST select
          those whose Service field value is "SFUA.CFG"; from those

        <t>
          The NAPTR records for the Configuration Service Domain name whose Service field

        <t>
          Note that the UA does not need to implement a general regular expression evaluator in

          stripping the fixed value "!^.*!" from the beginning of the value,
          and "!" from the end of the value to obtain the base URL.  See

            Multiple Configuration Servers can be used to provide redundancy and additional

        To request configuration using a URL constructed as specified in
        <xref target='configservice.url'/>, "<xref target='configservice.url'
        format='title'/>" the User Agent MUST do an HTTPS GET request to
        each of the URLs until a configuration that the UA can use is
        returned in response to one of the requests.
      </t>

      <t>
        A successful final response from the Configuration Service to a GET request for
        configuration data MUST contain configuration data for the UA in the HTTP response
        body.  Note that the full capabilities of HTTP as specified in
        <xref target='RFC2616'></xref> are available to the CS, so responses
        such as redirection can be used by the CS as a part of the process of providing 
        configuration data.
      </t>

      <t>
        Configuration data returned in a successful response is subject to change by the CS.
        The HTTP cache control metadata (the max-age directive value from any Cache-Control
        header, and the Etag and Last-Modified header values) returned in the response that
        provides configuration data is used to determine when a configuration change has
        occurred (<xref target='change.notification'/>, "<xref target='change.notification'

            <t>
              An HTTP response from the CS that provides configuration data MUST include cache
              control metadata sufficient to ensure that when a new configuration is available,
              the cache control information for that new data is different.
            </t>

            <t>
              The UA MUST retain all of the HTTP cache control metadata from any response that
              provides configuration data.

      <section anchor='request.http.authentication' title="Configuration Data Request Authentication">

        <t>
          Since the Configuration Request URL scheme is HTTPS, the UA
          MUST always use Transport Layer Security  (TLS) <xref target='RFC5246'></xref>
          to establish a connection with the Configuration Service.  
        </t>

        <t>
          The UA MUST provide a server_name extension in the TLS Client Hello message as
          defined in <xref target='RFC4366'></xref> "Transport Layer Security
(TLS) Extensions", whose value is the Configuration Service Domain name (note that
          this might not be the same as the host part of the CS base URL). This allows the
          CS to identify and provide a server certificate containing the
          desired identity (allowing for a single server to serve multiple domain
          names).   
        </t>

        <t>
          A UA MUST attempt to validate the server certificate provided by
          the CS, in accordance with the rules defined in Section 3.1 of
           <xref target='RFC2818'></xref>.  Unfortunately, the validation attempt might fail (e.g.,
          because the UA might not have in firmware a trusted root CA cert to
          which the CS certificate chain can be connected or because the root
          CA cert has expired since the UA firmware was last updated).  If the
          UA is unable to validate the server certificate provided by the CS,
          the UA SHOULD store the server certificate and alert the user if
          that CS host provides a different certificate in the future.
          Although this 'trust on first use' model is not as secure as
          certificate validation, it does give some protection against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks in the future.
        </t>

        <t>
          If it has one, the UA MUST provide a client certificate.  The CS MUST validate the
          UA client's certificate, if one is provided.  If the CS is unable to authenticate the
          certificate provided by the UA (for example, the UA is using a self-signed
          certificate), then the CS MAY choose to cache the certificate, provided that the UA
          successfully authenticates using HTTP authentication (see next paragraph).
          This allows a CS to treat the digest authentication credentials as a single-use
          password to authenticate the client certificate.  This 'trust on first use' model
          provides protection against future MITM attacks, provided that the
          initial communication is not compromised.
        </t>

        <t>
          If the CS requires HTTP authentication of the configuration data
          request, the HTTP 'username' parameter used MUST be the same
          value as the sfua-user value provided in the configuration data
          request parameters.  The UA MUST implement both Basic and
          Digest authentication as specified by <xref target='RFC2617'></xref>.

            When a NOTIFY message is received by the UA in the configuration change subscription,

      <t>        
        The UA MAY use configuration data that is of unknown validity, or configuration data
        that is known to be no longer valid, while attempting to revalidate that data or
        obtain new data.  There is no assurance that such configuration data is still

          To revalidate stored configuration data of unknown validity, the UA MUST repeat the

          appropriate HTTP headers to make the request a conditional request using the cache
          control data returned in the response that provided the configuration data.  This allows the CS
          to respond either with a new configuration data response or a 304 (Not Modified)
          response to indicate that the configuration data has not changed.

        <t>
          If the CS responds with a 304 response, and the original response included a Link
          header with the 'monitor' relation, the SIP UA MUST assume that the value of that
          Link header is also still correct (in effect, the HTTP cache control values and the
          subscription URL are a part of the configuration data), and so the UA MUST attempt to
          create and maintain a subscription to that URL as when the configuration data was
          first obtained (<xref target='change.subscription'/>, "<xref

          value as the maximum validity time for the associated configuration data.
        </t>

        <t>
          If the HTTP request to revalidate the configuration fails, the UA MUST follow the

      <t>
        In case of certain possible failures as described above, the appropriate response is to

        <list style='symbols'>
          
            <t>
              The UA SHOULD retry at least 5 times before abandoning the failed step (except as

            <t>
              Following the first instance of a given failure, the UA MUST select an initial
              backoff timer value randomly between 2 and 8, inclusive, and wait this number of
              seconds before retrying the failed request.
            </t>
          
          
            <t>
              Following any subsequent instance of a given failure, the UA MUST increase the
              backoff timer value by 2 raised to the power of the number of preceding failures
              (2^N where N is the number of previous failures), and
              wait this increased number of seconds or the maximum interval specified by
              specific error handling procedures, whichever is less, before retrying the failed
              request.
            </t>
          
        </list>
        For example, after an initial failure, the UA randomly chooses an initial backoff timer value of
        4 seconds, followed by retries at the following times: 
        6 seconds (4 + 2^1), 
        10 seconds (6 + 2^2), 
        18 seconds (10 + 2^3),

      <t>
        In the above diagram, Searchstring is a string specifying the
        searchlist.  If the length of the searchlist exceeds the maximum
        permissible within a single option (255 octets), then multiple
        options MAY be used, as described in <xref target='RFC3396'></xref> "Encoding Long DHCP Options in the Dynamic Host
        Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4)".
      </t>

      <t>
        To enable the searchlist to be encoded compactly, searchstrings in
        the searchlist MUST be concatenated and encoded using the technique
        described in Section 4.1.4 of <xref target='RFC1035'></xref>, "Domain Names - Implementation and
        Specification".  In this scheme, an entire domain name or a
        list of labels at the end of a domain name is replaced with a pointer
        to a prior occurrence of the same name.  Despite its complexity, this
        technique is valuable since the space available for encoding DHCP
        options is limited, and it is likely that a domain searchstring will
        contain repeated instances of the same domain name.  Thus, the DNS
        name compression is both useful and likely to be effective.
      </t>

      <t>
        For use in this specification, the pointer refers to the offset
        within the data portion of the DHCP option (not including the
        preceding DHCP option code byte or DHCP option length byte).
      </t>

      <t>
        If multiple SIP UA Configuration Service Domains options are present, then the data portions
        of all the SIP UA Configuration Service Domains options are concatenated together as
        specified in RFC 3396, and the pointer indicates
        an offset within the complete aggregate block of data.
      </t>

      <t>
        For examples of encoding this option, see Section 3 of <xref
        target='RFC3397'></xref>, "Dynamic Host Configuration
        Protocol (DHCP) Domain Search Option", which uses the same encoding

  <section title='Security Considerations'>

    <t>
      Initial discovery of the Configuration Service Domain name relies on a number of
      operations that are normally unsecured: a DHCP response could be provided by an
      attacker to replace the values of any of the IP Network Parameters (<xref
      target='network.discovery.auto'/>, "<xref target='network.discovery.auto'
      format='title'/>") including the Local Network Domain which is the default choice
      for the Configuration Service Domain name.  Confirmation by the human
      user of the Configuration Service Domain name, especially when it differs from a
      previously used value, could be used to mitigate this (perhaps unintentional)
      potential reconfiguration.  Note that previously loaded configuration MAY constrain
      which parts of the discovery and location procedures are used: for example, the
      Configuration Service Domain name might be fixed so that it cannot be modified by
      discovery. 
    </t>
    <t>
      The connection to the Configuration Service is made over TLS.  As the TLS server,
      the CS always provides a server certificate during the TLS handshake; if possible,
      the UA should validate that certificate and confirm that it contains as a subject
      the Configuration Service Domain name or at least the host name from the
      Configuration Service Base URL (see <xref target='RFC2818'></xref>).  While it may not be possible to have the
      information needed to perform a full validation of the CS server certificate prior
      to the first configuration (for example, the UA may not have a current CA
      certificate for the CA that signs the CS server certificate), implementors are
      advised to provide that information in configuration data so that it
      can be used for subsequent reconfigurations; this narrows the window of
      vulnerability to the first configuration attempt.   
    </t>
    <t>
      To secure initial configuration attempts, the CS can deny requests from unknown
      devices and/or could implement other measures such as restricting the time window
      during which it will accept an initial configuration request from a given device. A
      more secure approach would be to provide the user with a password, perhaps a
      one-time password valid only for the initial access.  In high security environments,
      the Configuration Service could require that the User Agent provide a client
      certificate for authentication in the TLS connection for configuration data
      requests.  This would necessitate some prior manual configuration of the User Agent,
      and possibly the Configuration Service, and that configuration should also include
      sufficient information for the UA to fully validate the CS certificate.
    </t>
    <t>
      The values of some or all of the request parameters sent by the UA on the initial
      request for configuration data (see <xref target='configservice.url.addparams'/>,
      "<xref target='configservice.url.addparams' format='title'/>") may be sensitive
      information.  Since the configuration data request is made over a TLS connection,
      the confidentiality of that information is protected on the network.
      Configuration Service implementations should take all necessary measures to
      ensure that the request parameter data is appropriately protected within the CS
      itself. 
    </t>
    <t>
      The Configuration Change Request Subscription (<xref
      target='change.subscription'/>, "<xref target='change.subscription'
      format='title'/>") is established only after the configuration data has been loaded
      by the User Agent, so all security mechanisms available in SIP (including request
      digest authentication and the use of TLS) can be configured and required by either
      the CS or the UA.  Note that a configuration change notice does not actually provide
      any new configuration data, nor can it change where the UA sends a request for the
      new configuration data.  This means that an attacker cannot reconfigure a UA by
      subverting only the change notice subscription; the most the attacker can do is
      trigger checks for new data.  In order to actually modify the configuration data
      itself, the attacker must subvert the CS or the steps leading to the CS discovery
      (subject to the checks described above).
    </t>

    <t>
      Implementations of TLS typically support multiple versions of the
      Transport Layer Security protocol as well as the older Secure Sockets
      Layer (SSL) protocol.  Because of known security vulnerabilities, SIP
      UAs, SIP Service Provider, and the Configuration Service Host MUST
      NOT request, offer, or use SSL 2.0. See Appendix E.2 of <xref
      target='RFC5246'></xref> for further details.

<t>
   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a framework
   for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCPIP network.
   DHCP is based on the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) , adding the
   capability of automatic allocation of reusable network addresses and
   additional configuration options .  DHCP captures the behavior of
   BOOTP relay agents [7, 21], and DHCP participants can interoperate
   with BOOTP participants .

<t>
   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
   protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
   systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for
   many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and
   distributed object management systems, through extension of its
   request methods, error codes and headers . A feature of HTTP is
   the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems
   to be built independently of the data being transferred.
</t>
<t>

   HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information
   initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol
   referred to as "HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068 .

<abstract>
<t>
   "HTTP/1.0", includes the specification for a Basic Access
   Authentication scheme. This scheme is not considered to be a secure
   method of user authentication (unless used in conjunction with some
   external secure system such as SSL ), as the user name and
   password are passed over the network as cleartext.
      </t>
<t>
   This document also provides the specification for HTTP's
   authentication framework, the original Basic authentication scheme
   and a scheme based on cryptographic hashes, referred to as "Digest
   Access Authentication".  It is therefore also intended to serve as a
   replacement for RFC 2069 .  Some optional elements specified by
   RFC 2069 have been removed from this specification due to problems
   found since its publication; other new elements have been added for
   compatibility, those new elements have been made optional, but are
   strongly recommended.
      </t>

<t>
   Like Basic, Digest access authentication verifies that both parties
   to a communication know a shared secret (a password); unlike Basic,
   this verification can be done without sending the password in the
   clear, which is Basic's biggest weakness. As with most other
   authentication protocols, the greatest sources of risks are usually
   found not in the core protocol itself but in policies and procedures
   surrounding its use.

<t>
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification
defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI
reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative
grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual
specifications of each URI scheme.

<abstract>
<t>Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).&lt;/t>&lt;t> In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This document obsoletes RFC 2434. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows proxy servers to initiate TCP connections or to send asynchronous UDP datagrams to User Agents in order to deliver requests.  However, in a large number of real deployments, many practical considerations, such as the existence of firewalls and Network Address Translators (NATs) or the use of TLS with server-provided certificates, prevent servers from connecting to User Agents in this way.  This specification defines behaviors for User Agents, registrars, and proxy servers that allow requests to be delivered on existing connections established by the User Agent.  It also defines keep-alive behaviors needed to keep NAT bindings open and specifies the usage of multiple connections from the User Agent to its registrar. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

          <abstract>
            <t>
              The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is increasingly being
              used in systems that are tightly coupled with Hypertext
              Transport Protocol (HTTP) servers for a variety of
              reasons. In many of these cases, applications
              can benefit from being able to discover, in near-real-time,
              when a specific HTTP resource is created, changed, or
              deleted. This document proposes a mechanism, based on
              the SIP events framework, for doing so.
