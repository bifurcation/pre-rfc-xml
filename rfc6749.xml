        The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited
        access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval
        interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party
        application to obtain access on its own behalf. This specification replaces and obsoletes
        the OAuth 1.0 protocol described in RFC 5849.

    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>
        In the traditional client-server authentication model, the client
requests an access-restricted resource (protected resource) on the server by
authenticating with the server
        using the resource owner's credentials. In order to provide third-party applications access
        to restricted resources, the resource owner shares its credentials with
the third party.
        This creates several problems and limitations:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            Third-party applications are required to store the resource owner's credentials
            for future use, typically a password in clear-text.
          </t>
          <t>
            Servers are required to support password authentication, despite the security
            weaknesses inherent in passwords.
          </t>
          <t>
            Third-party applications gain overly broad access to the resource owner's protected
            resources, leaving resource owners without any ability to restrict duration or access
            to a limited subset of resources.
          </t>
          <t>
            Resource owners cannot revoke access to an individual third party
without revoking
            access to all third parties, and must do so by changing the
            third party's password.
          </t>
          <t>
            Compromise of any third-party application results in compromise of the end-user's
            password and all of the data protected by that password.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        OAuth addresses these issues by introducing an authorization layer and separating the role
        of the client from that of the resource owner. In OAuth, the client requests access to
        resources controlled by the resource owner and hosted by the resource server, and is issued
        a different set of credentials than those of the resource owner.
      </t>
      <t>
        Instead of using the resource owner's credentials to access protected resources, the client
        obtains an access token -- a string denoting a specific scope, lifetime, and other access
        attributes. Access tokens are issued to third-party clients by an authorization server with
        the approval of the resource owner. The client uses the access token to access the
        protected resources hosted by the resource server.
      </t>
      <t>
        For example, an end-user (resource owner) can grant a printing service (client) access
        to her protected photos stored at a photo-sharing service (resource server), without
        sharing her username and password with the printing service. Instead, she authenticates
        directly with a server trusted by the photo-sharing service (authorization server), which
        issues the printing service delegation-specific credentials (access token).
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification is designed for use with HTTP (<xref target='RFC2616' />). The use of
        OAuth over any protocol other than HTTP is out of scope.
      </t>
      <t>
        The OAuth 1.0 protocol (<xref target='RFC5849' />), published as an informational document,
        was the result of a small ad hoc community effort. This Standards Track specification builds
        on the OAuth 1.0 deployment experience, as well as additional use cases and extensibility
        requirements gathered from the wider IETF community. The OAuth 2.0 protocol is not backward
        compatible with OAuth 1.0. The two versions may co-exist on the
 network, and implementations
        may choose to support both. However, it is the intention of this specification that new
        implementations support OAuth 2.0 as specified in this document and that OAuth 1.0 is used
        only to support existing deployments. The OAuth 2.0 protocol shares very few implementation
        details with the OAuth 1.0 protocol. Implementers familiar with OAuth 1.0 should approach
        this document without any assumptions as to its structure and details.
      </t>

      <section title='Roles'>
        <t>
          OAuth defines four roles:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style='hanging'>
            <t hangText='resource owner'>
              <vspace />
              An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource. When the resource owner
              is a person, it is referred to as an end&nbhy;user.
            </t>
            <t hangText='resource server'>
              <vspace />
              The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to
              protected resource requests using access tokens.
            </t>
            <t hangText='client'>
              <vspace />
              An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and
              with its authorization. The term "client" does not imply any particular implementation
              characteristics (e.g., whether the application executes on a server, a desktop, or
              other devices).
            </t>
            <t hangText='authorization server'>
              <vspace />
              The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the
              resource owner and obtaining authorization.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The interaction between the authorization server and resource server is beyond the scope
          of this specification. The authorization server may be the same server as the resource
          server or a separate entity. A single authorization server may issue access tokens
          accepted by multiple resource servers.

          The abstract OAuth 2.0 flow illustrated in <xref target='Figure-1' /> describes the interaction
          between the four roles and includes the following steps:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style='format (%C)'>
            <t>
              The client requests authorization from the resource owner. The authorization request
              can be made directly to the resource owner (as shown), or preferably indirectly via
              the authorization server as an intermediary.
            </t>
            <t>
              The client receives an authorization grant, which is a credential representing
              the resource owner's authorization, expressed using one of four grant types defined
              in this specification or using an extension grant type. The authorization grant type
              depends on the method used by the client to request authorization and the types
              supported by the authorization server.
            </t>
            <t>
              The client requests an access token by authenticating with the authorization server
              and presenting the authorization grant.
            </t>
            <t>
              The authorization server authenticates the client and validates the authorization
              grant, and if valid, issues an access token.
            </t>
            <t>
              The client requests the protected resource from the resource server and authenticates
              by presenting the access token.
            </t>
            <t>
              The resource server validates the access token, and if valid, serves the request.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The preferred method for the client to obtain an authorization grant from the resource
          owner (depicted in steps (A) and (B)) is to use the authorization
server as an intermediary,
          which is illustrated in <xref target='Figure-3'/>
          in <xref target="grant-code"/>.
        </t>

      </section>

      <section title='Authorization Grant'>
        <t>
          An authorization grant is a credential representing the resource owner's authorization
          (to access its protected resources) used by the client to obtain an access token. This
          specification defines four grant types -- authorization code, implicit, resource owner
          password credentials, and client credentials -- as well as an extensibility mechanism for
          defining additional types.
        </t>

        <section title='Authorization Code'>
          <t>
            The authorization code is obtained by using an authorization server as an intermediary
            between the client and resource owner. Instead of requesting authorization directly
            from the resource owner, the client directs the resource owner to an authorization
            server (via its user&nbhy;agent as defined in <xref target='RFC2616' />), which in turn
            directs the resource owner back to the client with the authorization code.
          </t>
          <t>
            Before directing the resource owner back to the client with the authorization code, the
            authorization server authenticates the resource owner and obtains authorization.
            Because the resource owner only authenticates with the authorization server, the
            resource owner's credentials are never shared with the client.
          </t>
          <t>
          The authorization code provides a few important security benefits,
          such as the ability to authenticate the client, as well as the
          transmission of the access token directly to the client without
          passing it through the resource owner's user-agent and potentially
          exposing it to others, including the resource owner.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title='Implicit' anchor="ImplicitIntro">
          <t>
            The implicit grant is a simplified authorization code flow
optimized for clients
            implemented in a browser using a scripting language such as JavaScript. In the implicit
            flow, instead of issuing the client an authorization code, the client is issued an
            access token directly (as the result of the resource owner authorization). The grant
            type is implicit, as no intermediate credentials (such as an authorization code) are
            issued (and later used to obtain an access token).
          </t>
          <t>
            When issuing an access token during the implicit grant flow, the authorization server
            does not authenticate the client. In some cases, the client identity can be verified
            via the redirection URI used to deliver the access token to the client. The access
            token may be exposed to the resource owner or other applications with access to the
            resource owner's user-agent.
          </t>
          <t>
            Implicit grants improve the responsiveness and efficiency of some clients (such as a
            client implemented as an in-browser application), since it reduces the number of round
            trips required to obtain an access token. However, this convenience should be weighed
            against the security implications of using implicit grants,
            such as those described in Sections <xref
target="AccessTokenSecurity" format="counter"/> and
            <xref target="ImplicitImpersonation" format="counter"/>,
            especially when the authorization code grant type is available.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Resource Owner Password Credentials">
          <t>
            The resource owner password credentials (i.e., username and password) can be used
            directly as an authorization grant to obtain an access token. The credentials should
            only be used when there is a high degree of trust between the resource owner and the
            client (e.g., the client is part of the device operating system or a highly privileged
            application), and when other authorization grant types are not available (such as an
            authorization code).
          </t>
          <t>
            Even though this grant type requires direct client access to the resource owner
            credentials, the resource owner credentials are used for a single request and are
            exchanged for an access token. This grant type can eliminate the need for the client
            to store the resource owner credentials for future use, by exchanging the credentials
            with a long-lived access token or refresh token.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title='Client Credentials'>
          <t>
            The client credentials (or other forms of client authentication) can be used as an
            authorization grant when the authorization scope is limited to the protected resources
            under the control of the client, or to protected resources previously arranged with the
            authorization server. Client credentials are used as an authorization grant typically
            when the client is acting on its own behalf (the client is also the resource owner) or
            is requesting access to protected resources based on an authorization previously
            arranged with the authorization server.
          </t>
        </section>

      </section>

      <section title='Access Token'>
        <t>
          Access tokens are credentials used to access protected resources. An access token is a
          string representing an authorization issued to the client. The string is usually opaque
          to the client. Tokens represent specific scopes and durations of access, granted by the
          resource owner, and enforced by the resource server and authorization server.
        </t>
        <t>
          The token may denote an identifier used to retrieve the authorization
information or may
          self-contain the authorization information in a verifiable manner (i.e., a token string
          consisting of some data and a signature). Additional authentication credentials, which
          are beyond the scope of this specification, may be required in order for the client to
          use a token.
        </t>
        <t>
          The access token provides an abstraction layer, replacing different authorization
          constructs (e.g., username and password) with a single token understood by the resource
          server. This abstraction enables issuing access tokens more restrictive than the
          authorization grant used to obtain them, as well as removing the resource server's need to
          understand a wide range of authentication methods.
        </t>
        <t>
          Access tokens can have different formats, structures, and methods of utilization (e.g.,
          cryptographic properties) based on the resource server security requirements. Access token
          attributes and the methods used to access protected resources are beyond the scope of this
          specification and are defined by companion specifications such as
<xref target="RFC6750"/>.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Refresh Token'>
        <t>
          Refresh tokens are credentials used to obtain access tokens. Refresh tokens are issued to
          the client by the authorization server and are used to obtain a new access token when the
          current access token becomes invalid or expires, or to obtain additional access tokens
          with identical or narrower scope (access tokens may have a shorter lifetime and fewer
          permissions than authorized by the resource owner). Issuing a refresh token is optional
          at the discretion of the authorization server. If the authorization server issues a
          refresh token, it is included when issuing an access token (i.e., step (D) in
          <xref target='Figure-1' />).
        </t>
        <t>
          A refresh token is a string representing the authorization granted to the client by the
          resource owner. The string is usually opaque to the client. The token denotes an
          identifier used to retrieve the authorization information. Unlike access tokens, refresh
          tokens are intended for use only with authorization servers and are never sent to
          resource servers.

        </t>
        <t>
          <list style='format (%C)'>
            <t>
              The client requests an access token by authenticating with the authorization server
              and presenting an authorization grant.
            </t>
            <t>
              The authorization server authenticates the client and validates the authorization
              grant, and if valid, issues an access token and a refresh token.
            </t>
            <t>
              The client makes a protected resource request to the resource server by presenting
              the access token.
            </t>
            <t>
              The resource server validates the access token, and if valid, serves the request.
            </t>
            <t>
              Steps (C) and (D) repeat until the access token expires. If the client knows the
              access token expired, it skips to step (G); otherwise, it makes another protected
              resource request.
            </t>
            <t>
              Since the access token is invalid, the resource server returns an invalid token
              error.
            </t>
            <t>
              The client requests a new access token by authenticating with the authorization
              server and presenting the refresh token. The client authentication requirements are
              based on the client type and on the authorization server policies.
            </t>
            <t>
              The authorization server authenticates the client and validates the refresh token,
              and if valid, issues a new access token (and, optionally, a new refresh token).
            </t>

      <section title='TLS Version' anchor='tls'>
        <t>
          Whenever Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used by this specification, the appropriate version (or versions) of
          TLS will vary over time, based on the widespread deployment and known security
          vulnerabilities. At the time of this writing, TLS version 1.2 <xref target='RFC5246' />
          is the most recent version, but has a very limited deployment base and might not be
          readily available for implementation. TLS version 1.0 <xref target='RFC2246' /> is the
          most widely deployed version and will provide the broadest interoperability.
        </t>
        <t>
          Implementations MAY also support additional transport-layer security mechanisms
          that meet their security requirements.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='HTTP Redirections'>
        <t>
          This specification makes extensive use of HTTP redirections, in which the client or the
          authorization server directs the resource owner's user-agent to another destination. While
          the examples in this specification show the use of the HTTP 302 status code, any other
          method available via the user-agent to accomplish this redirection is allowed and is
          considered to be an implementation detail.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Interoperability'>
        <t>
          OAuth 2.0 provides a rich authorization framework with well-defined security properties.
          However, as a rich and highly extensible framework with many optional components, on its
          own, this specification is likely to produce a wide range of non-interoperable
          implementations.
        </t>
        <t>
          In addition, this specification leaves a few required components partially or fully
          undefined (e.g., client registration, authorization server capabilities, endpoint
          discovery). Without these components, clients must be manually and specifically
          configured against a specific authorization server and resource server in order to
          interoperate.
        </t>
        <t>
          This framework was designed with the clear expectation that future work will define
          prescriptive profiles and extensions necessary to achieve full web-scale
          interoperability.

          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
          NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this specification are to be interpreted as
          described in <xref target='RFC2119' />.
        </t>
        <t>
          This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of
          <xref target='RFC5234' />.
          Additionally, the rule URI-reference is included from
          "Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax" <xref target='RFC3986' />.

        <t>
          Certain security-related terms are to be understood in the sense defined in
          <xref target='RFC4949' />. These terms include, but are not limited to, "attack",

    </section>

    <section title='Client Registration'>
      <t>
        Before initiating the protocol, the client registers with the authorization server. The
        means through which the client registers with the authorization server are beyond the
        scope of this specification but typically involve end-user interaction with an HTML
        registration form.
      </t>
      <t>
        Client registration does not require a direct interaction between the client and the
        authorization server. When supported by the authorization server, registration can rely
        on other means for establishing trust and obtaining the required client properties (e.g.,
        redirection URI, client type). For example, registration can be accomplished using a
        self-issued or third-party-issued assertion, or by the authorization server performing
        client discovery using a trusted channel.
      </t>
      <t>
        When registering a client, the client developer SHALL:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            specify the client type as described in <xref target='client-types' />,
          </t>
          <t>
            provide its client redirection URIs as described in
            <xref target='redirect-uri' />, and
          </t>
          <t>
            include any other information required by the authorization server (e.g., application
            name, website, description, logo image, the acceptance of legal terms).
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <section title='Client Types' anchor='client-types'>
        <t>
          OAuth defines two client types, based on their ability to authenticate securely with the
          authorization server (i.e., ability to maintain the confidentiality of their client
          credentials):
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style='hanging'>
            <t hangText='confidential'>
              <vspace />
              Clients capable of maintaining the confidentiality of their credentials (e.g.,
              client implemented on a secure server with restricted access to the client
              credentials), or capable of secure client authentication using other means.
            </t>
            <t hangText='public'>
              <vspace />
              Clients incapable of maintaining the confidentiality of their credentials (e.g.,
              clients executing on the device used by the resource owner, such as an installed
              native application or a web browser-based application), and incapable of secure
              client authentication via any other means.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The client type designation is based on the authorization server's definition of secure
          authentication and its acceptable exposure levels of client credentials. The
          authorization server SHOULD NOT make assumptions about the client type.
        </t>
        <t>
          A client may be implemented as a distributed set of components, each with a different
          client type and security context (e.g., a distributed client with both a confidential
          server-based component and a public browser-based component). If the authorization server
          does not provide support for such clients or does not provide guidance with regard to
          their registration, the client SHOULD register each component as a separate client.
        </t>
        <t>
          This specification has been designed around the following client profiles:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style='hanging'>
            <t hangText='web application'>
              <vspace />
              A web application is a confidential client running on a web server. Resource owners
              access the client via an HTML user interface rendered in a user-agent on the device
              used by the resource owner. The client credentials as well as any access token issued
              to the client are stored on the web server and are not exposed to or accessible by
              the resource owner.
            </t>
            <t hangText='user-agent-based application'>
              <vspace />
              A user-agent-based application is a public client in which the client code is
              downloaded from a web server and executes within a user-agent (e.g., web browser) on
              the device used by the resource owner. Protocol data and credentials are easily
              accessible (and often visible) to the resource owner. Since such applications reside
              within the user-agent, they can make seamless use of the user-agent capabilities when
              requesting authorization.
            </t>
            <t hangText='native application'>
              <vspace />
              A native application is a public client installed and executed on the device used by
              the resource owner. Protocol data and credentials are accessible to the resource
              owner. It is assumed that any client authentication credentials included in the
              application can be extracted. On the other hand, dynamically issued credentials such
              as access tokens or refresh tokens can receive an acceptable level of protection. At a
              minimum, these credentials are protected from hostile servers with which the
              application may interact. On some platforms, these credentials might be protected
              from other applications residing on the same device.
            </t>

      </section>

      <section title='Client Identifier' anchor='client-identifier'>
        <t>
          The authorization server issues the registered client a client identifier -- a unique
          string representing the registration information provided by the client. The client
          identifier is not a secret; it is exposed to the resource owner and MUST NOT be used
          alone for client authentication. The client identifier is unique to the authorization
          server.
        </t>
        <t>
          The client identifier string size is left undefined by this specification. The client
          should avoid making assumptions about the identifier size.  The authorization server
          SHOULD document the size of any identifier it issues.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Client Authentication' anchor='client-authentication'>
        <t>
          If the client type is confidential, the client and authorization server establish a client
          authentication method suitable for the security requirements of the authorization server.
          The authorization server MAY accept any form of client authentication meeting its
          security requirements.
        </t>
        <t>
          Confidential clients are typically issued (or establish) a set of client credentials used for
          authenticating with the authorization server (e.g., password, public/private key pair).
        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization server MAY establish a client authentication method with public clients.
          However, the authorization server MUST NOT rely on public client authentication for the
          purpose of identifying the client.
        </t>
        <t>
          The client MUST NOT use more than one authentication method in each request.
        </t>

        <section title='Client Password' anchor="client-password">
          <t>
            Clients in possession of a client password MAY use the HTTP Basic authentication scheme
            as defined in <xref target='RFC2617' /> to authenticate with the authorization server.
            The client identifier is encoded using the
            <spanx style='verb'>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</spanx>
            encoding algorithm per <xref target="urlencoded"/>, and the encoded value is
            used as the username; the client password is encoded using
            the same algorithm and used as the
            password. The authorization server MUST support the HTTP Basic authentication scheme
            for authenticating clients that were issued a client password.

            The authorization server MAY support any suitable HTTP authentication scheme matching
            its security requirements. When using other authentication methods, the authorization
            server MUST define a mapping between the client identifier (registration record) and
            authentication scheme.

          This specification does not exclude the use of unregistered clients. However, the use

      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            Authorization endpoint - used by the client to obtain authorization from the resource
            owner via user-agent redirection.
          </t>
          <t>
            Token endpoint - used by the client to exchange an authorization grant for an access
            token, typically with client authentication.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        As well as one client endpoint:

      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            Redirection endpoint - used by the authorization server to return
            responses containing authorization credentials to the client via
            the resource owner user-agent.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Not every authorization grant type utilizes both endpoints. Extension grant types MAY
        define additional endpoints as needed.
      </t>

      <section title='Authorization Endpoint'>
        <t>
          The authorization endpoint is used to interact with the resource owner and obtain
          an authorization grant. The authorization server MUST first verify the identity of the
          resource owner. The way in which the authorization server authenticates the resource
          owner (e.g., username and password login, session cookies) is beyond the scope of this
          specification.
        </t>
        <t>
          The means through which the client obtains the location of the authorization endpoint are
          beyond the scope of this specification, but the location is typically provided in the
          service documentation.
        </t>
        <t>
          The endpoint URI MAY include an
          <spanx style='verb'>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</spanx> formatted
          (per <xref target="urlencoded"/>) query component (<xref target='RFC3986' />
          Section 3.4), which MUST be retained when adding additional query parameters. The
          endpoint URI MUST NOT include a fragment component.
        </t>
        <t>
          Since requests to the authorization endpoint result in user authentication and the
          transmission of clear-text credentials (in the HTTP response), the authorization server
          MUST require the use of TLS as described in <xref target='tls' /> when sending requests
          to the authorization endpoint.
        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization server MUST support the use of the HTTP <spanx style='verb'>GET</spanx>
          method <xref target='RFC2616' /> for the authorization endpoint and MAY support the use
          of the <spanx style='verb'>POST</spanx> method as well.
        </t>
        <t>
          Parameters sent without a value MUST be treated as if they were omitted from the request.
          The authorization server MUST ignore unrecognized request parameters. Request and

              The redirection endpoint SHOULD require the use of TLS as described in

              over an open network. This specification does not mandate the use of TLS because at
              the time of this writing, requiring clients to deploy TLS is a significant hurdle for
              many client developers. If TLS is not available, the authorization server SHOULD warn
              the resource owner about the insecure endpoint prior to redirection (e.g., display a

              Lack of transport-layer security can have a severe impact on the security of the

              transport-layer security is particularly critical when the authorization process is
              used as a form of delegated end-user authentication by the client (e.g., third-party

            <t>
              The authorization server SHOULD require the client to provide the complete

              parameter to achieve per-request customization). If requiring the registration of
              the complete redirection URI is not possible, the authorization server SHOULD require
              the registration of the URI scheme, authority, and path (allowing the client to
              dynamically vary only the query component of the redirection URI when requesting
              authorization).

              If an authorization request fails validation due to a missing, invalid, or

          <section title='Endpoint Content'>
            <t>
              The redirection request to the client's endpoint typically results in an HTML
              document response, processed by the user-agent. If the HTML response is served
              directly as the result of the redirection request, any script included in the HTML
              document will execute with full access to the redirection URI and the credentials it

              The client SHOULD NOT include any third-party scripts (e.g., third-party analytics,
              social plug-ins, ad networks) in the redirection endpoint response. Instead, it
              SHOULD extract the credentials from the URI and redirect the user-agent again to
              another endpoint without exposing the credentials (in the URI or elsewhere). If
              third-party scripts are included, the client MUST ensure that its own scripts

      <section title='Token Endpoint'>
        <t>
          The token endpoint is used by the client to obtain an access token by presenting its
          authorization grant or refresh token. The token endpoint is used with every authorization
          grant except for the implicit grant type (since an access token is issued directly).
        </t>

          The means through which the client obtains the location of the token endpoint are
          beyond the scope of this specification, but the location is typically provided in the service
          documentation.
        </t>
        <t>
          The endpoint URI MAY include an
          <spanx style='verb'>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</spanx> formatted

          Section 3.4), which MUST be retained when adding additional query parameters. The
          endpoint URI MUST NOT include a fragment component.
        </t>
        <t>
          Since requests to the token endpoint result in the transmission of clear-text credentials
          (in the HTTP request and response), the authorization server MUST require the use of TLS
          as described in <xref target='tls' /> when sending requests to the token endpoint.
        </t>
        <t>
          The client MUST use the HTTP <spanx style='verb'>POST</spanx> method when making access
          token requests.
        </t>
        <t>
          Parameters sent without a value MUST be treated as if they were omitted from the request.
          The authorization server MUST ignore unrecognized request parameters. Request and

        <section title='Client Authentication' anchor='token-endpoint-auth'>

            Confidential clients or other clients issued client credentials MUST authenticate with

            inadvertently accepting a code intended for a client with a different
            <spanx style='verb'>client_id</spanx>.  This protects the client from substitution of the
            authentication code.  (It provides no additional security for the

      <section title='Access Token Scope' anchor='scope'>
        <t>
          The authorization and token endpoints allow the client to specify the scope of the access
          request using the <spanx style='verb'>scope</spanx> request parameter. In turn, the
          authorization server uses the <spanx style='verb'>scope</spanx> response parameter to
          inform the client of the scope of the access token issued.
        </t>
        <t>
          The value of the scope parameter is expressed as a list of space-delimited, case-sensitive strings. The strings are defined by the authorization server. If the value
          contains multiple space-delimited strings, their order does not matter, and each string
          adds an additional access range to the requested scope.

        <t>
          The authorization server MAY fully or partially ignore the scope requested by the client,
          based on the authorization server policy or the resource owner's instructions. If the
          issued access token scope is different from the one requested by the client, the
          authorization server MUST include the <spanx style='verb'>scope</spanx> response
          parameter to inform the client of the actual scope granted.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the client omits the scope parameter when requesting authorization, the authorization
          server MUST either process the request using a pre-defined default value or fail the
          request indicating an invalid scope. The authorization server SHOULD document its scope
          requirements and default value (if defined).

    <section title='Obtaining Authorization'>
      <t>
        To request an access token, the client obtains authorization from the resource owner. The
        authorization is expressed in the form of an authorization grant, which the client uses to
        request the access token. OAuth defines four grant types: authorization code, implicit,
        resource owner password credentials, and client credentials. It also provides an extension
        mechanism for defining additional grant types.
      </t>

      <section title='Authorization Code Grant' anchor='grant-code'>
        <t>
          The authorization code grant type is used to obtain both access tokens and refresh
          tokens and is optimized for confidential clients. Since this is a redirection-based flow, the client
          must be capable of interacting with the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web
          browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection) from the
          authorization server.

        <t>
          <list style='format (%C)'>
            <t>
              The client initiates the flow by directing the resource owner's user-agent to the
              authorization endpoint. The client includes its client identifier, requested
              scope, local state, and a redirection URI to which the authorization server will send
              the user-agent back once access is granted (or denied).
            </t>
            <t>
              The authorization server authenticates the resource owner (via the user-agent) and
              establishes whether the resource owner grants or denies the client's access request.
            </t>
            <t>
              Assuming the resource owner grants access, the authorization server redirects the
              user-agent back to the client using the redirection URI provided earlier (in the
              request or during client registration). The redirection URI includes an authorization
              code and any local state provided by the client earlier.
            </t>
            <t>
              The client requests an access token from the authorization server's token endpoint
              by including the authorization code received in the previous step. When making the
              request, the client authenticates with the authorization server. The client includes
              the redirection URI used to obtain the authorization code for verification.
            </t>
            <t>
              The authorization server authenticates the client, validates the authorization code,
              and ensures that the redirection URI received matches the URI used to redirect the client
              in step&nbsp;(C). If valid, the authorization server responds back with an access token

      <section title='Implicit Grant' anchor='grant-implicit'>
        <t>
          The implicit grant type is used to obtain access tokens (it does not support the issuance
          of refresh tokens) and is optimized for public clients known to operate a particular
          redirection URI. These clients are typically implemented in a browser using a scripting
          language such as JavaScript.
        </t>
        <t>
          Since this is a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of interacting with the
          resource owner's user-agent (typically a web browser) and capable of receiving incoming
          requests (via redirection) from the authorization server.
        </t>
        <t>
          Unlike the authorization code grant type, in which the client makes separate requests for
          authorization and for an access token, the client receives the access token as the result of the
          authorization request.
        </t>
        <t>
          The implicit grant type does not include client authentication, and relies on the
          presence of the resource owner and the registration of the redirection URI. Because the
          access token is encoded into the redirection URI, it may be exposed to the resource owner
          and other applications residing on the same device.

            <t>
              The authorization server authenticates the resource owner (via the user-agent) and
              establishes whether the resource owner grants or denies the client's access request.
            </t>
            <t>
              Assuming the resource owner grants access, the authorization server redirects the
              user-agent back to the client using the redirection URI provided earlier. The
              redirection URI includes the access token in the URI fragment.
            </t>
            <t>
              The user-agent follows the redirection instructions by making a request to the
              web-hosted client resource (which does not include the fragment per
              <xref target='RFC2616' />). The user-agent retains the fragment information locally.
            </t>
            <t>
              The web-hosted client resource returns a web page (typically an HTML document with an
              embedded script) capable of accessing the full redirection URI including the fragment
              retained by the user-agent, and extracting the access token (and other parameters)
              contained in the fragment.
            </t>
            <t>
              The user-agent executes the script provided by the web-hosted client resource
              locally, which extracts the access token.</t>
            <t>The user-agent passes the access token to the client.

        If the authorization server issued a refresh token to the client, the client makes a
        refresh request to the token endpoint by adding the following parameters using the
        <spanx style='verb'>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</spanx> format
        per <xref target="urlencoded"/> with a character encoding of UTF-8
        in the HTTP request entity-body:

          <t hangText='refresh_token'>
            <vspace />
            REQUIRED. The refresh token issued to the client.

          <t hangText='scope'>
            <vspace />
            OPTIONAL. The scope of the access request as described by <xref target='scope' />.
            The requested scope MUST NOT include any scope not originally granted by the resource
            owner, and if omitted is treated as equal to the scope originally granted by the
            resource owner.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Because refresh tokens are typically long-lasting credentials used to request additional
        access tokens, the refresh token is bound to the client to which it was issued. If the client type
        is confidential or the client was issued client credentials (or assigned other
        authentication requirements), the client MUST authenticate with the authorization server as
        described in <xref target='token-endpoint-auth' />.
      </t>
      <figure>
        <preamble>
          For example, the client makes the following HTTP request using transport-layer
          security (with extra line breaks for display purposes only):

        The authorization server MUST:

      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            require client authentication for confidential clients or for any client that was
            issued client credentials (or with other authentication requirements),
          </t>
          <t>
            authenticate the client if client authentication is included and ensure that the
            refresh token was issued to the authenticated client, and
          </t>
          <t>
            validate the refresh token.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        If valid and authorized, the authorization server issues an access token as described in
        <xref target='token-response' />. If the request failed verification or is invalid, the
        authorization server returns an error response as described in
        <xref target='token-errors' />.
      </t>
      <t>
        The authorization server MAY issue a new refresh token, in which case the client MUST
        discard the old refresh token and replace it with the new refresh token. The authorization
        server MAY revoke the old refresh token after issuing a new refresh token to the client. If
        a new refresh token is issued, the refresh token scope MUST be identical to that of the
        refresh token included by the client in the request.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title='Accessing Protected Resources' anchor='access-resource'>
      <t>
        The client accesses protected resources by presenting the access token to the resource
        server. The resource server MUST validate the access token and ensure that it has not expired
        and that its scope covers the requested resource. The methods used by the resource server
        to validate the access token (as well as any error responses) are beyond the scope of this
        specification but generally involve an interaction or coordination between the resource
        server and the authorization server.
      </t>
      <t>
        The method in which the client utilizes the access token to authenticate with the resource
        server depends on the type of access token issued by the authorization server. Typically,
        it involves using the HTTP <spanx style='verb'>Authorization</spanx> request header field
        <xref target='RFC2617' /> with an authentication scheme defined by the
      specification of the access token type used, such as <xref target="RFC6750"/>.
      </t>

      <section title='Access Token Types' anchor='token-types'>
        <t>
          The access token type provides the client with the information required to successfully
          utilize the access token to make a protected resource request (along with type-specific
          attributes). The client MUST NOT use an access token if it does not understand the token
          type.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>
            For example, the <spanx style='verb'>bearer</spanx> token type defined in
            <xref target='RFC6750' /> is utilized by simply including the access
            token string in the request:

            while the <spanx style='verb'>mac</spanx> token type defined in
            <xref target='OAuth-HTTP-MAC' /> is utilized by issuing a 
            Message Authentication Code (MAC) key
            together with the access token that is used to sign certain components of the HTTP

          consult the <xref target='RFC6750' /> and
          <xref target='OAuth-HTTP-MAC' /> specifications before use.
        </t>
        <t>
          Each access token type definition specifies the additional attributes (if any) sent to
          the client together with the <spanx style='verb'>access_token</spanx> response parameter.
          It also defines the HTTP authentication method used to include the access token when
          making a protected resource request.

      <section title='Error Response' anchor='resource-errors'>
        <t>
          If a resource access request fails, the resource server SHOULD inform
          the client of the error.  While the specifics of such error responses
          are beyond the scope of this specification, this document establishes
          a common registry in <xref target='error-registry' /> for error values
          to be shared among OAuth token authentication schemes. 
        </t>
        <t>
          New authentication schemes designed primarily for OAuth token
          authentication SHOULD define a mechanism for providing an
          error status code to the client, in which the error values allowed are
          registered in the error registry established by this specification. Such
          schemes MAY limit the set of valid error codes to a subset of the
          registered values. If the error code is returned using a named parameter,
          the parameter name SHOULD be <spanx style='verb'>error</spanx>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Other schemes capable of being used for OAuth token authentication, but
          not primarily designed for that purpose, MAY bind their error values to the
          registry in the same manner.
        </t>
        <t>
          New authentication schemes MAY choose to also specify the use of the

    <section title='Native Applications' anchor="NativeApps">
      <t>
        Native applications are clients installed and executed on the device used by the resource
        owner (i.e., desktop application, native mobile application). Native applications require
        special consideration related to security, platform capabilities, and overall end-user
        experience.
      </t>
      <t>
        The authorization endpoint requires interaction between the client and the resource
        owner's user-agent. Native applications can invoke an external user-agent or embed a
        user-agent within the application. For example:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            External user-agent - the native application can capture the response from the
            authorization server using a redirection URI with a scheme registered with the
            operating system to invoke the client as the handler, manual copy-and-paste of the
            credentials, running a local web server, installing a user-agent extension, or by
            providing a redirection URI identifying a server-hosted resource under the client's
            control, which in turn makes the response available to the native application.
          </t>
          <t>
            Embedded user-agent - the native application obtains the response by directly
            communicating with the embedded user-agent by monitoring state changes emitted during
            the resource load, or accessing the user-agent's cookies storage.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        When choosing between an external or embedded user-agent, developers
should consider the following:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            An external user-agent may improve completion rate, as the resource owner may already have
            an active session with the authorization server, removing the need to re-authenticate. It
            provides a familiar end-user experience and functionality. The resource owner may also
            rely on user-agent features or extensions to assist with authentication (e.g., password
            manager, 2-factor device reader).
          </t>
          <t>
            An embedded user-agent may offer improved usability, as it removes the need to switch
            context and open new windows.
          </t>
          <t>
            An embedded user-agent poses a security challenge because resource owners are
            authenticating in an unidentified window without access to the visual protections found
            in most external user-agents. An embedded user-agent educates end-users to trust
            unidentified requests for authentication (making phishing attacks easier to execute).
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        When choosing between the implicit grant type and the authorization code grant type, the

      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            Native applications that use the authorization code grant type SHOULD do so without
            using client credentials, due to the native application's inability to keep client
            credentials confidential.
          </t>
          <t>
            When using the implicit grant type flow, a refresh token is not returned, which requires

    <section title='Security Considerations'>
      <t>
        As a flexible and extensible framework, OAuth's security considerations depend on many
        factors. The following sections provide implementers with security guidelines focused on
        the three client profiles described in <xref target='client-types' />: web application,
        user&nbhy;agent&nbhy;based application, and native application.
      </t>
      <t>
        A comprehensive OAuth security model and analysis, as well as background for the protocol
        design, is provided by <xref target='OAuth-THREATMODEL' />.
      </t>

      <section title='Client Authentication'>
        <t>
          The authorization server establishes client credentials with web application clients for
          the purpose of client authentication. The authorization server is encouraged to consider
          stronger client authentication means than a client password. Web application clients MUST
          ensure confidentiality of client passwords and other client credentials.
        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization server MUST NOT issue client passwords or other client credentials to
          native application or user-agent-based application clients for the purpose of client
          authentication. The authorization server MAY issue a client password or other credentials
          for a specific installation of a native application client on a specific device.
        </t>
        <t>
          When client authentication is not possible, the authorization server SHOULD employ other
          means to validate the client's identity -- for example, by requiring the registration of
          the client redirection URI or enlisting the resource owner to confirm identity. A valid
          redirection URI is not sufficient to verify the client's identity when asking for
          resource owner authorization but can be used to prevent delivering credentials to a
          counterfeit client after obtaining resource owner authorization.
        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization server must consider the security implications of interacting with
          unauthenticated clients and take measures to limit the potential exposure of other
          credentials (e.g., refresh tokens) issued to such clients.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Client Impersonation'>
        <t>
          A malicious client can impersonate another client and obtain access to protected
          resources if the impersonated client fails to, or is unable to, keep its client
          credentials confidential.
        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization server MUST authenticate the client whenever possible. If the
          authorization server cannot authenticate the client due to the client's nature, the
          authorization server MUST require the registration of any redirection URI used for
          receiving authorization responses and SHOULD utilize other means to protect resource
          owners from such potentially malicious clients. For example, the authorization server
          can engage the resource owner to assist in identifying the client and its origin.
        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization server SHOULD enforce explicit resource owner authentication and
          provide the resource owner with information about the client and the requested
          authorization scope and lifetime. It is up to the resource owner to review the
          information in the context of the current client and to authorize or deny the request.
        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization server SHOULD NOT process repeated authorization requests
          automatically (without active resource owner interaction) without authenticating the
          client or relying on other measures to ensure that the repeated request comes from the
          original client and not an impersonator.

      <section title='Access Tokens' anchor="AccessTokenSecurity">
        <t>
          Access token credentials (as well as any confidential access token attributes) MUST be

          the resource servers the access token is valid for, and the client to whom the access
          token is issued. Access token credentials MUST only be transmitted using TLS as described

          When using the implicit grant type, the access token is transmitted in the URI fragment,
          which can expose it to unauthorized parties.
        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization server MUST ensure that access tokens cannot be generated, modified, or
          guessed to produce valid access tokens by unauthorized parties.
        </t>
        <t>
          The client SHOULD request access tokens with the minimal scope necessary. The
          authorization server SHOULD take the client identity into account when choosing how
          to honor the requested scope and MAY issue an access token with less rights than
          requested.
        </t>
        <t>
          This specification does not provide any methods for the resource server to ensure that an
          access token presented to it by a given client was issued to that client by the
          authorization server.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Refresh Tokens'>
        <t>
          Authorization servers MAY issue refresh tokens to web application clients and native
          application clients.
        </t>
        <t>
          Refresh tokens MUST be kept confidential in transit and storage, and shared only among
          the authorization server and the client to whom the refresh tokens were issued. The
          authorization server MUST maintain the binding between a refresh token and the client to
          whom it was issued. Refresh tokens MUST only be transmitted using TLS as described in
          <xref target='tls' /> with server authentication as defined by <xref target='RFC2818' />.
        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization server MUST verify the binding between the refresh token and client
          identity whenever the client identity can be authenticated. When client authentication is
          not possible, the authorization server SHOULD deploy other means to detect refresh token
          abuse.
        </t>
        <t>
          For example, the authorization server could employ refresh token rotation in which a new
          refresh token is issued with every access token refresh response. The previous refresh
          token is invalidated but retained by the authorization server. If a refresh token is
          compromised and subsequently used by both the attacker and the legitimate client, one of
          them will present an invalidated refresh token, which will inform the authorization server
          of the breach.
        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization server MUST ensure that refresh tokens cannot be generated, modified,
          or guessed to produce valid refresh tokens by unauthorized parties.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Authorization Codes'>
        <t>
          The transmission of authorization codes SHOULD be made over a secure channel, and the
          client SHOULD require the use of TLS with its redirection URI if the URI identifies a
          network resource. Since authorization codes are transmitted via user-agent redirections,
          they could potentially be disclosed through user-agent history and HTTP referrer headers.
        </t>
        <t>
          Authorization codes operate as plaintext bearer credentials, used to verify that the
          resource owner who granted authorization at the authorization server is the same
          resource owner returning to the client to complete the process. Therefore, if the client
          relies on the authorization code for its own resource owner authentication, the client
          redirection endpoint MUST require the use of TLS.
        </t>
        <t>
          Authorization codes MUST be short lived and single-use. If the authorization server
          observes multiple attempts to exchange an authorization code for an access token, the
          authorization server SHOULD attempt to revoke all access tokens already granted based on
          the compromised authorization code.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the client can be authenticated, the authorization servers MUST authenticate the
          client and ensure that the authorization code was issued to the same client.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Authorization Code Redirection URI Manipulation'>
        <t>
          When requesting authorization using the authorization code grant type, the client can
          specify a redirection URI via the <spanx style='verb'>redirect_uri</spanx> parameter.
          If an attacker can manipulate the value of the redirection URI, it can cause the
          authorization server to redirect the resource owner user-agent to a URI under the control
          of the attacker with the authorization code.
        </t>
        <t>
          An attacker can create an account at a legitimate client and initiate the authorization
          flow. When the attacker's user-agent is sent to the authorization server to grant access,
          the attacker grabs the authorization URI provided by the legitimate client and replaces
          the client's redirection URI with a URI under the control of the attacker. The attacker
          then tricks the victim into following the manipulated link to authorize access to the
          legitimate client.
        </t>
        <t>
          Once at the authorization server, the victim is prompted with a normal, valid request on
          behalf of a legitimate and trusted client, and authorizes the request. The victim is
          then redirected to an endpoint under the control of the attacker with the authorization
          code. The attacker completes the authorization flow by sending the authorization code to
          the client using the original redirection URI provided by the client. The client
          exchanges the authorization code with an access token and links it to the attacker's
          client account, which can now gain access to the protected resources authorized by the
          victim (via the client).
        </t>
        <t>
          In order to prevent such an attack, the authorization server MUST ensure that the
          redirection URI used to obtain the authorization code is identical to the redirection URI
          provided when exchanging the authorization code for an access token. The authorization
          server MUST require public clients and SHOULD require confidential clients to register
          their redirection URIs. If a redirection URI is provided in the request, the
          authorization server MUST validate it against the registered value.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Resource Owner Password Credentials'>
        <t>
          The resource owner password credentials grant type is often used for legacy or migration
          reasons. It reduces the overall risk of storing usernames and passwords by the client but
          does not eliminate the need to expose highly privileged credentials to the client.
        </t>
        <t>
          This grant type carries a higher risk than other grant types because it maintains the
          password anti-pattern this protocol seeks to avoid. The client could abuse the password,
          or the password could unintentionally be disclosed to an attacker (e.g., via log files or
          other records kept by the client).
        </t>
        <t>
          Additionally, because the resource owner does not have control over the authorization
          process (the resource owner's involvement ends when it hands over its credentials to the
          client), the client can obtain access tokens with a broader scope than desired by the
          resource owner. The authorization server should consider the scope and lifetime of
          access tokens issued via this grant type.
        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization server and client SHOULD minimize use of this grant type and utilize
          other grant types whenever possible.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Request Confidentiality'>
        <t>
          Access tokens, refresh tokens, resource owner passwords, and client credentials MUST NOT
          be transmitted in the clear. Authorization codes SHOULD NOT be transmitted in the clear.
        </t>
        <t>
          The <spanx style='verb'>state</spanx> and <spanx style='verb'>scope</spanx> parameters
          SHOULD NOT include sensitive client or resource owner information in plain text, as they
          can be transmitted over insecure channels or stored insecurely.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Ensuring Endpoint Authenticity'>

        <t>
          In order to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, the authorization server MUST require the
          use of TLS with server authentication as defined by <xref target='RFC2818' /> for
          any request sent to the authorization and token endpoints. The client MUST validate the
          authorization server's TLS certificate as defined by <xref target='RFC6125' /> and in
          accordance with its requirements for server identity authentication.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Credentials-Guessing Attacks' anchor='anthropy'>
        <t>
          The authorization server MUST prevent attackers from guessing access tokens,
          authorization codes, refresh tokens, resource owner passwords, and client credentials.
        </t>
        <t>
          The probability of an attacker guessing generated tokens (and other credentials not
          intended for handling by end-users) MUST be less than or equal to 2^(-128) and SHOULD be
          less than or equal to 2^(-160).
        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization server MUST utilize other means to protect credentials intended for
          end-user usage.

      </section>

      <section title='Phishing Attacks'>
        <t>
          Wide deployment of this and similar protocols may cause end-users to become inured
          to the practice of being redirected to websites where they are asked to enter their
          passwords. If end-users are not careful to verify the authenticity of these websites
          before entering their credentials, it will be possible for attackers to exploit this
          practice to steal resource owners' passwords.
        </t>
        <t>
          Service providers should attempt to educate end-users about the risks phishing attacks
          pose and should provide mechanisms that make it easy for end-users to confirm the
          authenticity of their sites. Client developers should consider the security implications
          of how they interact with the user-agent (e.g., external, embedded), and the ability of
          the end-user to verify the authenticity of the authorization server.
        </t>
        <t>
          To reduce the risk of phishing attacks, the authorization servers MUST require the use of
          TLS on every endpoint used for end-user interaction.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Cross-Site Request Forgery' anchor='CSRF'>
        <t>
          Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is an exploit in which an attacker causes the
          user-agent of a victim end-user to follow a malicious URI (e.g., provided to the
          user-agent as a misleading link, image, or redirection) to a trusting server (usually
          established via the presence of a valid session cookie).
        </t>
        <t>
          A CSRF attack against the client's redirection URI allows an attacker to inject its own
          authorization code or access token, which can result in the client using an access token
          associated with the attacker's protected resources rather than the victim's (e.g., save
          the victim's bank account information to a protected resource controlled by the
          attacker).
        </t>
        <t>
          The client MUST implement CSRF protection for its redirection URI. This is typically
          accomplished by requiring any request sent to the redirection URI endpoint to include a
          value that binds the request to the user-agent's authenticated state (e.g., a hash of the
          session cookie used to authenticate the user-agent). The client SHOULD utilize the
          <spanx style='verb'>state</spanx> request parameter to deliver this value to the
          authorization server when making an authorization request.
        </t>
        <t>
          Once authorization has been obtained from the end-user, the authorization server
          redirects the end-user's user-agent back to the client with the required binding value
          contained in the <spanx style='verb'>state</spanx> parameter. The binding value enables
          the client to verify the validity of the request by matching the binding value to the
          user&nbhy;agent's authenticated state. The binding value used for CSRF protection MUST contain
          a non-guessable value (as described in <xref target='anthropy' />), and the user-agent's
          authenticated state (e.g., session cookie, HTML5 local storage) MUST be kept in a location
          accessible only to the client and the user-agent (i.e., protected by same-origin policy).
        </t>
        <t>
          A CSRF attack against the authorization server's authorization endpoint can result in an
          attacker obtaining end-user authorization for a malicious client without involving or
          alerting the end-user.
        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization server MUST implement CSRF protection for its authorization endpoint
          and ensure that a malicious client cannot obtain authorization without the awareness and
          explicit consent of the resource owner.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Clickjacking'>
        <t>
          In a clickjacking attack, an attacker registers a legitimate client and then constructs a
          malicious site in which it loads the authorization server's authorization endpoint web
          page in a transparent iframe overlaid on top of a set of dummy buttons, which are
          carefully constructed to be placed directly under important buttons on the authorization
          page. When an end-user clicks a misleading visible button, the end-user is actually
          clicking an invisible button on the authorization page (such as an "Authorize" button).
          This allows an attacker to trick a resource owner into granting its client access without
          the end-user's knowledge.
        </t>
        <t>
          To prevent this form of attack, native applications SHOULD use external browsers instead
          of embedding browsers within the application when requesting end-user authorization. For
          most newer browsers, avoidance of iframes can be enforced by the authorization server
          using the (non-standard) <spanx style='verb'>x-frame-options</spanx> header. This header
          can have two values, <spanx style='verb'>deny</spanx> and
          <spanx style='verb'>sameorigin</spanx>, which will block any framing, or framing by sites
          with a different origin, respectively. For older browsers, JavaScript frame-busting
          techniques can be used but may not be effective in all browsers.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Code Injection and Input Validation'>
        <t>
          A code injection attack occurs when an input or otherwise external variable is used by an
          application unsanitized and causes modification to the application logic. This may allow
          an attacker to gain access to the application device or its data, cause denial of
          service, or introduce a wide range of malicious side-effects.
        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization server and client MUST sanitize (and validate when possible) any value
          received -- in particular, the value of the <spanx style='verb'>state</spanx> and
          <spanx style='verb'>redirect_uri</spanx> parameters.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Open Redirectors' anchor='open-redirect'>
        <t>
          The authorization server, authorization endpoint, and client redirection endpoint can
          be improperly configured and operate as open redirectors. An open redirector is an
          endpoint using a parameter to automatically redirect a user-agent to the location
          specified by the parameter value without any validation.
        </t>
        <t>
          Open redirectors can be used in phishing attacks, or by an attacker to get end-users to
          visit malicious sites by using the URI authority component of a
          familiar and trusted destination.
 In addition, if the authorization server allows the client to register only
          part of the redirection URI, an attacker can use an open redirector operated by the
          client to construct a redirection URI that will pass the authorization server validation
          but will send the authorization code or access token to an endpoint under the control of
          the attacker.

      <section title='Misuse of Access Token to Impersonate Resource Owner in Implicit Flow'
               anchor="ImplicitImpersonation">
        <t>
          For public clients using implicit flows, this specification does not provide any
          method for the client to determine what client an access token was issued to.
        </t>
        <t>
          A resource owner may willingly delegate access to a resource by granting an access token
          to an attacker's malicious client.  This may be due to phishing or some other pretext.
          An attacker may also steal a token via some other mechanism.   
          An attacker may then attempt to impersonate the resource owner by providing the 
          access token to a legitimate public client.
        </t>
        <t>
          In the implicit flow (response_type=token), the attacker can easily switch the token
          in the response from the authorization server,
          replacing the real access token with the one previously issued to the attacker.
        </t>
        <t>
          Servers communicating with native applications that rely on being passed
          an access token in the back channel to identify the user of the client may 
          be similarly compromised by an attacker creating a compromised application
          that can inject arbitrary stolen access tokens.
        </t>
        <t>
          Any public client that makes the assumption that only the resource owner
          can present it with a valid access token for the resource
          is vulnerable to this type of attack.
        </t>
        <t>
          This type of attack may expose information about the resource owner
          at the legitimate client to the attacker (malicious client).
          This will also allow the attacker to perform operations
          at the legitimate client with the same permissions as the resource owner
          who originally granted the access token or authorization code.
        </t>
        <t>
          Authenticating resource owners to clients is out of scope for this
          specification. Any specification that uses the authorization process
          as a form of delegated end-user authentication to the client (e.g.,
          third-party sign-in service) MUST NOT use the implicit flow without
          additional security mechanisms that would enable the client to
          determine if the access token was issued for its use (e.g.,
          audience-restricting the access token).

        (&lt;http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types&gt;).
        Furthermore, that definition is incomplete, as it does not
        consider non-US-ASCII characters.
      </t>
      <t>
        To address this shortcoming when generating payloads using
        this media type, names and values MUST be encoded using the
        UTF-8 character encoding scheme <xref target="RFC3629"/> first;
        the resulting octet sequence then needs to be further encoded using
        the escaping rules defined in <xref target='W3C.REC-html401-19991224'/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        When parsing data from a payload using this media type, the
        names and values resulting from reversing the name/value
        encoding consequently need to be treated as octet sequences,
        to be decoded using the UTF-8 character encoding scheme.
      </t>
      <t>
        For example, the value consisting of the six Unicode code points
        (1)&nbsp;U+0020 (SPACE), (2) U+0025 (PERCENT SIGN),
        (3)&nbsp;U+&wj;0026&nbsp;(AMPERSAND), (4) U+002B (PLUS SIGN),
        (5)&nbsp;U+&wj;00A3&nbsp;(POUND&nbsp;SIGN),
        and (6) U+20AC (EURO SIGN) would be encoded into the octet
        sequence below (using hexadecimal notation):

        and then represented in the payload as:

        The initial OAuth 2.0 protocol specification was edited by David Recordon, based on two
        previous publications: the OAuth 1.0 community specification <xref target='RFC5849' />, and
        OAuth WRAP (OAuth Web Resource Authorization Profiles)
        <xref target='OAuth-WRAP' />. Eran Hammer then
   edited many of the intermediate drafts that evolved into this RFC.
        The Security Considerations section was drafted
        by Torsten Lodderstedt, Mark McGloin, Phil Hunt, Anthony Nadalin, and John Bradley.
        The section on use of the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" media type
        was drafted by Julian Reschke.
        The ABNF section was drafted by Michael B. Jones.
