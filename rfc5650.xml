            This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB)
            module
            for use with network management protocols in the
            Internet community.
            In particular, it describes objects used for managing
            parameters of
            the "Very High Speed Digital Subscriber Line 2 (VDSL2)"
            interface type,
            which are also applicable for managing Asymmetric Digital
Subscriber Line (ADSL), ADSL2, and
            ADSL2+ interfaces.

            Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
            store, termed
            the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are
            generally
            accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol
            (SNMP).
            Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
            in the
            Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo
            specifies a MIB
            module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in
            STD 58,
            RFC 2578 <xref target="RFC2578"/>, STD 58, RFC 2579
            <xref target="RFC2579"/>, and STD 58, RFC 2580 <xref

        <t>
            This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB)
            module for use
            with network management protocols in the Internet community
            for the purpose
            of managing VDSL2, ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2+ lines.
        </t>
        <t>
            The MIB module described in RFC 2662 <xref
            target="RFC2662"/>
            describes objects used for managing Asymmetric Bit-Rate DSL
            (ADSL) interfaces
            per <xref target="T1E1.413"/>, <xref target="G.992.1"/>, and
            <xref target="G.992.2"/>.
            These object descriptions
            are based upon the specifications for the ADSL Embedded
            Operations Channel (EOC) as defined
            in American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
            T1E1.413/1995 <xref target="T1E1.413"/>
            and International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) G.992.1
            <xref target="G.992.1"/> and G.992.2 <xref
            target="G.992.2"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
            The MIB module described in RFC 4706 <xref
            target="RFC4706"/> is a wider management model that
            includes, in addition to ADSL technology, the ADSL2 and
            ADSL2+ technologies per G.992.3, G.992.4, and G.992.5 (<xref
            target="G.992.3"/>, <xref target="G.992.4"/>, and <xref
            target="G.992.5"/>, respectively).
        </t>
        <t>
            This document does not obsolete RFC 2662 <xref
            target="RFC2662"/>
            or RFC 4706 <xref target="RFC4706"/>, but rather provides a
            more comprehensive management model that addresses the VDSL2
            technology per G.993.2 (<xref target="G.993.2"/>) as well as
            ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2+ technologies.
        </t>
        <t>
            This document does not obsolete RFC 2662 <xref
            target="RFC2662"/>
            or RFC 4706 <xref target="RFC4706"/>.  RFC 2662 is relevant
            only for managing modems that do not support any DSL
            technology other than ADSL (e.g., G.992.1 <xref
            target="G.992.1"/> and G.992.2 <xref
            target="G.992.2"/>) especially if the modems were produced prior to
            approval of ITU-T G.997.1 standard revision 3 <xref
            target="G.997.1"/>.  RFC 4706 is more appropriate for
            managing modems that support ADSL2 technology variants (with
            or without being able to support the legacy ADSL).  This
            document supports all ADSL, ADSL2, and VDSL2 standards, but
            it assumes a more sophisticated management model, which
            older modems (even ADSL2 ones) may not be able to support.
            The selection of the appropriate MIB module for any DSL
            modem is based on the ifType value it reports, as explained
            in the next section.
        </t>
        <t>
            The management framework for VDSL2 lines <xref
            target="TR-129"/> specified
            by the Digital Subscriber Line Forum (DSLF) has been taken
            into consideration.
            That framework is based on the ITU-T G.997.1 standard <xref
            target="G.997.1"/> and its amendment 1 <xref
            target="G.997.1-Am1"/>.
         </t>
        <t>
            Note that the management model, according to this document,
            does not
            allow managing VDSL technology per G.993.1 <xref
            target="G.993.1"/>.  VDSL lines MUST be
            managed by RFC 3728 <xref target="RFC3728"/>.
         </t>
        <t>
            The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2
            transmission, as
            discussed in the MIB-2 Integration (RFC 2863 <xref
            target="RFC2863"/>)
            section of this document.

        <section title="Relationship to Other MIBs">
            <t>
                This section outlines the relationship of this MIB
                module with other
                MIB modules described in RFCs.  Specifically, IF-MIB as
                defined in
                RFC 2863 <xref target="RFC2863"/> and ENTITY-MIB as
                defined in RFC 4133 <xref target="RFC4133"/> are
                discussed.

                    The VDSL2 Line MIB specifies the detailed objects
                    of a data interface.  As such, it needs to integrate
                    with
                    RFC 2863 <xref target="RFC2863"/>.  The IANA has
                    assigned
                    the following ifTypes, which may be applicable for
                    VDSL2 lines
                    as well as for ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2+ lines:

                    In any case, the SNMP agent may use either
                    ifType=interleave(124) or fast(125) for each
                    channel,
                    e.g., depending on whether or not it is capable of
                    using an
                    interleaver on that channel.  It may use the
                    ifType=channel (70) when all channels are capable of
                    using

                    an interleaver (e.g., for ADSL2 xTUs).

                    Use of the ifStackTable to associate the entries for
                    physical, fast,
                    interleaved channels, and higher layers (e.g., ATM)
                    is shown below.
                    Use of the ifStackTable is necessary because
                    configuration
                    information is stored in profile tables associated
                    with the
                    physical-layer ifEntry only.  The channels' ifEntrys
                    need the
                    ifStackTable to find their associated physical-layer
                    entry and thus
                    their configuration parameters.

                    The following example shows the ifStackTable entries
                    for an
                    xDSL line with a single channel that uses an ATM

            4133)">
                <t>
                   Implementation of the Entity MIB <xref
                   target="RFC4133"/> is optional.  It in no way alters
                   the information required in the VDSL2 Line MIB, nor
                   does it alter the relationship with IF-MIB.
                </t>
                <t>
                   The Entity MIB introduces a standardized way of
                   presenting the components of complex systems, such as
                   a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM),
                   that may contain multiple racks, shelves, line cards,
                   and/or ports.  The Entity MIB's main goal is to
                   present these system components, their containment
                   relationship, and mapping information with other MIBs
                   such as the Interface MIB and the VDSL2 Line MIB.
                </t>
                <t>
                   The Entity MIB is capable of supporting the local DSL
                   termination unit.  Thus, assuming the SNMP agent is in
                   the DSLAM, the Entity MIB should include entities for
                   the xTU-C in the entPhysicalTable.  The MIB's
                   entAliasMappingTable would contain mapping
                   information identifying the 'ifIndex' object
                   associated with each xTU-C.  In case the SNMP agent
                   is actually in the Customer Premise Equipment (CPE), the Entity MIB should include
                   entities for the xTU-R in the entPhysicalTable.  In
                   this case, the MIB's entAliasMappingTable would
                   contain mapping information identifying the 'ifIndex'
                   object associated with each xTU-R.
                </t>
                <t>
                   Also associating the relationship between the ifTable
                   and Entity MIB, the entPhysicalTable contains an
                   'entPhysicalName' object, which approximates the
                   semantics of the 'ifName' object from the Interface
                   MIB.

                A new ifType value (251) for Very High Speed Digital
                Subscriber Loop Version 2 has been allocated for the
                VDSL2-LINE-MIB module, to distinguish
                between ADSL lines that are managed with the RFC 2662
                management
                model, ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ lines that are managed with
                the RFC 4706
                <xref target="RFC4706"/> management model, and
                VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2
                and ADSL2+ lines that are managed with the model defined
                in this document.
            </t>
            <t>
                Also, the VDSL2-LINE-MIB module has been assigned
                a single object identifier (251) for its MODULE-IDENTITY.  The IANA
                has allocated this object identifier in the transmission subtree.
            </t>
            <t>
                As performed in the past for the ADSL2-LINE-MIB module,
                the IANA has ensured that the allocated ifType value
                is the same as the allocated
                branch number in the transmission subtree.

                As a managed node can handle a large number of xTUs,
                (e.g., hundreds
                or perhaps thousands of lines), provisioning every
                parameter on every
                xTU may become burdensome.  Moreover, most lines are
                provisioned
                identically with the same set of parameters.  To
                simplify the
                provisioning process, this MIB module makes use of
                profiles and

                A configuration profile is a set of parameters that can
                be shared by
                multiple entities.  There is a configuration profile to
                address
                line-level provisioning and another type of profile that
                addresses
                channel-level provisioning parameters.

                A configuration template is actually a

                a template is comprised of one-line configuration
		profile and one or
                more channel configuration profiles.  A template
                provides the complete
                configuration of a line.  The same configuration can be
                shared by multiple
                lines.

                In a similar manner to the configuration profiles and
                templates,
                this MIB
                module makes use of templates and profiles for
                specifying the alarm
                thresholds associated with performance parameters.  This
                allows

                provisioning multiple lines with the same criteria for
                generating

                threshold crossing notifications.

                If the implementation allows modifying a profile or

                effect
                immediately.  These changes MAY result in a restart
                (hard reset or soft

                Network Elements MAY optionally implement a fallback
                line configuration template
                (see xdsl2LineConfFallbackTemplate).
                The fallback template will be tried if the xDSL2 line
                fails to operate using the primary template.
                If the xDSL2 line fails to operate using the fallback
                template, then the primary template should be retried.
                The xTU-C SHOULD continue to alternate between the
                primary and fallback templates until one of them
                succeeds.

        <section title="Managing Multiple Bearer Channels" >
            <t>
                The number of bearer channels is configured by setting
                the
                template objects xdsl2LConfTempChan1ConfProfile,
                xdsl2LConfTempChan2ConfProfile,
                xdsl2LConfTempChan3ConfProfile,
                and xdsl2LConfTempChan4ConfProfile and then assigning
                that
                template to a DSL line using the xdsl2LineConfTemplate
                object.  When the number of bearer channels for a DSL
                line changes, the SNMP agent will automatically create
                or
                destroy rows in channel-related tables associated with
                that
                line.  For example, when a DSL line is operating with one
                bearer channel, there will be zero rows in
                channel-related
                tables for channels two, three, and four.
                The SNMP agent MUST create and destroy channel-related

                The ability to generate the SNMP notifications
                coldStart/WarmStart
                (per <xref target="RFC3418"/>), which are per agent
                (e.g., per Digital
                Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer, or DSLAM, in such a
                device), and
                linkUp/linkDown (per <xref target="RFC2863"/>), which
                are per interface
                (i.e., VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 or ADSL2+ line) is required.
            </t>
            <t>
                A linkDown notification MAY be generated whenever any of
                ES, SES, CRC
                anomaly, LOS, LOF, or UAS events occur.  The
                corresponding linkUp
                notification MAY be sent when all link failure
                conditions are
                cleared.
            </t>
            <t>
                The notifications defined in this MIB module are for
                status change (e.g., initialization failure)
                and for the threshold crossings associated with the
                following events:
                full initialization failures, short initialization
                failures, ES, SES, LOS seconds, UAS, FEC seconds, FEC
                events, and
                CRC anomalies.
                Each threshold has its own enable/threshold value.  When
                that value is 0,
                the notification is disabled.
            </t>
            <t>
                The xdsl2LineStatusXtur and xdsl2LineStatusXtuc
                are bitmasks
                representing all outstanding error conditions associated
                with the xTU-R
                and xTU-C (respectively).  Note that since the xTU-R
                status is obtained via
                the EOC, this information may be unavailable in case the
                xTU-R is
                unreachable via EOC during a line error condition.
                Therefore, not
                all conditions may always be included in its current
                status.
                Notifications corresponding to the bit fields in those
                two status objects
                are defined.
            </t>
            <t>
                Note that there are other status parameters that refer
                to the xTU-R (e.g.,
                downstream line attenuation).  Those parameters also
                depend on the
                availability of EOC between the central office xTU and
                the remote xTU.
            </t>
            <t>
                A threshold notification occurs whenever the
                corresponding current
                15-minute interval error counter becomes equal to, or
                exceeds the
                threshold value.  Only one notification SHOULD be sent
                per interval per
                interface.  Since the current 15-minute counter is reset
                to 0 every
                15 minutes, and if the condition persists, the
                notification may recur
                as often as every 15 minutes.  For example, to get a
                notification
                whenever a &quot;loss of&quot; event occurs (but at most
                once every 15
                minutes), set the corresponding threshold to 1.  The
                agent will
                generate a notification when the event originally
                occurs.
            </t>
            <t>
                Note that the Network Management System, or NMS, may
                receive a
                linkDown notification, as well, if enabled (via
                ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable <xref target="RFC2863"/>).  At
                the beginning of
                the next 15-minute interval, the counter is reset.  When
                the first second
                goes by and the event occurs, the current interval
                bucket will be 1,
                which equals the threshold, and the notification will be
                sent again.

       In the case of ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+, those two transceivers are
       also called atuc and atur.
       In the case of VDSL2, those two transceivers are also called
       vtuc and vtur.
       Specified as an INTEGER, the two values are:
        xtuc(1)  -- central office transceiver
        xtur(2)  -- remote site transceiver&quot;
   SYNTAX      INTEGER {
                  xtuc(1),
                  xtur(2)
               }

Xdsl2Direction ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
     STATUS current
     DESCRIPTION
        &quot;Identifies the direction of a band in a VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2/
         ADSL2+ link.
         The upstream direction is a transmission from the remote end
         (xTU-R) towards the central office end (xTU-C).  The downstream
         direction is a transmission from the xTU-C towards the xTU-R.
         Specified as an INTEGER, the values are defined as
         follows:&quot;
     SYNTAX INTEGER {
        upstream(1),   -- Transmission from the xTU-R to the xTU-C.
        downstream(2)  -- Transmission from the xTU-C to the xTU-R.
            }

Xdsl2Band ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
     STATUS current
     DESCRIPTION
        &quot;Identifies a band in a VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2+ link.
         For a band in the upstream direction, transmission is from the
         remote end (xTU-R) towards the central office end (xTU-C).
         For a band in the downstream direction, transmission is from
         the xTU-C towards the xTU-R.
         For ADSL, ADSL2 and ADSL2+, which use a single band in the
         upstream direction and a single band
         in the downstream direction,
         the only relevant values are upstream(1) and downstream(2).
         For VDSL2, which uses multiple bands in each transmission
         direction, a band in the upstream direction is indicated by any
         of us0(3), us1(5), us2(7), us3(9), or us4(11), and a band in 
         the downstream direction is indicated by any of ds1(4), 
         ds2(6), ds3(8), or ds4(10).
         For VDSL2, the values upstream(1) and downstream(2) may be used
         when there is a need to refer to the whole upstream or
         downstream traffic (e.g., report the average signal-to-noise
         ratio on any transmission direction).
         Specified as an INTEGER, the values are defined as
         follows:&quot;
     SYNTAX INTEGER {
        upstream(1),   -- Transmission from the xTU-R to the xTU-C
                       -- (refers to the single upstream band for
                       -- ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2+ or to the whole
                       -- upstream traffic for VDSL2).
        downstream(2), -- Transmission from the xTU-C to the xTU-R
                       -- (refers to the single downstream band
                       -- for ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2+ or to the whole
                       -- downstream traffic for VDSL2).
        us0(3),        -- Upstream band number 0   (US0) (VDSL2).
        ds1(4),        -- Downstream band number 1 (DS1) (VDSL2).
        us1(5),        -- Upstream band number 1   (US1) (VDSL2).
        ds2(6),        -- Downstream band number 2 (DS2) (VDSL2).

   DESCRIPTION
        &quot;
         This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB)
         module for use with network management protocols in the
         Internet community for the purpose of managing VDSL2, ADSL,
         ADSL2, and ADSL2+ lines.

         The MIB module described in RFC 2662 [RFC2662] defines
         objects used for managing Asymmetric Bit-Rate DSL (ADSL)
         interfaces per [T1E1.413], [G.992.1], and [G.992.2].
         These object descriptions are based upon the specifications
         for the ADSL Embedded Operations Channel (EOC) as defined
         in American National Standards Institute (ANSI) T1E1.413
         [T1E1.413] and International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T)
         G.992.1 [G.992.1] and G.992.2 [G.992.2].

         The MIB module described in RFC 4706 [RFC4706] defines
         objects used for managing ADSL2 interfaces per [G.992.3]
         and [G.992.4], and ADSL2+ interfaces per [G.992.5].  That MIB
         is also capable of managing ADSL interfaces per [T1E1.413],
         [G.992.1], and [G.992.2].

         This document does not obsolete RFC 2662 [RFC2662] or
         RFC 4706 [RFC4706], but rather provides a more comprehensive
         management model that manages VDSL2 interfaces per G.993.2
         [G.993.2] as well as ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2+ technologies
         per T1E1.413, G.992.1, G.992.2, G.992.3, G.992.4, and
         G.992.5
         ([T1E1.413], [G.992.1], [G.992.2], [G.992.3], [G.992.4], and
         [G.992.5], respectively).

         Additionally, the management framework for VDSL2 lines
         specified by the Digital Subscriber Line Forum
         (DSLF) has been taken into consideration [TR-129].  That
         framework is based on the ITU-T G.997.1 standard [G.997.1] and
         its amendment 1 [G.997.1-Am1].

         The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2
         transmission, as discussed in the MIB-2 Integration (RFC 2863
         [RFC2863]) section of this document.

   STATUS      current
   DESCRIPTION
      &quot;This object is used to identify the template that will be
       used if the xDSL2 line fails to operate using the primary
       template.  The primary template is identified using the
       xdsl2LineConfTemplate object.

       For example, a xDSL2 line may fall back to a template with a 
       lower rate if the rate specified in the primary template 
       cannot be achieved.

       The value of this object identifies a row in the xDSL2 Line
       Configuration Template Table, xdsl2LineConfTemplateTable.
       Any row in the xdsl2LineConfTemplateTable table may be used as a
       fall-back template.

       If the xDSL2 line fails to operate using the fall-back template,
       then the primary template should be retried.
       The xTU-C should continue to alternate between the primary and
       fall-back templates until one of them succeeds.

       If the value of this object is a zero-length string, then no
       fall-back template is defined and only the primary template will
       be used.

       Note that implementation of this object is not mandatory.
       If this object is not supported, any attempt to modify this
       object should result in the SET request being rejected.

   DESCRIPTION
      &quot;Loop diagnostic state forced (LDSF).
       Defines whether the line should be forced into the loop
       diagnostics mode by the near-end xTU of this line.  Note that
       a loop diagnostic may be initiated by the far-end xTU at any
       time.

       Only when the xdsl2LineStatusPwrMngState object is in the
       'l3' state and the xdsl2LineCmndConfPmsf object is in the
       'l0orL2toL3' state, can the line be forced into loop diagnostic
       mode procedures.  Upon successful completion of the loop
       diagnostic mode procedures, the Access Node shall set this
       object to 'inhibit', and xdsl2LineStatusPwrMngState will
       remain in the 'l3' state.  The loop diagnostic data shall be
       available at least until xdsl2LineCmndConfPmsf is set to the
       'l3toL0' state.

       The results of the loop diagnostic procedure are stored in the
       tables xdsl2SCStatusTable, xdsl2SCStatusBandTable, and
       xdsl2SCStatusSegmentTable.  The status of the loop diagnostic
       procedure is indicated by xdsl2LineCmndConfLdsfFailReason.

       successfully, attempts shall be made to do so, until the loop
       diagnostic mode is no longer forced on the line through this
       configuration parameter.&quot;

   DESCRIPTION
      &quot;Request a bits-per-subcarrier measurement to be made.

       A request for a bits-per-subcarrier measurement is made by
       setting this object to the value of 'measure'.  Upon
       completion of the measurement request, the Access Node shall set
       this object to 'idle'.

       The SNMP agent should allow initiating a bits-per-subcarrier
       measurement process only if there is no other bits-per-subcarrier
       measurement already running, and respond with an SNMP error
       (e.g., wrongValue) otherwise.

       Note that a bits-per-subcarrier measurement is also performed
       during a line diagnostic procedure.  This object provides an
       additional mechanism to fetch the bits-per-subcarrier data.  This
       additional mechanism is provided so that bits-per-subcarrier
       data may be fetched without forcing the line into no power state.
       This is useful because the bits-per-subcarrier allocation may be
       adjusted at show time due to rate adaption and bit swapping.

       The implementation of this additional mechanism for measuring
       bits per subcarrier is not mandatory.

       The results of the bits-per-subcarrier measurement are stored in
       xdsl2LineSegmentTable.  The status of the bits-per-subcarrier
       measurement is indicated by
       xdsl2LineCmndConfBpscFailReason.&quot;

xdsl2LineCmndConfBpscRequests  OBJECT-TYPE
   SYNTAX      Counter32
   MAX-ACCESS  read-only
   STATUS      current
   DESCRIPTION
      &quot;Measurement request counter.
       This counter is incremented by one every time a request for a
       bits-per-subcarrier measurement is made.  A measurement request 
       is made by modifying the xdsl2LineCmndConfBpsc object from 
       idle(1) to the value measure(2).

       The measurement results may be very large and will not fit
       into a single PDU; hence, multiple SNMP GET requests may be
       required to fetch the measurement results.
       Because the measurement results cannot be fetched atomically,
       it is possible for a second manager to start a new measurement
       before a first manager has fetched all of its results.
       An SNMP manager can use this object to ensure that the
       measurement results retrieved using one or more GET requests
       all belong to the measurement initiated by that manager.

       The following steps are suggested in order for the SNMP
       manager to initiate the bits-per-subcarrier measurement:

       1. Wait for xdsl2LineCmndConfBpsc value to be idle(1).
       2. Perform an SNMP GET for xdsl2LineCmndConfBpscRequests.
       3. Wait a short delay (4 -> 8 seconds).
       4. Perform an SNMP SET on xdsl2LineCmndConfBpsc with
          the value measure(2).
       5. If step 4 returns an error, then go to step 1.
       6. Wait for xdsl2LineCmndConfBpsc value to be idle(1).
       7. Fetch measurement results using one or more GET PDUs.
       8. Perform an SNMP GET for xdsl2LineCmndConfBpscRequests.
       9. Compute the difference between the two values of
          xdsl2LineCmndConfBpscRequests.  If the value is one,
          then the results are valid, else go to step 1.&quot;

   DESCRIPTION
      &quot;Automode cold start forced.  This parameter is defined in
       order to improve testing of the performance of xTUs supporting
       automode when it is enabled in the MIB.
       Change the value of this parameter to 'true' to indicate a change
       in loop conditions applied to the devices under the test.  The 
       xTUs shall reset any historical information used for automode 
       and for shortening G.994.1 handshake and initialization.

       Automode is the case where multiple operation-modes are enabled
       through the xdsl2LConfProfXtuTransSysEna object in the line
       configuration profile being used for the line, and where the
       selection of the actual operation-mode depends not only on the
       common capabilities of both xTUs (as exchanged in G.994.1), but
       also on achievable data rates under given loop conditions.&quot;

          the line to reset (i.e., the modems will retrain).
          When the line has successfully reset, the SNMP agent will
          set the value of this object to 'idle'.

          Note that the xdsl2LineCmndConfPmsf object will always take
          precedence over this object.
          If the xdsl2LineCmndConfPmsf object is set to the value
          'l0orL2toL3', then the line MUST NOT return to the Showtime

xdsl2LineSegmentTable  OBJECT-TYPE

   STATUS      current
   DESCRIPTION
      &quot;The table xdsl2LineSegmentTable contains status parameters
       of VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ subcarriers.
       The parameters in this table are updated when a measurement
       request is made using the xdsl2LineCmndConfBpsc object.

       Note that a bits-per-subcarrier measurement is also performed
       during a line diagnostic procedure.  This table provides an
       additional mechanism to fetch the bits-per-subcarrier data.  This
       additional mechanism is provided so that bits-per-subcarrier
       data may be fetched without forcing the line into no power state.
       This is useful because the bits-per-subcarrier allocation may be
       adjusted at Showtime due to rate adaption and bit swapping.

       The implementation of this additional mechanism for measuring
       bits per subcarrier is not mandatory.&quot;

       of VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ subcarriers.

       Objects in the table refer to NSus and NSds.  For G.993.2, the
       value of NSus and NSds are, respectively, the indices of the
       highest supported upstream and downstream subcarriers according
       to the selected implementation profile.  For ADSL, NSus is equal
       to NSCus-1 and NSds is equal to NSCds-1.

       One index of this table is an interface index where the interface
       has an ifType of vdsl2(251).  A second index of this table is the
       transmission direction.  A third index identifies the specific

     DESCRIPTION
     &quot;The bits allocation per subcarrier.  An array of 256 octets
      (512 nibbles), designed for supporting up to 512 (downstream)
      subcarriers.  When more than 512 subcarriers are supported, the
      status information is reported through multiple (up to 8)
      segments.  The first segment is then used for the first 512
      subcarriers.  The second segment is used for the subcarriers 
      512 to 1023 and so on.
      The aggregate number of utilized nibbles in the downstream 
      direction (in all segments) depends on NSds; in the 
      upstream direction, it depends on NSus.
      This value is referred to here as NS.  The segment number is in
      xdsl2SCStatusSegment.
      Nibble i (0 &lt;= i &lt; MIN((NS+1)-(segment-1)*512,512)) in each
      segment is set to a value in the range 0 to 15 to indicate that
      the respective downstream or upstream subcarrier j
      (j=(segement-1)*512+i) has the same amount of bits
      allocation.&quot;

     &quot;Row Status.  The SNMP agent will create a row in this table
      for storing the results of a measurement performed on the
      associated line, if the row does not already exist.

      The SNMP manager is not permitted to create rows in this table or
      set the row status to &apos;notInService&apos;.  In the first case,
      if the SNMP manager tries to create a new row, the SNMP agent
      responds with the value &apos;noCreation&apos; in the error status
      field of the response-PDU.  In the latter case, the SNMP agent
      responds with the value &apos;wrongValue&apos; in the error status
      field of the response-PDU.

      The SNMP agent may have limited resources; therefore, if multiple
      rows coexist in this table, it may fail to add new rows to this
      table or allocate memory resources.
      If that occurs, the SNMP agent responds with the value
      &apos;noResources&apos; (for the xdsl2LineCmndConfBpscFailReason
      object in xdsl2LineTable).

      The management system (the operator) may delete rows from this
      table according to any scheme.  For example, after retrieving 
      the results.

      When the SNMP manager deletes any row in this table, the SNMP
      agent MUST delete all rows in this table that have the same
      ifIndex value.&quot;

     DESCRIPTION
     &quot;Row Status.  The SNMP agent will create a row in this table
      for storing the results of a DELT performed on the associated
      line, if the row does not already exist.

      When a row is created in this table, the SNMP agent should also
      create corresponding rows in the tables xdsl2SCStatusBandTable and
      xdsl2SCStatusSegmentTable.

      The SNMP manager is not permitted to create rows in this table or
      set the row status to &apos;notInService&apos;.  In the first case,
      if the SNMP manager tries to create a new row, the SNMP agent
      responds with the value &apos;noCreation&apos; in the error status
      field of the response-PDU.  In the latter case the SNMP agent
      responds with the value &apos;wrongValue&apos; in the error status
      field of the response-PDU.

      When a row is deleted in this table, the SNMP agent should also
      delete corresponding rows in the tables xdsl2SCStatusBandTable and
      xdsl2SCStatusSegmentTable.

      The SNMP agent may have limited resources; therefore, if multiple
      rows coexist in this table, it may fail to add new rows to this
      table or allocate memory resources for a new DELT process.  If
      that occurs, the SNMP agent responds with either the value
      &apos;tableFull&apos; or the value &apos;noResources&apos; (for
      the xdsl2LineCmndConfLdsfFailReason object in xdsl2LineTable).

      The management system (the operator) may delete rows from this
      table according to any scheme.  For example, after retrieving the
      results.&quot;

   DESCRIPTION
      &quot;The table xdsl2LineConfTemplateTable contains VDSL2/ADSL/
       ADSL2 and ADSL2+ line configuration templates.

       Note that this table is also used to configure the number of
       bearer channels.
       When the number of bearer channels is increased, the SNMP agent
       SHOULD create rows in all tables indexed by a channel index.  
       When the number of bearer channels is decreased, the SNMP agent 
       SHOULD delete rows in all tables indexed by a channel index.
       For example, if the value of xdsl2LConfTempChan4ConfProfile is
       set to a non-null value, then rows SHOULD be created in
       xdsl2ChannelStatusTable, xdsl2PMChCurrTable, and all other tables
       indexed by a channel index.
       For example, if the value of xdsl2LConfTempChan2ConfProfile is
       set to a null value, then rows SHOULD be deleted in
       xdsl2ChannelStatusTable, xdsl2PMChCurrTable, and all other

      &quot;VDSL2-specific subcarrier mask.  This configuration
       parameter defines the restrictions, additional to the band plan,
       to determine the set of subcarriers allowed for transmission in
       both the upstream and downstream directions.
       The parameter shall describe the not masked subcarriers as one or
       more frequency bands.  Each band is represented by start and stop
       subcarrier indices with a subcarrier spacing of 4.3125 kHz.  The
       valid range of subcarrier indices runs from 0 to at least the
       index of the highest allowed subcarrier in both transmission
       directions among all profiles enabled by the parameter
       xdsl2LConfProfProfiles.
       Up to 32 bands may be specified.  Other subcarriers shall be
       masked.&quot;

   DESCRIPTION
      &quot;For ITU-T Recommendation G.992.5, this configuration 
       parameter defines
       the subset of downstream PSD mask breakpoints, as specified in
       xdsl2LConfProfPsdMaskDs (PSDMASKds), that shall be used to notch
       an RFI band.  This subset consists of pairs of consecutive
       subcarrier indices belonging to breakpoints: [ti; ti + 1],
       corresponding to the low level of the notch.
       The specific interpolation around these points is defined in the
       relevant Recommendations (e.g., ITU-T Recommendation G.992.5).
       The CO-MIB shall define the RFI notches using breakpoints in
       xdsl2LConfProfPsdMaskDs (PSDMASKds) as specified in the relevant
       Recommendations (e.g., ITU-T Recommendation G.992.5).

       For ITU-T Recommendation G.993.2, this configuration parameter 
       defines the bands where the PSD shall be reduced as
       specified in #7.2.1.2/G.993.2.  Each band shall be represented 
       by a start and stop subcarrier indices with a subcarrier 
       spacing of 4.3125 kHz.  Up to 16 bands may be specified. 
       This parameter defines the RFI bands for both the upstream 
       and downstream directions.&quot;
