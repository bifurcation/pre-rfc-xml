<abstract>
<t>
A stateless IPv4/IPv6 translator may receive ICMPv6 packets containing
non-IPv4-translatable addresses as the source. These packets should be passed 
across the translator as ICMP packets directed to the IPv4 destination.  This
document presents recommendations for source address translation in ICMPv6
headers to handle such cases. 
</t>

<section title="Introduction">

<t>
Section 5.3 of "IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm" <xref target="RFC6145"></xref> 
states that "the IPv6 addresses in the IPv6 header may not be IPv4-translatable
addresses and there will be no corresponding IPv4 addresses
   representing this IPv6 address.  In this case, the translator can do
   stateful translation.  A mechanism by which the translator can
   instead do stateless translation of this address is left for future
   work." This document, "Stateless Source Address Mapping for ICMPv6 Packets",
provides recommendations for this case.

<section title="Notational Conventions">
<t>The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, 
SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and 
OPTIONAL, when they appear in this document, 
are to be interpreted as described in 
<xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Problem Statement and Considerations">
<t>
   When a stateless IPv4/IPv6 translator receives an ICMPv6 message 
<xref target="RFC4443"></xref>
(for
   example, "Packet Too Big") sourced from a non-IPv4-translatable IPv6
   address and bound for an IPv4-translatable IPv6 address, the translator needs to
   pick a source address with which to generate an ICMP message.  For the reasons discussed below, this choice
   is problematic.
</t>

<section title="Considerations">

<t>
The source address used SHOULD NOT cause the ICMP packet to be discarded. It
SHOULD NOT be drawn from  
<xref target="RFC1918"/> or <xref target="RFC6598"/> address space, because 
that address space is likely to be subject to unicast
Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF)
<xref target="RFC3704"/> 
filtering.
</t>


<t>
IPv4/IPv6 translation is intended for use in contexts where IPv4 addresses may
not be readily available.  Therefore, it is not considered appropriate to assign IPv4-translatable IPv6
addresses for all internal points in the IPv6 network that may originate
ICMPv6 messages.
</t>

<t>
Another consideration for source selection is that it should be possible for the IPv4 recipients of
the ICMP message to be able to distinguish between different IPv6 network origination of ICMPv6
messages (for example, to support a traceroute diagnostic utility
that provides some limited network-level visibility across the IPv4/IPv6
translator). This consideration implies that an IPv4/IPv6 translator needs to have a
pool of IPv4 addresses for mapping the source address of
ICMPv6 packets generated from different origins, or to include the IPv6 source address information for mapping the source address by others means. 
Currently, the TRACEROUTE and MTR <xref target="MTR"/> are the only consumers of
translated ICMPv6 messages that care about the ICMPv6 source address.
</t> 

</section>
<section title="Recommendations">
<t>
The recommended approach to source selection is to use a single (or small pool
of) public IPv4 address as the source address of the translated ICMP message
and leverage the ICMP extension  <xref target="RFC5837"/> to include the IPv6 address as an Interface IP Address Sub-Object.
</t>
</section>
</section>


<section title="ICMP Extension">
<t>
   In the case of either a single public IPv4 address (the IPv4 interface address or loopback address of the translator)      
    or a pool of public IPv4 addresses, the translator SHOULD implement the ICMP extension defined by <xref target="RFC5837"/>. 
   The ICMP message SHOULD
   include the Interface IP Address Sub-Object and specify the source IPv6
   addresses of the original ICMPv6. When an enhanced traceroute
   application is used, it can derive the real IPv6 source addresses that generated the
   ICMPv6 messages. Therefore, it would be able improve on visibility towards the origin rather than simply blackholing at or beyond the translator.

   In the future, a new ICMP extension whose presence 
   indicates that the packet has been translated and that the source 
   address belongs to the translator, not the originating node, can also 
   be considered.
</t>
</section>


<section title="Stateless Address Mapping Algorithm">

<t>
   If a pool of public IPv4 addresses is configured on the translator,
   it is RECOMMENDED to randomly select the IPv4 source address from the
   pool.  Random selection reduces the probability that two ICMP
   messages elicited by the same TRACEROUTE might specify the same
   source address and, therefore, erroneously present the appearance of
   a routing loop.  
</t>
<t>
 <xref target="RFC5837"/> 
extensions and an enhanced traceroute application, if used, will
   reveal the IPv6 source addresses that generated the original ICMPv6 messages.

</t>

</section>



<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
This document recommends the generation of IPv4 ICMP messages from IPv6 ICMP
messages. These messages would otherwise have been discarded. New
considerations are not expected to result from this change. As with a number of ICMP messages, a spoofed source address may result in replies arriving at hosts that did not expect them using the facility of the translator.</t>
