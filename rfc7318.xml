<t>
This document introduces policy qualifiers in the certificate policies
extension of the RPKI resource certificates.  This document updates <xref
target="RFC6487" />.

                The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
                "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
                document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.

        </section>
        <section title="Update to RFC 6487" anchor="update_6487">
            <t>
                <xref target="RFC6487"></xref> profiles certificates, certificate revocation lists,
                and certificate signing requests specified in <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> for use
                in routing public key infrastructure.
            </t>
            <t>
                <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> defines an extension to certificates for the listing
                of policy information (see Section 4.2.1.4). <xref target="RFC6487"></xref> states in
                Section 4.8.9: "This extension MUST be present and MUST be marked critical.  It MUST
                include exactly one policy, as specified in the RPKI CP <xref target="RFC6484"></xref>".
                This references the CertPolicyId of the sequence allowed in PolicyInformation as
                defined by <xref target="RFC5280"></xref>.
            </t>
            <t>
                <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> also specifies that PolicyInformation may optionally
                have a sequence of PolicyQualifierInfo objects. <xref target="RFC6487"></xref> does
                not specifically allow or disallow these PolicyQualifierInfo
		objects, although Section 4 also states: "Unless specifically noted as being OPTIONAL, all the fields 
                listed here MUST be present, and any other fields MUST NOT appear in a conforming resource 
                certificate."
            </t>
            <t>
                Because there is a need for some RPKI Certificate Authorities to include
                policy qualifiers in their certificates, this document updates
		Section 4.8.9 of 
		<xref target="RFC6487"></xref> as follows:

                  <t>OLD:

                              MUST include exactly one policy, as specified in the RPKI Certificate Policy (CP)

                        <t>This extension MUST be present and MUST be marked critical.  It
                MUST include exactly one policy, as specified in the RPKI CP
                <xref target="RFC6484"></xref>.  Exactly one policy qualifier MAY be included.  If a
                policy qualifier is included, the policyQualifierId MUST be the
                Certification Practice Statement (CPS) pointer qualifier type (id-qt-cps).</t>

                  </t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                As noted in <xref target="RFC5280"></xref>, Section 4.2.1.4: "Optional qualifiers, which
                MAY be present, are not expected to change the definition of the
                policy." In this case, any optional policy qualifier that MAY  be present
                in a resource certificate MUST NOT change the definition of the 
                RPKI CP <xref target="RFC6484"></xref>.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
                The Security Considerations of <xref target="RFC6487"></xref> apply to this document.
            </t>
            <t>
                This document updates the RPKI certificate profile to specify that the
                certificate policies extension can include a policy qualifier, which is
                a URI.  While dereferencing the URI is
                not required for certificate validation, doing so could provide a
                denial-of-service (DoS) vector, where the target host may be
                subjected to bogus work dereferencing the URI.
                However, this specification, like <xref target="RFC5280"></xref>, places no processing
                requirements on the URI included in the qualifier.
            </t>
            <t>
                As an update to <xref target="RFC6487"></xref>, this document broadens the class of certificates that 
                conform to the RPKI profile by explicitly including within the profile those certificates 
                that contain a policy qualifier as described here. A relying party that performs a strict 
                validation based on <xref target="RFC6487"></xref> and fails to support the updates described in this document 
                would incorrectly invalidate RPKI objects that include the changes in <xref target="update_6487"></xref>.
            </t>

        <section title="Acknowledgments">
            <t>
                Frank Hill and Adam Guyot helped define the scope of the issue
		covered by this document and identified and
                worked with RPKI validator implementers to clarify the use of policy qualifiers
                in resource certificates.

                Sean Turner provided significant text to this document regarding the processing of
                the CPS URI and limiting the scope of the allowable content of the policy qualifier.
