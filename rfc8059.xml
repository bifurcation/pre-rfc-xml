      <t>This document defines two PIM Join/Prune attributes that support the
construction of multicast distribution trees where the root and receivers are
located in different Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) sites. These attributes allow the receiver site to
select between unicast and multicast underlying transport and to convey the
RLOC (Routing Locator) address of the receiver ETR (Egress Tunnel Router)
to the control plane of the root ITR (Ingress Tunnel Router).</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>The construction of multicast distribution trees where the root and
receivers are located in different LISP sites <xref target="RFC6830"/> is
defined in <xref target="RFC6831"/>. Creation of (root-EID,G) state in the
root site requires that unicast LISP-encapsulated Join/Prune messages be sent
from an ETR on the receiver site to an ITR on the root site. The term "EID" is
short for "Endpoint ID".</t> 

      <t><xref target="RFC6831"/> specifies that (root-EID,G) data packets are to be LISP-encapsulated into (root-RLOC,G) multicast packets. However, a wide deployment of multicast connectivity between LISP sites is unlikely to happen any time soon. In fact, some implementations are initially focusing on unicast transport with head-end replication between root and receiver sites.</t>

      <t>The unicast LISP-encapsulated Join/Prune message specifies the (root&nbhy;EID,G) state that needs to be established in the root site, but conveys nothing about the receiver's capability or desire to use multicast as the underlying transport. This document specifies a Join/Prune attribute that allows the receiver ETR to select the desired transport.</t>
     
      <t>The term "transport" in this document is intentionally somewhat vague.
Currently, it is used just to indicate whether multicast or head-end replication
is used; this means that the outer destination address is either a unicast
or multicast address. 
Future documents may specify how other types of delivery,
encapsulation, or underlay are used.</t>

      <t>Knowledge of the receiver ETR's RLOC address is essential to the
control plane of the root ITR.  The RLOC address determines the downstream
destination for unicast head-end replication and identifies the receiver ETR
that needs to be notified should the root ITR of the distribution tree move
to another site. The root ITR can change when the source EID is roaming to
another LISP site.</t>
 
      <t>Service providers may implement unicast reverse path forwarding (uRPF) policies requiring that the outer source address of the LISP-encapsulated Join/Prune message be the address of the receiver ETR's core-facing interface used to physically transmit the message. However, due to policy and load-balancing considerations, the outer source address may not be the RLOC on which the receiver site wishes to receive a particular flow. This document specifies a Join/Prune attribute that conveys the appropriate receiver ETR's RLOC address to the control plane of the root ITR.</t>

      <t>This document uses terminology defined in <xref target="RFC6830"/>,
such as EID, RLOC, ITR, and ETR.</t>

    <section title="Requirements Notation">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>
    
    
    <section title="PIM Join/Prune Attributes">
    
      <t>PIM Join/Prune attributes are defined in <xref target="RFC5384"/> by introducing a new Encoded-Source type that, in addition to the Join/Prune source, can carry multiple Type-Length-Value (TLV) attributes. These attributes apply to the individual Join/Prune sources on which they are stored.</t>
    
      <t>The attributes defined in this document conform to the format of the encoding type defined in <xref target="RFC5384"/>. The attributes would typically be the same for all the sources in the Join/Prune message. Hence, we RECOMMEND using the hierarchical Join/Prune attribute scheme defined in <xref target="RFC7887"/>. This hierarchical system allows attributes to be conveyed in the Upstream Neighbor Address field, thus enabling the efficient application of a single attribute instance to all the sources in the Join/Prune message.</t>
      
      <t>LISP Tunnel Routers (xTRs) do not exchange PIM Hello Messages, and hence no Hello option is defined to negotiate support for these attributes. Systems that support unicast head-end replication are assumed to support these attributes.</t>

    </section>

    
    <section title="The Transport Attribute">
      <t>It is essential that a mechanism be provided by which the desired transport can be conveyed by receiver sites. Root sites with multicast connectivity will want to leverage multicast replication. However, not all receiver sites can be expected to have multicast connectivity. It is thus desirable that root sites be prepared to support (root-EID,G) state with a mixture of multicast and unicast output state. This document specifies a Join/Prune attribute that allows the receiver to select the desired underlying transport.</t>

        <t>Hierarchical Join/Prune attribute instances <xref target="RFC7887"/> SHOULD be used when the same Transport Attribute is to be applied to all the sources within the Join/Prune message or all the sources within a group set.

        <t>There MUST NOT be more than one Transport Attribute within the same encoded address. If an encoded address has more than one instance of the attribute, the root ITR MUST discard all affected Join/Prune sources. The root ITR
MUST also discard all affected Join/Prune sources if the Transport Attribute
value is unknown.</t>
        
      </section>
      
    </section>
    
    <section title="Receiver ETR RLOC Attribute">

      <t>When a receiver ETR requests unicast head-end replication for a given (root-EID,G) entry, the PIM control plane of the root ITR must maintain an outgoing interface list ("oif-list") entry for the receiver ETR and its corresponding RLOC address. This allows the root ITR to perform unicast LISP-encapsulation of multicast data packets to each and every receiver ETR that has requested unicast head-end replication.</t>
      
      <t>The PIM control plane of the root ITR could potentially determine the
      RLOC address of the receiver ETR from the outer source address field of
      the LISP-encapsulated Join/Prune message. However, receiver ETRs are subject to uRPF checks by the network providers on each core-facing interface. The outer source address must therefore be the RLOC of the core-facing interface used to physically transmit the LISP-encapsulated Join/Prune message. Due to policy and load-balancing considerations, that may not be the RLOC on which the receiver site wishes to receive a particular flow. This document specifies a Join/Prune attribute that conveys the appropriate receiver RLOC address to the PIM control plane of the root ITR.</t> 
      
      <t>To support root-EID mobility, receiver ETRs must also be tracked by
      the LISP control plane of the root ITR, regardless of the underlying
      transport. When the root-EID moves to a new root ITR in a different LISP
      site, the receiver ETRs do not know the root-EID has moved and therefore
      do not know the RLOC of the new root ITR. This is true for both unicast
      and multicast transport modes. The new root ITR does not have any
      receiver ETR state. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the old root
      ITR to inform the receiver ETRs that the root-EID has moved. When the
      old root ITR detects that the root-EID has moved, it sends a LISP
      Solicit-Map-Request (SMR) message to each receiver ETR. The receiver ETRs do a mapping database lookup to retrieve the RLOC of the new root ITR. The old root ITR detects that the root-EID has moved when it receives a Map-Notify from the Map-Server. The transmission of the Map-Notify is triggered when the new root ITR registers the root-EID <xref target="EID-MOBILITY"/>. When a receiver ETR determines that the root ITR has changed, it will send a LISP-encapsulated PIM prune message to the old root xTR and a LISP-encapsulated PIM join message to the new root xTR.</t>
