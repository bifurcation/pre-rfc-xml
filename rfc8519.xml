    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a data model for Access Control Lists (ACLs). An
      ACL is a user-ordered set of rules used to configure the forwarding
      behavior in a device. Each rule is used to find a match on a packet and
      define actions that will be performed on the packet.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>An Access Control List (ACL) is one of the basic elements used to
      configure device-forwarding behavior. It is used in many networking
      technologies such as Policy-Based Routing (PBR), firewalls, etc.</t>

      <t>An ACL is a user-ordered set of rules that is used to filter
      traffic on a networking device. Each rule is represented by an Access
      Control Entry (ACE).</t>

      <t>Each ACE has a group of match criteria and a group of actions.</t>

      <t>The match criteria allow for the definition of packet headers and
      metadata, the contents of which must match the definitions.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Packet header matches apply to fields visible in the packet such
          as address, Class of Service (CoS), or port number.</t>

          <t>In case a vendor supports it, metadata matches apply to fields
          associated with the packet, that are not in the packet header, such as
          the input interface or length of the packet as received over the
          wire.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The actions specify what to do with the packet when the matching
      criteria are met. These actions are any operations that would apply to
      the packet, such as counting, policing, or simply forwarding. The list
      of potential actions is unbounded depending on the capabilities of the
      networking devices.</t>

      <t>Access Control List is also widely known as ACL (pronounced as [ak&nbhy;uh&nbsp;l]) or Access List. In this document, Access Control List, ACL, and
      Access List are used interchangeably.</t>

      <t>The matching of filters and actions in an ACE/ACL is triggered only
      after the application/attachment of the ACL to an interface, a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) interface,
      a vty/tty session, a QoS policy, or routing protocols, amongst various other
      configuration attachment points. Once attached, it is used for filtering
      traffic using the match criteria in the ACEs and taking appropriate
      action(s) that has been configured against that ACE. In order to apply
      an ACL to any attachment point other than an interface, vendors would
      have to augment the ACL YANG model.</t>

    <section anchor="problem" title="Problem Statement">
      <t>This document defines a YANG 1.1 data
      model <xref target="RFC7950"/> for the configuration of ACLs. The model defines matching rules
      for commonly used protocols such as Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6, TCP, UDP, and
      ICMP. If more protocols need to be supported in the future, this base
      model can be augmented. An example of such an augmentation can be seen
      in <xref target="app-additional"/>.</t>

      <t>ACL implementations in every device may vary greatly in terms of the
      filter constructs and actions that they support. Therefore, this document
      proposes a model that can be augmented by standard extensions and vendor
      proprietary models.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="design" title="Understanding ACL's Filters and Actions">
      <t>Although different vendors have different ACL data models, there is a
      common understanding of what an ACL is. A network
      system usually has a list of ACLs, and each ACL contains an ordered list
      of rules, also known as ACEs. Each ACE has a
      group of match criteria and a group of actions. The match criteria allows
      for definition of the contents of the packet headers or metadata, if
      supported by the vendor. Packet header matching applies to fields
      visible in the packet such as address, CoS, or port number. Metadata
      matching applies to fields associated with the packet, that are not in the
      packet header, such as the input interface, packet length, or source or
      destination prefix length. The actions can be any sort of operation from
      logging to rate-limiting or dropping to simply forwarding. Actions on
      the first matching ACE are applied with no processing of subsequent
      ACEs.</t>

      <t>The model also includes a container to hold overall operational state
      for each ACL and for each ACE. One ACL can be applied
      to multiple targets within the device, such as the interface of a networking
      device, applications or features running in the device, etc. When
      applied to interfaces of a networked device, distinct ACLs are defined
      for the ingress (input) or egress (output) interface.</t>

      <t>This document tries to address the commonalities between all vendors and
      creates a common model, which can be augmented with proprietary models.
      The base model is simple in design, and we hope to achieve enough
      flexibility for each vendor to extend the base model.</t>

      <t>The use of feature statements in the model allows vendors to
      advertise match rules they are capable and willing to support. There are
      two sets of feature statements a device needs to advertise. The first
      set of feature statements specifies the capability of the device. These
      include features such as "Device can support matching on Ethernet
      headers" or "Device can support matching on IPv4 headers". The second
      set of feature statements specifies the combinations of headers the device
      is willing to support. These include features such as "Plain IPv6 ACL
      supported" or "Ethernet, IPv4 and IPv6 ACL combinations supported".</t>

      <section anchor="aclmodules" title="ACL Modules">
        <t>There are two YANG modules in the model. The first module,
        "ietf-access-control-list", defines generic ACL aspects that are
        common to all ACLs regardless of their type or vendor. In effect, the
        module can be viewed as providing a generic ACL "superclass". It
        imports the second module, "ietf-packet-fields". The match container
        in "ietf-access-control-list" uses groupings in "ietf-packet-fields"
        to specify match fields such as port numbers or protocols. The
        combination of 'if-feature' checks and 'must' statements allows for the
        selection of relevant match fields that a user can define rules
        for.</t>

        <t>If there is a need to define a new "matches" choice, such as <xref
        target="RFC7011">IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)</xref>, the container "matches" can be
        augmented.</t>

      <section anchor="ietfacl" title="IETF Access Control List Module">
        <t>The "ietf-access-control-list" module defines the "acls" container that
        has a list of each "acl". Each "acl" has information identifying the access
        list by a name ("name") and a list ("aces") of rules associated with
        the "name". Each of the entries in the list ("aces"), indexed by the
        string "name", has containers defining "matches" and "actions".</t>

        <t>The model defines several ACL types and actions in the form of
        identities and features. Features are used by implementors to select
        the ACL types the system can support, and identities are used to
        validate the types that have been selected. These types are implicitly
        inherited by the "ace", thus safeguarding against misconfiguration of
        "ace" types in an "acl".</t>

        <t>The "matches" define criteria used to identify patterns in
        "ietf-packet-fields". The choice statements within the match container
        allow for the selection of one header within each of "l2", "l3", or "l4"
        headers. The "actions" define the behavior to undertake once a "match" has
        been identified. In addition to permit and deny actions, a logging
        option allows for a match to be logged that can later be used to
        determine which rule was matched upon. The model also defines the
        ability for ACLs to be attached to a particular interface.</t>

        <t>Statistics in the ACL can be collected for an "ace" or for an
        "interface". The feature statements defined for statistics can be used
        to determine whether statistics are being collected per "ace" or per
        "interface".</t>

        <t>This module imports definitions from <xref target="RFC6991">"Common
        YANG Data Types"</xref> and <xref target="RFC8343">"A YANG Data Model
        for Interface Management"</xref>.</t>

        <t>The packet fields module defines the necessary groups for matching
        on fields in the packet including Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6, and transport-layer
        fields. The "type" node determines which of these fields get
        included for any given ACL with the exception of TCP, UDP, and ICMP
        header fields. Those fields can be used in conjunction with any of the
        above Layer 2 or Layer 3 fields.</t>

        <t>Since the number of match criteria are very large, the base specification
        does not include these directly but references them by the 'uses'
        statement to keep the base module simple. In case more match
        conditions are needed, those can be added by augmenting choices within
        container "matches" in the ietf-access-control-list.yang data model.</t>

      <section anchor="newcoacl" title="Example of a Company's Proprietary Module">
        <t>The "example-newco-acl" module is an example of a company's proprietary
        model that augments the "ietf-acl" module. It shows how to use 'augment'
        with an XML Path Language (XPath) expression to add additional match criteria, actions,
        and default actions for when no ACE matches are found. All these are
        company proprietary extensions or system feature extensions.
        "example-newco-acl" is just an example, and it is expected that vendors
        will create their own proprietary models.</t>

      <section title="Linux nftables">
        <t>As the Linux platform is becoming more popular than the networking platform,
        the Linux data model is changing. Previously, ACLs in Linux were highly
        protocol specific, and different utilities were used (iptables,
        ip6tables, arptables, and ebtables), so each one had a separate data model.
        Recently, this has changed, and a single utility, nftables, has been
        developed.
         With a single application, it has a single data model for
        firewall filters, and it follows very similarly the
        ietf-access-control list module proposed in this document. The nftables
        support input and output ACEs, and each ACE can be defined with match
        and action.</t>

        <t>The example in <xref target="example"/> can be configured using
        nftable tool as below.</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
      nft add table ip filter
      nft add chain filter input
      nft add rule ip filter input ip protocol tcp ip saddr \
          192.0.2.1/24 drop
      ]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>The configuration entries added in nftable would be:</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
      table ip filter {
        chain input {
          ip protocol tcp ip saddr 192.0.2.1/24 drop
        }
      }

]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>We can see that there are many similarities between Linux nftables
        and IETF ACL YANG data models and their extension models. It should be
        fairly easy to do translation between the ACL YANG model described in this
        document and Linux nftables.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Ethertypes">
        <t>The ACL module is dependent on the definition of Ethertypes. IEEE
        owns the allocation of those Ethertypes. This model is being included
        here to enable the definition of those types till such time that IEEE
        takes up the task of publication of the model that defines those
        Ethertypes. At that time, this model can be deprecated.</t>

 <section anchor="ack" title="Acknowledgements" numbered='no'>
      <t>Alex Clemm, Andy Bierman, and Lisa Huang started by sketching
      an initial draft version in several past IETF meetings. That document included
      an ACL YANG model structure and a rich set of match filters, and it
      acknowledged contributions by Louis Fourie, Dana Blair, Tula Kraiser,
      Patrick Gili, George Serpa, Martin Bjorklund, Kent Watsen, and Phil
      Shafer. Many people have reviewed the various earlier draft versions that made
      the document that went into IETF charter.</t>

      <t>Dean Bogdanovic, Kiran Agrahara Sreenivasa, Lisa Huang, and Dana
      Blair each evaluated the YANG model in earlier draft versions separately, and
      then they worked together to create an ACL draft version that was supported by
      different vendors. That document removed vendor-specific features and gave
      examples that allowed vendors to extend their own proprietary ACLs. That
      earlier draft version was superseded with this document and received
      participation from many vendors.</t>

      <t>The authors would like to thank Jason Sterne, Lada Lhotka, Juergen
      Schoenwalder, David Bannister, Jeff Haas, Kristian Larsson, and Einar
      Nilsen-Nygaard for their reviews of and suggestions for the document.</t>
