   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>In the context of MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP, see <xref
     target="MPLS-TP"></xref> and <xref target="RFC5654"></xref>), the
     rationales for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) are
     twofold as it can serve:</t>

     <t><list style="symbols">
         <t>as a network-oriented functionality, used by a transport network
         operator to monitor his network infrastructure and to implement
         internal mechanisms in order to enhance the general behavior and the
         level of performance of his network (e.g., protection mechanism in
         case of node or link failure). As an example, fault localization is
         typically associated with this use case.</t>

         <t>as a service-oriented functionality, used by a transport service
         provider to monitor services offered to end customers in order to be
         able to react rapidly in case of a problem and to be able to verify
         some of the Service Level Agreement (SLA) parameters (e.g., using
         performance monitoring) negotiated with the end customers. Note that
         a transport service could be provided over several networks or
         administrative domains that may not all be owned and managed by the
         same transport service provider.</t>
       </list></t>

     <t>More generally, OAM is an important and fundamental functionality in
     transport networks as it contributes to:</t>

     <t><list style="symbols">
         <t>the reduction of operational complexity and costs, by allowing
         for efficient and automatic detection, localization, and handling
         and diagnosis of defects, as well as by minimizing service
         interruptions and operational repair times.</t>

         <t>the enhancement of network availability, by ensuring that defects
         (for example, those resulting in misdirected customer traffic) and
         faults are detected, diagnosed, and dealt with before a customer
         reports the problem.</t>

         <t>meeting service and performance objectives, as the OAM
         functionality allows for SLA verification in a multi-maintenance
         domain environment and allows for the determination of service
         degradation due, for example, to packet delay or packet loss.</t>
       </list></t>

     <section title="Scope of This Document">
       <t>This document lists architectural and functional requirements for
       the OAM functionality of MPLS-TP. These requirements apply to
       pseudowires (PWs), Label Switched Paths (LSPs), and Sections.</t>

       <t>These requirements are derived from the set of requirements
       specified by ITU-T and published in the ITU-T Supplement Y.Sup4 <xref
       target="Y.Sup4"></xref>.</t>

       <t>By covering transport specificities, these requirements complement
       those identified in RFC 4377 <xref target="RFC4377"></xref>; yet, some
       requirements may be similar.</t>

       <t>This document only lists architectural and functional OAM
       requirements. It does not detail the implications of their
       applicability to the various types (e.g., point-to-point,
       point-to-multipoint, unidirectional, bidirectional, etc.) of PWs,
       LSPs, and Sections. Furthermore, this document does not provide
       requirements on how the protocol solution(s) should behave to achieve
       the functional objectives. Please see <xref
       target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework"></xref> for further
       information.</t>

       <t>Note that the OAM functions identified in this document may be used
       for fault-management, performance-monitoring, and/or
       protection-switching applications. For example, connectivity
       verification can be used for fault management by detecting failure
       conditions, but may also be used for performance monitoring through
       its contribution to the evaluation of performance metrics (e.g.,
       unavailability time). Nevertheless, it is outside the scope of this
       document to specify which function should be used for which
       application.</t>

       <t>Note also that it is anticipated that implementers may wish to
       implement OAM message handling in hardware. Although not a
       requirement, this fact could be taken as a design consideration.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="Requirements Language and Terminology">
       <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
       "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
       document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref
       target="RFC2119" />. Although this document is not a protocol
       specification, the use of this language clarifies the instructions to
       protocol designers producing solutions that satisfy the requirements
       set out in this document.</t>

       <t>In this document, we:</t>

       <list style="symbols">
         <t>refer to the inability of a function to perform a required action
         as a fault. This does not include an inability due to preventive
         maintenance, lack of external resources, or planned actions. See
         also ITU-T G.806 <xref target="G.806" />.</t>

         <t>refer to the situation in which the density of anomalies has
         reached a level where the ability to perform a required function has
         been interrupted as a defect. See also ITU-T G.806 <xref
         target="G.806" />.</t>

         <t>refer to OAM actions that are carried out continuously or at
         least over long periods of time, permitting proactive reporting of
         fault and/or performance results as proactive OAM.</t>

         <t>refer to OAM actions that are initiated via manual intervention
         for a limited time to carry out troubleshooting as on-demand
         OAM.</t>

         <t>refer to a Label Edge Router (LER), for a given LSP or Section,
         and to a PW Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE), for a given PW, as an
         End Point. Further, we refer to a Label Switching Router (LSR), for
         a given LSP, and to a PW Switching Provider Edge (S-PE), for a given
         PW, as an Intermediate Point. This document does not make a
         distinction between End Points (e.g., source and destination) as it
         can be inferred from the context of the sentences.</t>

         <t>use the term "node" as a general reference to End Points and
         Intermediate Points.</t>

         <t>refer to both segment and concatenated segments as segments (see
         <xref target="RFC5654" /> for definitions relating to the term
         "segment" as well as for other definitions relating to MPLS-TP).</t>

         <t>refer to both single segment PWs and multi-segment PWs as
         PWs.</t>

         <t>refer to both bidirectional associated LSPs and bidirectional
         co-routed LSPs as bidirectional LSPs.</t>
       </list>
     </section>
   </section>

   <section title="OAM Requirements">
     <t>This section lists the requirements by which the OAM functionality of
     MPLS-TP should abide.</t>

     <t>The requirements listed below may be met by one or more OAM
     protocols; the definition or selection of these protocols is outside the
     scope of this document.</t>

     <t>RFC 5654 <xref target="RFC5654"></xref> states (Requirement #2) that
     the MPLS-TP design, SHOULD as far as reasonably possible, reuse existing
     MPLS standards. This general requirement applies to MPLS-TP OAM. MPLS-TP
     OAM is defined in this document through a set of functional
     requirements. These requirements will be met by protocol solutions
     defined in other documents. The way in which those protocols are
     operated and the way in which a network operator can control and use the
     MPLS-TP OAM functions SHOULD be as similar as possible to the mechanisms
     and techniques used to operate OAM in other transport technologies.</t>

     <section title="Architectural Requirements">
       <section title="Scope of OAM">
         <t>The protocol solution(s) developed to meet the requirements
         identified in this document MUST at least be applicable to
         point-to-point bidirectional PWs, point-to-point co-routed
         bidirectional LSPs, and point-to-point bidirectional Sections. <xref
         target="FR"></xref> provides additional information with regard to
         the applicability to point-to-point associated bidirectional LSPs,
         point-to-point unidirectional LSPs, and point-to-multipoint
         LSPs.</t>

         <t>The service emulated by a PW may span multiple domains. An LSP
         may also span multiple domains. The protocol solution(s) MUST be
         applicable to end-to-end and to segments. More generally, it MUST be
         possible to operate OAM functions on a per-domain basis and across
         multiple domains.</t>

         <t>Since LSPs may be stacked, the protocol solution(s) MUST be
         applicable on any LSP, regardless of the label stack depth.
         Furthermore, it MUST be possible to estimate OAM fault and
         performance metrics of a single PW or LSP segment or of an aggregate
         of PW or LSP segments.</t>
       </section>

       <section title="Independence">
         <t>The protocol solution(s) SHOULD be independent of the underlying
         tunneling or point-to-point technology or transmission media.</t>

         <t>The protocol solution(s) SHOULD be independent of the service a
         PW may emulate.</t>

         <t>Any OAM function operated on a PW, LSP, or Section SHOULD be
         independent of the OAM function(s) operated on a different PW, LSP,
         or Section. In other words, only the OAM functions operated on a
         given LSP (for example) should be used to achieve the OAM objectives
         for that LSP.</t>

         <t>The protocol solution(s) MUST support the capability to be
         concurrently and independently operated end-to-end and on segments.
         Therefore, any OAM function applied to segment(s) of a PW or LSP
         SHOULD be independent of the OAM function(s) operated on the
         end-to-end PW or LSP. It SHOULD also be possible to distinguish an
         OAM packet running over a segment of a PW or LSP from another OAM
         packet running on the end-to-end PW or LSP.</t>

         <t>Furthermore, any OAM function applied to segment(s) of a PW or
         LSP SHOULD be independent of the OAM function(s) applied to other
         segment(s) of the same PW or LSP.</t>

         <t><list style="empty">
             <t>Note: Independence should not be understood in terms of
             isolation as there can be interactions between OAM functions
             operated, for example, on two different LSPs.</t>
           </list></t>
       </section>

       <section anchor="DP" title="Data Plane">
         <t>OAM functions operate in the data plane. OAM packets MUST run
         in-band; that is, OAM packets for a specific PW, LSP, or Section
         MUST follow the exact same data path as user traffic of that PW,
         LSP, or Section. This is often referred to as fate sharing.</t>

         <t>It MUST be possible to discriminate user traffic from OAM
         packets. This includes a means to differentiate OAM packets from
         user traffic as well as the capability to apply specific treatment
         to OAM packets, at the nodes processing these OAM packets.</t>

         <t>As part of the design of OAM protocol solution(s) for MPLS-TP, a
         mechanism for enabling the encapsulation and differentiation of OAM
         messages on a PW, LSP, or Section, MUST be provided. Such mechanism
         SHOULD also support the encapsulation and differentiation of
         existing IP/MPLS and PW OAM messages.</t>
       </section>

       <section anchor="IPcap" title="OAM and IP Capabilities">
         <t>There are environments where IP capabilities are present in the
         data plane. IP/MPLS environments are examples of such environments.
         There are also environments where IP capabilities may not be present
         in the data plane. MPLS-TP environments are examples of environments
         where IP capabilities might or might not be
         present.</t>

         <t><list style="empty">
             <t>Note: Presence or absence of IP capabilities is
               deployment scenario dependent.</t>
	 </list></t>

         <t>It MUST be possible to deploy the OAM functionality in any of
         these environments. As a result, it MUST be possible to operate OAM
         functions with or without relying on IP capabilities, and it MUST be
         possible to choose to make use of IP capabilities when these are
         present.</t>

         <t>Furthermore, the mechanism required for enabling the
         encapsulation and differentiation of OAM messages (see <xref
         target="DP"></xref>) MUST support the capability to differentiate
         OAM messages of an OAM function operated by relying on IP
         capabilities (e.g., using encapsulation in an IP header) from OAM
         messages of an OAM function operated without relying on any IP
         capability.</t>

         <t>Note that IP capabilities include the capability to form a
         standard IP header, to encapsulate a payload in an IP header, to
         parse and analyze the fields of an IP header, and to take actions
         based on the content of these fields.</t>

         <t>For certain functions, OAM messages need to incorporate
         identification information (e.g., of source and/or destination
         nodes). The protocol solution(s) MUST at least support
         identification information in the form of an IP addressing structure
         and MUST also be extensible to support additional identification
         schemes.</t>
       </section>

       <section title="Interoperability and Interworking">
         <t>It is REQUIRED that OAM interoperability is achieved between
         distinct domains materializing the environments described in <xref
         target="IPcap"></xref>. It is also REQUIRED that the first two
         requirements of <xref target="IPcap"></xref> still hold and MUST
         still be met when interoperability is achieved.</t>

         <t>When MPLS-TP is run with IP routing and forwarding capabilities,
         it MUST be possible to operate any of the existing IP/MPLS and PW
         OAM protocols (e.g., LSP-Ping <xref target="RFC4379"></xref>,
         MPLS-BFD <xref target="I-D.ietf-bfd-mpls"></xref>, VCCV <xref
         target="RFC5085"></xref>, and VCCV-BFD <xref
         target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-vccv-bfd"></xref>).</t>
       </section>

       <section title="Configuration">
         <t>OAM functions MUST operate and be configurable even in the
         absence of a control plane. Conversely, it SHOULD be possible to
         configure as well as enable/disable the capability to operate OAM
         functions as part of connectivity management, and it SHOULD also be
         possible to configure as well as enable/disable the capability to
         operate OAM functions after connectivity has been established.</t>

         <t>In the latter case, the customer MUST NOT perceive service
         degradation as a result of OAM enabling/disabling. Ideally, OAM
         enabling/disabling should take place without introducing any
         customer impairments (e.g., no customer packet losses). Procedures
         aimed to prevent any traffic impairment MUST be defined for the
         enabling/disabling of OAM functions.</t>

         <t>Means for configuring OAM functions and for connectivity
         management are outside the scope of this document.</t>
       </section>
     </section>

     <section anchor="FR" title="Functional Requirements">
       <t>Hereafter are listed the required functionalities composing the
       MPLS-TP OAM toolset. The list may not be exhaustive and as such the
       OAM mechanisms developed in support of the identified requirements
       SHALL be extensible and thus SHALL NOT preclude the definition of
       additional OAM functionalities, in the future.</t>

       <t>The design of OAM mechanisms for MPLS-TP, MUST allow for the
       ability to support experimental OAM functions. These functions MUST be
       disabled by default.</t>

       <t>The use of any OAM function MUST be optional and it MUST be
       possible to select the set of OAM function(s) to use on any PW, LSP,
       or Section.</t>

       <t>It is RECOMMENDED that any protocol solution, meeting one or more
       functional requirement(s), be the same for PWs, LSPs, and
       Sections.</t>

       <t>It is RECOMMENDED that any protocol solution, meeting one or more
       functional requirement(s), effectively provides a fully featured
       function; that is, a function that is applicable to all the cases
       identified for that functionality. In that context, protocol
       solution(s) MUST state their applicability.</t>

       <t>Unless otherwise stated, the OAM functionalities MUST NOT rely on
       user traffic; that is, only OAM messages MUST be used to achieve the
       objectives.</t>

       <t>For the on-demand OAM functions, the result of which may vary
       depending on packet size, it SHOULD be possible to perform these
       functions using different packet sizes.</t>

       <section title="General Requirements">
         <t>If a defect or fault occurs on a PW, LSP, or Section, mechanisms
         MUST be provided to detect it, diagnose it, localize it, and notify
         the appropriate nodes. Mechanisms SHOULD exist such that corrective
         actions can be taken.</t>

         <t>Furthermore, mechanisms MUST be available for a service provider
         to be aware of a fault or defect affecting the service(s) he
         provides, even if the fault or defect is located outside of his
         domain.</t>

         <t>Protocol solution(s) developed to meet these requirements may
         rely on information exchange. Information exchange between various
         nodes involved in the operation of an OAM function SHOULD be
         reliable such that, for example, defects or faults are properly
         detected or that state changes are effectively known by the
         appropriate nodes.</t>
       </section>

       <section title="Continuity Checks">
         <t>The MPLS-TP OAM toolset MUST provide a function to enable an End
         Point to monitor the liveness of a PW, LSP, or Section.</t>

         <t>This function SHOULD be performed between End Points of PWs,
         LSPs, and Sections.</t>

         <t>This function SHOULD be performed proactively.</t>

         <t>The protocol solution(s) developed to perform this function MUST
         also apply to point-to-point associated bidirectional LSPs,
         point-to-point unidirectional LSPs, and point-to-multipoint
         LSPs.</t>
       </section>

       <section title="Connectivity Verifications">
         <t>The MPLS-TP OAM toolset MUST provide a function to enable an End
         Point to determine whether or not it is connected to specific End
         Point(s) by means of the expected PW, LSP, or Section.</t>

         <t>This function SHOULD be performed proactively between End Points
         of PWs, LSPs, and Sections.</t>

         <t>This function SHOULD be performed on-demand between End Points
         and Intermediate Points of PWs and LSPs, and between End Points of
         PWs, LSPs, and Sections.</t>

         <t>The protocol solution(s) developed to perform this function
         proactively MUST also apply to point-to-point associated
         bidirectional LSPs, point-to-point unidirectional LSPs, and
         point-to-multipoint LSPs.</t>

         <t>The protocol solution(s) developed to perform this function
         on-demand MAY also apply to point-to-point associated bidirectional
         LSPs, to point-to-point unidirectional LSPs, and point-to-multipoint
         LSPs in case a return path exists.</t>
       </section>

       <section title="Route Tracing">
         <t>The MPLS-TP OAM toolset MUST provide functionality to enable an
         End Point to discover the Intermediate (if any) and End Point(s)
         along a PW, LSP, or Section, and more generally to trace the route
         of a PW, LSP, or Section. The information collected MUST include
         identifiers related to the nodes and interfaces composing that
         route.</t>

         <t>This function SHOULD be performed on-demand.</t>

         <t>This function SHOULD be performed between End Points and
         Intermediate Points of PWs and LSPs, and between End Points of PWs,
         LSPs, and Sections.</t>

         <t>The protocol solution(s) developed to perform this function MAY
         also apply to point-to-point associated bidirectional LSPs, to
         point-to-point unidirectional LSPs, and point-to-multipoint LSPs in
         case a return path exists.</t>
       </section>

       <section anchor="DT" title="Diagnostic Tests">
         <t>The MPLS-TP OAM toolset MUST provide a function to enable

         such a diagnostic test consists of performing a loop-back function
         at a node such that all OAM and data traffic are looped back to the
         originating End Point. Another example of such diagnostic test
         consists in estimating the bandwidth of, e.g., an LSP.</t>

         <t><list style="symbols">
             <t>The one-way delay is defined in <xref
             target="RFC2679"></xref> to be the time elapsed from the start
             of transmission of the first bit of a packet by an End Point
             until the reception of the last bit of that packet by the other
             End Point.</t>

             <t>The two-way delay is defined in <xref

   <section title="Congestion Considerations">
     <t>A mechanism (e.g., rate limiting) MUST be provided to prevent OAM
     packets from causing congestion in the Packet Switched Network.</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Security Considerations">
     <t>This document, in itself, does not imply any security consideration
     but OAM, as such, is subject to several security considerations. OAM
     messages can reveal sensitive information such as passwords, performance
     data and details about, e.g., the network topology.</t>

     <t>The nature of OAM therefore suggests having some form of
     authentication, authorization, and encryption in place. This will
     prevent unauthorized access to MPLS-TP equipment and it will prevent
     third parties from learning about sensitive information about the
     transport network.</t>

     <t>OAM systems (network management stations) SHOULD be designed such
     that OAM functions cannot be accessed without authorization.</t>

     <t>OAM protocol solutions MUST include the facility for OAM messages to
     authenticated to prove their origin and to make sure that they are
     destined for the receiving node. The use of such facilities MUST be
     configurable.</t>

     <t>An OAM packet received over a PW, LSP, or Section MUST NOT be
     forwarded beyond the End Point of that PW, LSP, or Section, so as to
     avoid that the OAM packet leaves the current administrative domain.</t>
