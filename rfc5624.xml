      <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
         <t> This document defines a number of Quality of Service
         (QoS) parameters that can be reused for conveying QoS
         information within the Diameter protocol
         <xref target="RFC3588" />. The current set of QoS parameters
         defined in this document are a core subset determined to be
         useful for a wide range of applications. Additional
         parameters may be defined in future documents as the need
         arises and are for future study. The parameters are defined
         as Diameter-encoded Attribute Value Pairs (AVPs), which are described
         using a modified version of the Augmented Backus-Naur Form
         (ABNF), see <xref target="RFC3588"/>. The data types are also
         taken from <xref target="RFC3588"/>.</t>



         <t> The traffic model (TMOD) AVPs are containers consisting
         of four AVPs and provide a way to describe the traffic
         source. </t>
         <t>
            <list style="symbols">
               <t>token rate (r)</t>
               <t>bucket depth (b)</t>
               <t>peak traffic rate (p)</t>
               <t>minimum policed unit (m)</t>
               <t>maximum packet size (M)</t>
            </list>
         </t>

         <t> The encoding of the &lt;TMOD-1&gt; and the &lt;TMOD-2&gt; AVPs can be
            found in Sections <xref format="counter" target="tmod1"/> and
            <xref format="counter" target="tmod2"/>. The semantics of these two AVPs
            are described in Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC2210"/>
            and in Section 3.6 of <xref target="RFC2215"/>.</t>

         <t>The &lt;TMOD-2&gt; AVP is, for example, needed by some
         DiffServ applications.

               <list style="empty">
               <t>It is typically assumed that DiffServ expedited
                  forwarding (EF) traffic is
                  shaped at the ingress by a single-rate token
                  bucket. Therefore, a single TMOD parameter is
                  sufficient to signal DiffServ EF traffic. However,
                  for DiffServ assured forwarding (AF) traffic, two sets of token bucket
                  parameters are needed: one token bucket for the
                  average traffic and one token bucket for the burst
                  traffic. <xref target="RFC2697"/> defines a Single
                  Rate Three Color Marker (srTCM), which meters a
                  traffic stream and marks its packets according to
                  three traffic parameters -- Committed Information Rate
                  (CIR), Committed Burst Size (CBS), and Excess Burst
                  Size (EBS) -- to be either green, yellow, or red. A
                  packet is marked green if it does not exceed the
                  CBS, yellow if it does exceed the CBS but not the
                  EBS, and red otherwise. <xref target="RFC2697"/>
                  defines specific procedures using two token buckets
                  that run at the same rate. Therefore, two TMOD AVPs
                  are sufficient to distinguish among three levels of
                  drop precedence. An example is also described in the
                  appendix of <xref target="RFC2597"/>. </t>

            </list>
         </t>
         <t> Resource reservations might refer to a packet processor
         with a particular DiffServ per-hop behavior (PHB) (using the
         &lt;PHB-Class&gt; AVP). A generic description of the DiffServ
         architecture can be found in <xref target="RFC2475"/>, and the
         Differentiated Services Field is described in Section 3 of
         <xref target="RFC2474"/>. Updated terminology can be found in
         <xref target="RFC3260"/>. Standardized per-hop behavior is,
         for example, described in <xref target="RFC2597"/> ("Assured
         Forwarding PHB Group") and in <xref target="RFC3246"/>
         ("An Expedited Forwarding PHB").</t>


         <t>The above-mentioned parameters are intended to support basic integrated and
            differentiated services functionality in the
            network. Additional parameters can be defined and
            standardized if required to support specific services in the
            future.</t>

               In this case, an arbitrary 12-bit PHB identification

      <section title="Extensibility">
         <t>This document is designed with extensibility in mind, given
            that different organizations and groups are used to
            defining their own Quality of Service parameters. This
            document provides an initial QoS profile with a common set
            of parameters. Ideally, these parameters should be used
            whenever possible, but there are cases where additional
            parameters might be needed or where the parameters
            specified in this document are used with different
            semantics. In that case, it is advisable to define a new QoS
            profile that may consist of new parameters in addition to
            parameters defined in this document or an entirely
            different set of parameters. Finally, it is also possible
            to register a specific QoS profile that defines a specific
            set of QoS values rather than parameters that need to be
            filled with values in order to be used.</t>

         <t>To enable the definition of new QoS profiles, an 8-octet
            registry is defined as a field that is represented by 4-octet
            vendor and 4-octet specifier fields.
            The vendor field
            contains an Enterprise Number as defined in
            <xref target="RFC2578"/>, taken from the values
            maintained in the IANA Enterprise Numbers registry. If the
            four octets of the vendor field are 0x00000000 (reserved
            value for IANA), then the value in the specifier field
            MUST be registered with IANA (see
            <xref target="qosprofile" />). If the
            vendor field is other than 0x00000000, the value of the

         <section anchor="qosprofile" toc="exclude" title="QoS Profile">
            <t>The QoS profile refers to a 64-bit field that is
               represented by 4-octet vendor and 4-octet specifier
               fields. The vendor field indicates the type as either
               standards-specified or vendor-specific. </t>

            <t>If the four octets of the vendor field are 0x00000000, then the value is
               standards-specified and a registry will be created to
               maintain the QoS profile specifier values. The
               specifier field indicates the actual QoS
               profile. Depending on the value requested, the action
               needed to request a new value is: <list style="empty">

                  <t>0 to 511: Standards Action</t>
                  <t>512 to 32767: Specification Required</t>
                  <t>32768 to 4294967295: Reserved</t>
               </list>
            </t>
            <t>Standards action is required to add, depreciate,
            delete, or modify QoS profile values in the range of 0-511,
            and a specification is required to add, depreciate,
            delete, or modify existing QoS profile values in the range
            of 512-32767.</t>

            <t>IANA created such a registry
            and allocated the value zero (0) for the QoS profile
            defined in this document.</t>

            <t> Alternative vendor-specific QoS profiles can be
            created and identified with an Enterprise Number taken from
            the IANA registry created by <xref target="RFC2578"/> in
            the vendor field, combined with a vendor-specific value in
            the specifier field. Allocation of the specifier values is
            the responsibility of the vendor. </t>

      <section title="Security Considerations">
         <t>This document does not raise any security concerns as it
         only defines QoS parameters and does not yet describe how
         they are exchanged in an Authentication, Authorization, and
         Accounting (AAA) protocol. Security considerations are
         described in documents using this specification.</t>
