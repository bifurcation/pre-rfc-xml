          The Kerberos 5 KRB-CRED message is used to transfer Kerberos credentials between
          applications.
          When used with a secure transport, the unencrypted form of the KRB-CRED message may be desirable.
          This document describes the unencrypted form of the KRB-CRED message.

        <section title="Introduction">
        <t>
        There are applications that need to transfer Kerberos credentials between
        them without having a prior relationship with established Kerberos keys.
        When transferred over a transport that provides confidentiality and integrity, the unencrypted form
        of the KRB-CRED message MAY be used.
        One application employing this method is the Kerberos attribute transport mechanism, described in
        Section 2.7 of the <xref target="SAMLv2-KRB-ATTRIB">
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) V2.0 Kerberos Attribute 
Profile</xref>.

        </t>
        <t>
        In the SAML application, the Identity Provider (IdP) somehow obtains a
        Kerberos service ticket from the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC)
        when required by the SAML system
        and transfers the credential to a Service Provider (SP)
        within an attribute statement.
        The SP can then use the credential to access a Kerberos protected service. 
        </t>
        <t>
        The Kerberos 5 specification as described in <xref target="RFC4120"/> mentions the
        non-standard legacy use of unencrypted KRB-CRED messages with the
        Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) <xref target="RFC1964"/>
        by the MIT, Heimdal, and Microsoft Kerberos 
        implementations. This document provides a formal specification of the
unencrypted form of the KRB-CRED message 
        to enable its continued use in new applications.

        <section title="The Unencrypted Form of the KRB-CRED Message">
        <t>
        The unencrypted form of the KRB-CRED message contains EncryptedData as
defined
        in Section 5.2.9 of <xref target="RFC4120"/>.   
        The encryption type (etype) MUST be specified as 0.
        The optional key version number (kvno) SHOULD NOT be present and MUST be ignored by the recipient if present.
        The ciphertext (cipher) is a copy of the EncKrbCredPart, which is in
cleartext, as defined in Section 5.8.1 of <xref target="RFC4120"/>.
        </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Kerberos Encryption Type 0 Is Not an Encryption System">
        <t>
        The Kerberos Encryption Type 0 is an invalid value <xref target="RFC3961"/>. 
        This means that no encryption type with value 0 will ever
        be defined; no encryption or key management operations will use this value.
        Layers above the encryption layer often transport encryption types as integer values.
        These layers are free to use a 0 in an encryption type integer as a
flag or sentinel value, or for
        other context-specific purposes. For example, Section 3 of this specification defines the semantics
        of a 0 carried in the KRB-CRED message's encryption type field.
        In the context of the KRB-CRED message, it is a message-specific indicator to be interpreted
        as the message is not encrypted.  
        This approach was chosen due to existing Kerberos implementations that
        conform to this specification.
        </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Security Considerations">
          <t>
           The KRB-CRED message contains sensitive information related to
           Kerberos credentials being transferred, such as their secret
           session keys, client and server principal names, and validity
           period. Possession of this information, along with the ticket
           itself, would allow an attacker to impersonate the client named
           in the ticket. The possibility of modification of the KRB-CRED
           message enables
           the attacker to substitute the credentials. This can result in the
           recipient using the credentials of a client that was not intended.
           As a result, the KRB-CRED message must be carefully safeguarded.
           </t>
           <t>
           The use of an unencrypted form of the KRB-CRED message MUST only be used with a transport where
           sender and recipient identities can be established to be known to
each other. The transport MUST also 
           provide confidentiality, integrity, and mutual authentication. 
           Examples of transports that MAY be securely used to transport an unencrypted KRB-CRED message
           would include Transport Layer Security (TLS) <xref
target="RFC5246"/>, where mutual authentication has been established,
           or the use of messages where the KRB-CRED is encoded within an encrypted and signed
           <xref target="OASIS-SAMLv2">SAML 2.0</xref>
           statement.
