    <section anchor="sec.intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>The Internet Group Management Protocol <xref
      target="refs.IGMPv3">(IGMP)</xref> for IPv4 and the Multicast Listener
      Discovery <xref target="refs.MLDv2">(MLD)</xref> protocol for IPv6 are
      the standard protocols for hosts to initiate joining or leaving of
      multicast sessions. These protocols must also be supported by multicast
      routers or <xref target="refs.Proxy">IGMP/MLD proxies</xref> that
      maintain multicast membership information on their downstream
      interfaces. Conceptually, IGMP and MLD work on both wireless and mobile
      networks. However, wireless access technologies operate on a shared
      medium or a point-to-point link with limited spectrum and bandwidth. In
      many wireless regimes, it is desirable to minimize multicast-related
      signaling to preserve the limited resources of battery-powered mobile
      devices and the constrained transmission capacities of the networks. The
      motion of a host may cause disruption of multicast service initiation
      and termination in the new or previous network. Slow
      multicast service activation following a join may incur additional delay
      in receiving multicast packets and degrade reception quality. Slow
      service termination triggered by a rapid departure of the mobile host
      without first leaving the group in the previous network may waste network
      resources.</t>

      <t>When IGMP and MLD are used with mobile IP protocols, the proximity of
      network entities should be considered. For example, when a bidirectional
      tunnel is used with the mobility entities described in <xref
      target="refs.PMIPv6"></xref> and <xref target="refs.MIPv6"></xref>, the
      mobile host experiences additional latency because the round-trip time
      using a bidirectional tunnel between mobility entities is larger
      compared to the case where a host and an upstream router attach to a
      LAN.</t>

      <t>This document describes ways to tune IGMPv3 and MLDv2 protocol
      behavior -- on the multicast router and proxy side -- concentrating
      in particular on wireless and mobile networks, including the tuning
      of queries and related timers. This selective optimization provides
      tangible benefits to mobile hosts and routers by keeping track of the
      membership status of downstream hosts, and of various IGMP/MLD Query
      types and values, in order to appropriately tune the number of
      response messages. This document does not make any changes to the
      IGMPv3 and MLDv2 protocols and only suggests optimal settings for the
      configurable parameters of the protocols in mobile and wireless
      environments.</t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>In this document, "router" means both a multicast router and an
      IGMP/MLD proxy.</t>
    </section>

    <!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->

    <section anchor="sec.track" title="Explicit Tracking of Membership Status">
      <t>Mobile hosts use IGMP and MLD to make a request to join or leave
      multicast
      sessions. When an adjacent upstream router receives the IGMP/MLD Report
      messages, it recognizes the membership status on the link. To update the
      membership status reliably, the router sends IGMP/MLD Query messages
      periodically, and sends Group-Specific and/or Group-and-Source-Specific
      Queries when a member host reports its leave. An IGMP/MLD Query is
      therefore necessary to obtain up-to-date membership information, but
      a large number of the reply messages sent from all member hosts may
      cause network congestion or consume network bandwidth.</t>

      <t>The "explicit tracking function" <xref target="refs.explicit"></xref>
      is a possible approach to reduce the transmitted number of IGMP/MLD
      messages and contribute to the efficiency of mobile communications. It
      enables the router to keep track of the membership status of the
      downstream IGMPv3 or MLDv2 member hosts. That is, if a router enables
      the explicit tracking function, it does not always need to request
      transmission of a Current-State Report message from the receiver hosts,
      since the router implicitly recognizes the (potential) last member host
      when it receives the State-Change Report message reporting a leave.
      The router
      can therefore send IGMP/MLD Group-Specific and Group-and-Source-Specific
      Queries LMQC/LLQC times (see <xref target="sec.llqt"></xref>) only
      when it recognizes that the last member has left the
      network. This reduces the transmitted number of Current-State Report
      messages.</t>

      <t>Enabling the explicit tracking function is advantageous for mobile
      multicast, but the function requires additional processing capability
      and, possibly, substantial memory for routers to store all
      membership status information.
      This resource requirement is potentially impacted, especially when a
      router needs to maintain a large number of receiver hosts. Therefore,
      this document recommends that adjacent upstream multicast routers
      enable the explicit tracking function for IP multicast communications on
      wireless and mobile networks, if they have enough resources. If
      operators think that their routers do not have enough resources, they
      may disable this function on their routers. Note that whether or not routers
      enable the explicit tracking function, they need to maintain
      downstream membership status by sending IGMPv3/MLDv2 General Query
      messages, as some IGMPv3/MLDv2 messages may be lost during
      transmission.</t>

      <!-- ============================================================ -->

      <section anchor="sec.genquery"
               title="Tuning the IGMP/MLD General Query Interval">
        <t>IGMP and MLD are unreliable protocols; to cover the possibility
        of a State-Change Report being missed by one or more multicast
        routers, hosts retransmit the same State-Change Report messages
        ([Robustness Variable] - 1) more times, at intervals chosen at random
        from the range (0, [Unsolicited Report Interval]) <xref
        target="refs.IGMPv3"></xref> <xref target="refs.MLDv2"></xref>.
        Although this behavior increases the protocol's robustness, it does not
        guarantee that the State-Change Report reaches the routers. Therefore,
        routers still need to refresh their downstream membership information
        by receiving a Current-State Report, as periodically solicited by
        an IGMP/MLD
        General Query sent in the [Query Interval] period, in order to enhance
        robustness of the host in case of link failures and packet loss.
        This procedure also supports situations where mobile hosts are
        powered off or moved from one network to another network managed by a
        different router without any notification (e.g., a leave request).</t>

        <t>The [Query Interval] is the interval between General Queries sent
        by the regular IGMPv3/MLDv2 querier; the default value is 125
        seconds <xref target="refs.IGMPv3"></xref> <xref
        target="refs.MLDv2"></xref>. By varying the [Query Interval],
        multicast routers can tune the number of IGMP/MLD messages on the
        network; larger values cause IGMP/MLD Queries to be sent less
        often.</t>

        <t>This document proposes a [Query Interval] value of
        150 seconds by changing the Querier's Query Interval Code (QQIC) field 
        in the IGMP/MLD Query message, for the case where a router that
        enables the explicit tracking function potentially
        operates a large number of member hosts, such as more than 200 hosts on
        the wireless link. This longer interval value contributes to
        minimizing Report message traffic and battery-power consumption
        for mobile hosts.</t>

        <t>On the other hand, this document also proposes a [Query Interval]
        value of 60 to 90 seconds for the case where a router that enables the
        explicit tracking function attaches to a higher-capacity wireless
        link. This shorter interval contributes to quick
        synchronization of the membership information tracked by the router
        but may consume battery power on mobile hosts.</t>

        <t>If a router does not enable the explicit tracking function, the
        [Query Interval] value would be its default value -- 125 seconds.</t>

        <t>In situations where <xref target="refs.MIPv6">Mobile IPv6</xref> is
used, when the home agent implements multicast router functionality and
multicast data packets are tunneled to and from the home agent, the home agent
may want to increase the query interval. This happens, for example, when the
home agent detects network congestion. In this case, the home agent starts
forwarding queries with the default [Query Interval] value and increases the
value in a gradual manner.</t>
      </section>

      <!-- ============================================================ -->

      <section anchor="sec.queryresp"
               title="Tuning the IGMP/MLD Query Response Interval">
        <t>The [Query Response Interval] is the Max Response Time (or Max
        Response Delay) used to calculate the Max Resp Code inserted into the
        periodic General Queries. Its default value is 10 seconds, expressed as
        "Max Resp Code=100" for IGMPv3 <xref target="refs.IGMPv3"></xref> and
        "Maximum Response Code=10000" for MLDv2 <xref
        target="refs.MLDv2"></xref>. By varying the [Query Response Interval],
        multicast routers can tune the burstiness of IGMP/MLD messages on the
        network; larger values make the traffic less bursty, as the hosts'
        responses are spread out over a larger interval, but will increase
        join latency when a State-Change Report (i.e., join request) is
        missing.</t>

        <t>According to our experimental analysis, this document proposes two
        scenarios for tuning the [Query Response Interval] value in
        different wireless link conditions: one scenario is for a wireless
        link with lower resource capacity or a lossy link, and
        the other scenario is for a wireless link with enough capacity or
        whose condition is reliable enough for IGMP/MLD message
        transmission.</t>

        <t>Regarding the first scenario, for instance, when a multicast router
        attaches to a bursty IEEE 802.11b link, the router configures a
        longer [Query Response Interval] value, such as 10 to 20 (seconds).
        This configuration will reduce congestion of the Current-State Report
        messages on a link but may increase join latency and leave latency
        when the unsolicited messages (State-Change Records) are lost on the
        router. Note that as defined in Section 4.1.1 of <xref target="refs.IGMPv3" />, in IGMPv3, a Max Resp Code larger than 128
represents the exponential values and changes the granularity. For example, if
one wants to set the Max Response Time to 20.0 seconds, the Max Resp Code
should be expressed as "0b10001001", which is divided into "mant=0b1001" and
"exp=0b000".</t>

        <t>The second scenario may happen for a multicast router attaching to
        a wireless link having higher resource capacity or to a
        point-to-(multi-)point link such as an IEEE 802.16e link because
        IGMP/MLD messages do not seriously affect the condition of the link.
        The
        router can seek Current-State Report messages with a shorter [Query
        Response Interval] value, such as 5 to 10 (seconds). This configuration
        will contribute to (at some level) quickly discovering non-tracked
        member hosts and synchronizing the membership information.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="sec.llqt"
               title="Tuning the Last Member Query Timer (LMQT) and Last Listener Query Timer (LLQT)">
        <t>Shortening the Last Member Query Timer (LMQT) for IGMPv3 and the
        Last Listener Query Timer (LLQT) for MLDv2 contributes to minimizing
        leave latency. LMQT is represented by the Last Member Query Interval
        (LMQI) multiplied by the Last Member Query Count (LMQC), and LLQT is
        represented by the Last Listener Query Interval (LLQI) multiplied by
        the Last Listener Query Count (LLQC).</t>

        <t>While LMQI and LLQI are changeable, it is reasonable to use the
        default value (i.e., 1 second) for LMQI and LLQI in a wireless
        network. LMQC and LLQC, whose default value is the [Robustness
        Variable] value, are also tunable. Therefore, LMQC and LLQC can be set
        to "1" for routers that enable the explicit tracking function, and then
        LMQT and LLQT are set to 1 second. However, setting LMQC and LLQC to 1
        increases the risk of missing the last member; LMQC and LLQC ought to be
        set to 1 only when network operators think that their wireless link is
        stable enough.</t>

        <t>On the other hand, if network operators think that their wireless
        link is lossy (e.g., due to a large number of attached hosts or
        limited resources), they can set LMQC and LLQC to "2" for their
        routers that enable the explicit tracking function. Although bigger LMQC
        and LLQC values may cause longer leave latency, the risk of missing
        the last member will be reduced.</t>
      </section>

      <!-- ============================================================ -->

      <section anchor="sec.startup" title="Tuning the Startup Query Interval">
        <t>The [Startup Query Interval] is the interval between General
        Queries sent by a querier on startup. The default value is 1/4 of
        [Query Interval]; however, a shortened value, such as 1 second,
        would help contribute to shortening handover delay for mobile hosts
        in, for example, the base solution with Proxy Mobile IPv6
        (PMIPv6) <xref target="refs.base" />.
        Note that the [Startup Query Interval] is a static value and cannot be
        changed by any external signal. Therefore, operators who maintain
        routers and wireless links need to properly configure this value.</t>
      </section>

      <!-- ============================================================ -->

      <section anchor="sec.robvar" title="Tuning the Robustness Variable">
        <t>To cover the possibility of unsolicited reports being missed by
        multicast routers, unsolicited reports are retransmitted ([Robustness
        Variable] - 1) more times, at intervals chosen at random from the
        defined range <xref target="refs.IGMPv3"></xref> <xref
        target="refs.MLDv2"></xref>. The QRV (Querier's Robustness Variable)
        field in the IGMP/MLD Query contains the [Robustness Variable] value
        used by the querier. The default [Robustness Variable] value defined in
        <xref target="refs.IGMPv3">IGMPv3</xref> and <xref
        target="refs.MLDv2">MLDv2</xref> is "2".</t>

        <t>This document proposes "2" for the [Robustness Variable] value for
        mobility when a router attaches to a wireless link having lower
        resource capacity or a large number of hosts. For a router that
        attaches to a higher-capacity wireless link known to be
        reliable, retransmitting the same State-Change Report message is not
        required; hence, the router sets the [Robustness Variable] to "1".</t>
      </section>

      <!-- ============================================================ -->

      <section anchor="sec.mobility"
               title="Tuning Scenarios for Various Mobile IP Networks">
        <t>In mobile IP networks, IGMP and MLD are used with three
        deployment scenarios: (1) running directly between a host and access
        router on a wireless network, (2) running between a host and home
        router through a tunnel link, and (3) running between a home
        router and foreign router through a tunnel link.</t>

        <t>When a receiver host connects directly through a wireless link to a
        foreign access router or a home router, the tuning of the IGMP/MLD
        protocol parameters should be the same as suggested in the previous
        sections. The example of this scenario occurs when in <xref target="refs.PMIPv6">PMIPv6</xref>, the mobile access gateway, whose
        role is similar to a foreign router, acts as a multicast router or proxy.</t>

        <t>The second scenario occurs when a bidirectional tunnel established
        between a host and home router is used to exchange IGMP/MLD messages
        <xref target="refs.MIPv6"></xref> <xref target="refs.MIP"></xref>.
        Tuning the parameters is difficult
        in this situation because the condition of the tunnel link is
        diverse and changeable. When a host is far away from the home router,
        the transmission delay between the two entities may be longer and the
        packet delivery may be more unreliable. Thus, the effects of
        IGMP/MLD message transmission through a tunnel link ought to be
        considered when parameters are set. For example, the [Query
        Interval] and [Query Response Interval] could be set shorter to
        compensate for transmission delay, and the [Robustness Variable] could
        be increased to compensate for possible packet loss.</t>

        <t>The third scenario occurs in <xref target="refs.base"></xref>, in
        which the mobile access gateway (i.e., foreign router) acts as the
        IGMP/MLD Proxy <xref target="refs.Proxy"></xref> in PMIPv6 <xref
        target="refs.PMIPv6"></xref>. Through the bidirectional tunnel
        established with the local mobility anchor (i.e., home router), the
        mobile access gateway sends summary reports of its downstream member
        hosts to the local mobility anchor. Apart from the distance factor,
        which influences the parameter setting, the [Query Response Interval]
        on the local mobility anchor could be set to a smaller value because
        the number of mobile access gateways is much smaller compared to
        the number of hosts, and the chance of packet burst is low for the same
        reason. Additionally, the power consumption due to a lower query
        interval is not
        an issue for the mobile access gateways because the mobile access
        gateways are usually not battery-powered.</t>

        <t>Ideally, the IGMP/MLD querier router adjusts its parameter settings
        according to the actual mobile IP network conditions to benefit
        service performance and resource utilization. It would be desirable
        for a home router to determine the aforementioned timers and values
        according to the delay between the initiating IGMP/MLD Query and the
        responding IGMP/MLD Report. However, describing how these timers and
        values can be dynamically adjusted is out of scope for this document.</t>

      specify a channel of interest, using multicast group and source
      addresses in its join request. Upon its reception, the upstream router
      that supports IGMPv3/MLDv2 establishes the shortest-path tree toward the
      source without coordinating a shared tree. This function is called the
      source-filtering function and is required to support <xref
      target="refs.SSM">Source-Specific Multicast (SSM)</xref>.</t>

      <t>Recently, the Lightweight IGMPv3 (LW-IGMPv3) and Lightweight MLDv2
      (LW-MLDv2) <xref target="refs.LW"></xref> protocols have been defined as
      the proposed standard protocols in the IETF. These protocols provide
      protocol simplicity for mobile hosts and routers, as they eliminate a
      complex state machine from the full versions of IGMPv3 and MLDv2 and
      promote the opportunity to implement SSM in mobile communications.</t>

      <t>This document assumes that both multicast routers and mobile hosts
      are IGMPv3/MLDv2 capable, regardless of whether the protocols are the
      full or lightweight version. This document does not consider
      interoperability with older protocol versions. One of the reasons
      for this lack of interoperability with older IGMP/MLD protocols is
      that the explicit
      tracking function does not work properly with older IGMP/MLD
      protocols because of a report-suppression mechanism; a host would
      not send a pending IGMP/MLD Report if a similar report was sent by
      another listener on the link.</t>

    <section anchor="sec.uniquery" title="Unicasting a General Query">

      <t>This appendix describes the possible IGMP and MLD protocol extensions
for further optimization in mobile and wireless environments. It might be
beneficial to include the following considerations when a newer version or
modification of IGMP and MLD protocols is considered in the future.</t>

      <t>IGMPv3 and MLDv2 specifications <xref
      target="refs.IGMPv3"></xref> <xref target="refs.MLDv2"></xref> explain
      that a host must accept and process any query whose IP Destination
      Address field contains any of the addresses (unicast or multicast)
      assigned to the interface on which the query arrives. In general, the
      all-hosts multicast address (224.0.0.1) or link-scope all-nodes
      multicast address (ff02::1) is used as the IP destination address of an
      IGMP/MLD General Query. On the other hand, according to <xref
      target="refs.IGMPv3"></xref> and <xref target="refs.MLDv2"></xref>,
      a router
      may be able to unicast a General Query to the tracked member hosts in
      [Query Interval], if the router keeps track of membership information
      (<xref target="sec.track"></xref>).</t>

      <t>Unicasting an IGMP/MLD General Query would reduce the drain on the
      battery
      power of mobile hosts, as only the active hosts that have been receiving
      multicast contents respond to the unicast IGMP/MLD General Query messages
      and non-active hosts do not need to pay attention to the IGMP/MLD Query
      messages. This also allows the upstream router to proceed with fast
      leaves (or shorten leave latency) by setting LMQC/LLQC smaller because, 
      ideally, the router can immediately converge and update the membership
      information.</t>

      <t>However, there is a concern regarding the unicast General Query:
      if a multicast router sends a General Query "only" by unicast,
      it cannot discover
      potential member hosts whose join requests were lost. Since the hosts do
      not retransmit the same join requests (i.e., unsolicited Report
      messages), they lose the chance to join the channels unless the upstream
      router asks for membership information by sending a multicast General
      Query. This concern will be solved by using both unicast and
      multicast General
      Queries and configuring the [Query Interval] timer value for multicast
      General Query and the [Unicast Query Interval] timer value for unicast
      General Query. However, using two different timers for General Queries
      would require a protocol extension that is beyond the scope of this
      document.
      If a router does not distinguish multicast and unicast General Query
      Intervals, the router should only use and enable multicast General
      Queries.</t>

      <t>Also, the unicast General Query does not remove the need for the
      multicast General Query.  The multicast General Query is necessary
      for updating membership information if the information is not
      correctly synchronized due to missing reports.
      Therefore, the unicast General Query should not be used for an
      implementation that does not allow the configuration of different
      query interval
      timers such as [Query Interval] and [Unicast Query Interval]. If a
      router
      does not distinguish these multicast and unicast General Query
      Intervals, the router should only use and enable multicast General
      Queries.</t>
