		<t> This memo defines a new header field for use with
		    electronic mail messages to indicate the results of
		    message authentication efforts.  Any receiver-side
		    software, such as mail filters or Mail User Agents
		    (MUAs), may use this message header field to relay that
		    information in a convenient way to users or to make
		    sorting and filtering decisions. </t>

	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> This memo defines a new header field for electronic
		    mail messages that presents the results of a message
		    authentication effort in a machine-readable format.
		    The intent is to create a place to collect such data when
		    message authentication mechanisms are in use so that a
		    Mail User Agent (MUA) and downstream filters can
		    make filtering decisions and/or provide a recommendation
		    to the user as to the validity of the message's origin
		    and possibly the integrity of its content. </t>

		<t> End users are not expected to be direct consumers of this
		    header field.  This header field is intended for
		    consumption by programs that will then use or render
		    such data in a human-usable form. </t>

		<t> This memo defines both the format of this new header field
		    and discusses the implications of its presence or
		    absence.  However, it does not discuss how the data
		    contained in the header field should be used (i.e. what
		    filtering decisions are appropriate, or how an MUA might
		    render these results) as these are local policy and/or
		    user interface design questions that are not appropriate
		    for this memo. </t>

		<t> At the time of publication of this memo,
		    <xref target="AUTH"/>,
		    <xref target="DKIM"/>,
		    <xref target="DOMAINKEYS"/>,
		    <xref target="SENDERID"/>, and
		    <xref target="SPF"/>
                    are published DNS domain-level email authentication
		    methods in common use.  This proposal is not intended to
		    be restricted to domain-based authentication, but this has
		    proven to be a good starting point for implementations.
		    As various methods emerge, it is necessary to prepare for
		    their appearance and encourage convergence in the area of
		    interfacing verifiers to filters and MUAs.  </t>

		<t> Although <xref target="SPF"/> defined a header field
		    called Received-SPF and <xref target="DOMAINKEYS"/> defined one
		    called DomainKey-Status for this purpose, those header
		    fields are specific to the conveyance of their respective
		    results only and thus are insufficient to satisfy the
		    requirements enumerated below. </t>

		<section anchor="purpose" title="Purpose">
			<t> The header field defined in this memo is expected
			    to serve several purposes:

			<list style="numbers">
				<t> Convey the results of various message
				    authentication checks being applied by
				    upstream filters and Mail Transfer
				    Agents (MTAs) to MUAs and downstream
				    filters within the same "trust domain",
				    as such agents may wish to render those
				    results to end users or use that data to
				    apply more or less stringent content
				    checks based on authentication
				    results; </t>

				<t> Provide a common location within a message
				    for this data; </t>

				<t> Create an extensible framework for
				    reporting new authentication methods as
				    they emerge. </t>
			</list> </t>

			<t> In particular, the mere presence of this header
			    field should not be construed as meaning that its
			    data is valid, but rather that it is asserting
			    validity based on one or more authentication
			    schemes somewhere upstream.  For an MUA or
			    downstream filter to treat the assertions as
			    actually valid, there must be an assessment of
			    the trust relationship between such agents and
			    the validating MTA. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="trust" title="Trust Boundary">
			<t> This document makes several references to the
			    "trust boundary" of an administrative management
			    domain (ADMD).  Given the diversity among existing
			    mail environments, a precise definition of this
			    term isn't possible. </t>

			<t> Simply put, a transfer from the creator of the
			    header field to the consumer must occur within a
			    context of trust that the creator's information is
			    correct.  How this trust is obtained is outside
			    the scope of this document. It is entirely a local
			    matter. </t>

			<t> Thus, this document defines a "trust boundary" as
			    the delineation between "external" and "internal"
			    entities; "external" here includes all hosts
			    that do not deliberately provide some kind of
			    messaging service for the receiving ADMD's
			    users, and "internal" includes those hosts that
			    do.  By this definition, the hosts within a "trust
			    boundary" may lie entirely within a receiving
			    ADMD's direct control, or they can include hosts
			    managed by another ADMD (such as an ISP or
			    commercial filtering service) but that also
			    provide services for the former. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="scope" title="Processing Scope">
			<t> This proposal is intended to address the needs of
			    authenticating messages or properties of messages
			    during their actual transport.  It is not meant to
			    address the security of messages that might be
			    encapsulated within other messages, such as a
			    message/rfc822 <xref target="MIME"/> part within
			    a message. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="requirements" title="Requirements">
			<t> This memo establishes no new requirements on
			    existing protocols or servers. </t>

			<t> In particular, this memo establishes no requirement
			    on MTAs to reject or filter arriving messages
			    that do not pass authentication checks.  The
			    data conveyed by the defined header field's
			    contents are for the information of MUAs
			    and filters and should be used at their
			    discretion. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="definitions" title="Definitions">
			<t> This section defines various terms used throughout
			    this document. </t>

			<section anchor="defs_general" title="General">
	   			<t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
				    "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
				    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
				    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
				    are to be interpreted as described in
				    <xref target="KEYWORDS"/>. </t>
			</section>

			<section anchor="defs_security" title="Security">
				<t> <xref target="SECURITY"/> discusses
				    authentication and authorization and the
				    conflation of the two concepts.  The use
				    of those terms within the context of
				    recent message-security work has given rise
				    to slightly different definitions, and
				    this document reflects those current
				    usages, as follows:

				    <list style="symbols">
					<t> "Authorization" is the
					    establishment of permission to use
					    a resource or represent an
					    identity.  In this context,
					    authorization indicates that a
					    message from a particular ADMD
					    arrived via a route the ADMD
					    has explicitly approved. </t>

					<t> "Authentication" is the assertion
					    of validity of a piece of data
					    about a message (such as the
					    sender's identity) or the message
					    in its entirety. </t>
				    </list> </t>

				<t> As examples: <xref target="SPF"/> and
				    <xref target="SENDERID"/> are authorization
				    mechanisms in that they express a result
				    that shows whether or not the ADMD that
				    apparently sent the message has explicitly
				    authorized the connecting
				    <xref target="SMTP"/> client to relay
				    messages on its behalf but do not actually
				    validate any property of the message
				    itself.  By contrast, <xref target="DKIM"/>
				    is agnostic as to the routing of a message
				    but uses cryptographic signatures to
				    authenticate agents claiming responsibility
				    for the message (which implies
				    authorization) and ensure it was not
				    modified in transit.  Since the signatures
				    are not tied to SMTP connections, they can
				    be added by either the ADMD of origin,
				    intermediate ADMDs (such as a mailing list
				    server), or both. </t>

				<t> Rather than create a separate header field
				    for each class of solution, this proposal
				    groups them both into a single header
				    field. </t>
			</section>

			<section anchor="defs_email" title="Email Architecture">
				<t> <list style="symbols">
					<t> A "border MTA" is an MTA that
					    acts as a gateway between the
					    general Internet and the users
					    within an organizational
					    boundary.  (See also
					    <xref target="trust"/>.) </t>

					<t> A "delivery MTA" (or Mail Delivery
					    Agent or MDA) is an MTA that
					    actually enacts delivery of a
					    message to a user's inbox or other
					    final delivery. </t>

					<t> An "intermediate MTA" is an MTA
					    that handles messages after a
					    border MTA and before a delivery

				<t> Generally, it is assumed that the work of
				    applying message authentication schemes
				    takes place at a border MTA or a delivery
				    MTA.  This specification is written with
				    that assumption in mind.  However, there
				    are some sites at which the entire mail
				    infrastructure consists of a single host.
				    In such cases, such terms as "border MTA"
				    and "delivery MTA" may well apply to the
				    same machine or even the very same agent.
				    It is also possible that some message
				    authentication tests could take place on
				    an intermediate MTA.  Although this
				    document doesn't specifically describe
				    such cases, they are not meant to be
				    excluded from this specification. </t>

				    system architecture, and

				    aspects of email authentication in current

		<section anchor="environment" title="Trust Environment">
			<t> This new header field permits one or more message
			    validation mechanisms to communicate its output to
			    one or more separate assessment mechanisms.  These
			    mechanisms operate within a unified trust boundary
			    that defines an Administrative Management Domain
			    (ADMD).  An ADMD contains one or more entities
			    that perform validation and generate the header
			    field, and one or more that consume it for some
			    type of assessment.  The field contains no
			    integrity or validation mechanism of its own, so
			    its presence must be trusted implicitly.  Hence,
			    use of the header field depends upon ensuring that
			    mail entering the ADMD has instances of the header
			    field claiming to be valid within its boundaries
			    removed, so that occurrences of such header fields
			    can be used safely by consumers. </t>

			<t> The "authserv-id" token defined in

			    label an entire ADMD or a specific validation
			    engine within an ADMD.  Although the labeling

			    within this proposal. </t>

	<section anchor="format" title="Definition and Format of the Header Field">
		<t> This section gives a general overview of the format
		    of the header field being defined, and then provides more
		    formal specification. </t>

		<section anchor="format_general" title="General Description">

			<t> This new header field SHOULD be added at the top of
			    the message as it transits MTAs that do
			    authentication checks so some idea of how far away
			    the checks were done can be inferred.  It therefore
			    should be treated as a Trace Field as

			    the related definitions in that document
			    apply.  </t>

			<t> The value of the header field (after removing
			    <xref target="MAIL"/> comments) consists
			    of an authentication identifier, an optional
			    version, and then a series of "method=result"
			    statements indicating which authentication
			    method(s) were applied and their respective
			    results, and then, for each applied method,

			    conclusion. </t>

		</section>

		<section anchor="identifier" title="Authentication Identifier Field">
			<t> Every Authentication-Results header field 
			    has an authentication identifier field
			    ("authserv-id" above).  This is similar in
			    syntax to a fully-qualified domain name. </t>

			<t> The authentication identifier field provides a
			    unique identifier that refers to the authenticating
			    service within a given ADMD.  The uniqueness of
			    the identifier MUST be guaranteed by the ADMD
			    that generates it and must pertain to exactly that
			    one ADMD.  This identifier is intended to be
			    machine-readable and not necessarily meaningful to
			    users.  MUAs or downstream filters SHOULD use this
			    identifier to determine whether or not the data
			    contained in an Authentication-Results header
			    field should be used. </t>

			<t> For simplicity and scalability, the authentication
			    identifier SHOULD be a common token used
			    throughout the ADMD, such as the DNS domain
			    name used by or within that ADMD. </t>

			<t> For tracing and debugging purposes, the
			    authentication identifier MAY instead be the
			    hostname of the MTA performing the authentication
			    check whose result is being reported.  This
			    is also useful for another purpose, as described
			    in <xref target="adding"/>.  Moreover,
			    some implementations have considered appending a
			    delimiter such as "/" and following it with useful
			    transport tracing data such as the
			    <xref target="SMTP"/> queue ID or a timestamp. </t>

			<t> It should be noted, however, that using a local,
			    relative identifier like a single hostname, rather
			    than a hierarchical and globally unique ADMD
			    identifier like a DNS domain name, makes
			    configuration more difficult for large sites.  The
			    hierarchical identifier permits aggregating
			    related, trusted systems together under a single,
			    parent identifier, which in turn permits assessing
			    the trust relationship with a single reference.
			    The alternative is a flat namespace requiring
			    individually listing each trusted system.  Since
			    consumers must use the identifier to determine
			    whether to use the contents of the header field:

			    <list style="symbols">
				<t> Changes to the identifier impose a large,
				    centralized administrative burden. </t>

				<t> Ongoing administrative changes require
				    constantly updating this centralized
				    table, making it difficult to ensure
				    that an MUA or downstream filter will have
				    access to accurate information for
				    assessing the usability of the header
				    field's content.  In particular, consumers
				    of the header field will need to know not
				    only the current identifier(s) in use,
				    but previous ones as well to account
				    for delivery latency or later
				    re-assessment of the header field's
				    contents. </t>
			    </list> </t>

	<section anchor="iprev" title="The &quot;iprev&quot; Authentication Method">
		<t> This section defines an additional authentication method
		    called "iprev". </t>

		<t> In general, "iprev" is an attempt to verify that a client
		    appears to be valid based on some DNS queries.
		    Upon receiving a session initiation of some kind from
		    a client, the IP address of the client peer is queried
		    for matching names (i.e., a number-to-name translation,
		    also known as a "reverse lookup" or a "PTR" record
		    query).  Once that result is acquired, a lookup of each
		    of the names (i.e., a name-to-number translation, or an "A"
		    or "AAAA" record query) thus retrieved is done.  The
		    response to this second check should result in at least
		    one mapping back to the client's IP address. </t>

		<t> More algorithmically: if the client peer's IP address is I,
		    the list of names to which I maps (after a "PTR" query)
		    is the set N, and the union of IP addresses to which each
		    member of N maps (after corresponding "A" and "AAAA"
		    queries) is L, then this test is successful if I is an
		    element of L. </t>

		<t> The response to a PTR query could contain multiple names.
		    To prevent heavy DNS loads, agents performing these queries
		    MUST be implemented such that the number of names evaluated
		    by generation of corresponding A or AAAA queries is
		    finite, though it MAY be configurable by an administrator.
		    As an example, Section 5.5 of <xref target="SPF"/> chose a
		    limit of 10 for its implementation of this algorithm. </t>

		<t> <xref target="DNS-IP6"/> discusses the query formats for
		    the IPv6 case. </t>

		<t> A successful test using this algorithm constitutes a
		    result of "pass" since the ADMD in which the client's
		    PTR claims it belongs has confirmed that claim by including
		    corresponding data in its DNS domain.  A failure to match
		    constitutes a "fail".  There is no case in which a
		    "neutral" result can be returned.  The remaining
		    "temperror" and "permerror" cases refer, respectively, to
		    temporary and permanent DNS query errors. </t>

		<t> There is some contention regarding the wisdom and
		    reliability of this test.  For example, in some regions
		    it can be difficult for this test ever to pass because
		    the practice of arranging to match the forward and
		    reverse DNS is infrequently observed.  Therefore,
		    the actual implementation details of how a verifier
		    performs an "iprev" test are not specified here.  The
		    verifier MAY report a successful or failed "iprev" test
		    at its discretion having done some kind of check of
		    the validity of the connection's identity using DNS.  It is
		    incumbent upon an agent making use of the reported "iprev"
		    result to understand what exactly that particular verifier
		    is attempting to report. </t>

		<t> Extensive discussion of reverse DNS mapping and its
		    implications can be found in
		    <xref target="DNSOP-REVERSE"/>.  In
		    particular, it recommends that applications avoid using
		    this test as a means of authentication or security.  Its
		    presence in this memo is not an endorsement, but is merely
		    acknowledgement that the method remains common and
		    provides the means to relay the results of that test.  </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="adding" title="Adding the Header Field to A Message">
		<t> This specification makes no attempt to evaluate the
		    relative strengths of various message authentication
		    methods that may become available.  As such, the order
		    of the presented authentication methods and results
		    MUST NOT be used either to imply or infer the importance
		    or strength of any given method over another.  Instead,
		    the MUA or downstream filter consuming this header field
		    must interpret the result of each method based on its
		    own knowledge of what that method evaluates. </t>

		<t> Each "method" MUST refer to an authentication method
		    declared in the IANA registry, or an extension method
		    as defined in <xref target="x_methods"/>, and each
		    "result" MUST refer to a result code declared in the
		    IANA registry, or an extension result code as defined
		    in <xref target="x_results"/>.  See
		    <xref target="iana"/> for further information about
		    the registered methods and result codes. </t>

		<t> An MTA compliant with this specification MUST add this
		    header field (after performing one or more message
		    authentication tests) to indicate which MTA or ADMD
		    performed the test, which test got applied and what the
		    result was.  If an MTA applies more than one such test,
		    it MUST add this header field either once per test, or
		    once indicating all of the results.  An MTA MUST NOT add
		    a result to an existing header field. </t>

		<t> An MTA MAY add this header field containing only the
		    authentication identifier portion to indicate explicitly
		    that no message authentication schemes were applied prior
		    to delivery of this message. </t>

		<t> An MTA adding this header field must take steps to identify
		    it as legitimate to the MUAs or downstream filters that
		    will ultimately consume its content.  One required process
		    to do so is described in <xref target="removing"/>.
		    Further measures may be required in some environments.
		    Some possible solutions are enumerated in
		    <xref target="forged_headers"/>.  This memo does not
		    mandate any specific solution to this issue as each
		    environment has its own facilities and limitations. </t>

		<t> For MTAs that add this header field, adding header
		    fields in order (at the top), per Section 3.6 of <xref target="MAIL"/>,
		    is particularly important.  Moreover,
		    this header field SHOULD be inserted above any other trace
		    header fields such MTAs might prepend.  This allows easy
		    detection of header fields that can be trusted. </t>

		<t> End users making direct use of this header field may
		    inadvertently trust information that has not been properly
		    vetted.  If, for example, a basic <xref target="SPF"/>
		    result were to be relayed that claims an authenticated
		    addr-spec, the local-part of that addr-spec has actually
		    not been authenticated.  Thus, an MTA adding this
		    header field SHOULD NOT include any data that has not
		    been authenticated by the method(s) being applied. 
		    Moreover, MUAs SHOULD NOT render to users such information
		    if it is presented by a method known not to authenticate
		    it. </t>

		<section anchor="position" title="Header Field Position and Interpretation">
			<t> In order to ensure non-ambiguous results and avoid
			    the impact of false header fields, MUAs and
			    downstream filters SHOULD NOT interpret this header
			    field unless specifically instructed to do so by
			    the user or administrator.  That is, this
			    interpretation should not be "on by default".
			    Naturally then, users or administrators should not
			    activate such a feature unless they are certain
			    the header field will be added by the border MTA
			    that accepts the mail that is ultimately read by
			    the MUA, and instances of the header field
			    appearing to be from within the ADMD but actually
			    added by foreign MTAs will be removed before
			    delivery. </t>

			<t> Furthermore, MUAs and downstream filters SHOULD
			    NOT interpret this header field unless the
			    authentication identifier it bears appears to be
			    one used within its own ADMD as configured
			    by the user or administrator. </t>

			<t> MUAs and downstream filters MUST ignore any
			    result reported using a "result" not specified in
			    the result code registry, or a "ptype" not listed
			    in the corresponding registry for such values as
			    defined in <xref target="iana"/>.  Moreover, such
			    agents MUST ignore a result indicated for any
			    "method" they do not specifically support. </t>

			<t> An MUA SHOULD NOT reveal these results to 
			    end users unless the results are accompanied by,
			    at a minimum, some associated reputation data about
			    the authenticated origin identifiers within the
			    message.  For example, an attacker could register
			    examp1e.com (note the digit "one") and send
			    signed mail to intended victims; a verifier
			    would detect that the signature was valid and
			    report a "pass" even though it's clear the
			    DNS domain name was intended to mislead.  See
			    <xref target="misleading"/> for further
			    discussion. </t>

			<t> As stated in <xref target="format_general"/>,
			    this header field SHOULD be treated as though
			    it were a trace header field as defined in Section
			    3.6.7 of <xref target="MAIL"/>, and
			    hence MUST NOT be reordered and MUST be
			    prepended to the message, so that there is
			    generally some indication upon delivery of where
			    in the chain of handling MTAs the message
			    authentication was done. </t>

			<t> MUAs SHOULD ignore instances of this header field
			    discovered within message/rfc822
			    <xref target="MIME"/> attachments. </t>

			<t> Further discussion of this can be found in
			    <xref target="security"/> below. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="policy" title="Local Policy Enforcement">
			<t> If a site's local policy is to consider a 
			    non-recoverable failure result (e.g., "fail" for
			    DKIM, "hardfail" for SPF) for any particular
			    authentication
			    method as justification to reject the message
			    completely, the border MTA SHOULD issue an
			    <xref target="SMTP"/> rejection response to the
			    message rather than adding this header field with
			    the failure result and allowing it to proceed
			    toward delivery.  This is more desirable than
			    allowing the message to reach an internal host's
			    MTA or spam filter, thus possibly generating a
			    local rejection such as a <xref target="DSN"/> to
			    a forged originator. </t>

			<t> The same MAY also be done for local policy
			    decisions overriding the results of the
			    authentication methods (e.g., the "policy" result
			    codes described in <xref target="results"/>). </t>

			<t> Such rejections at the SMTP protocol level are not
			    possible if local policy is enforced at the MUA
			    and not the MTA.  Unfortunately, this may be
			    a common scenario. </t>

	</section>

	<section anchor="removing" title="Removing the Header Field">
		<t> For security reasons, any MTA conforming to this
		    specification MUST delete any discovered instance of
		    this header field that claims to have been added within
		    its trust boundary and that did not come from another
		    trusted MTA.  For example, an MTA (border or otherwise)
		    for example.com receiving a message MUST delete any
		    instance of this header field bearing an authentication
		    identifier indicating the header field was added within
		    example.com prior to adding its own header fields.  This
		    may mean each MTA will have to be equipped with a list of
		    internal MTAs known to be compliant (and hence
		    trustworthy). </t>

		<t> For simplicity and maximum security, a border MTA MAY
		    remove all instances of this header field on mail crossing
		    into its trust boundary.  However, this may conflict with
		    the desire to access authentication results performed by
		    trusted external service providers.  It may also invalidate
		    signed messages whose signatures cover external instances
		    of this header field.  A more robust border MTA could
		    allow a specific list of authenticating MTAs whose
		    information should be let in, removing all others. </t>

		<t> As stated in <xref target="trust"/>, a formal definition
		    of "trust boundary" is deliberately not made here.  It is
		    entirely possible that a border MTA for example.com might
		    explicitly trust authentication results asserted by
		    upstream host example.net even though they exist in
		    completely disjoint administrative boundaries.  In that
		    case, the border MTA MAY elect not to delete those results;
		    moreover, the upstream host doing some authentication work
		    could apply a signing technology such as
		    <xref target="DKIM"/> on its own results to assure
		    downstream hosts of their authenticity.  An example of
		    this is provided in <xref target="examples"/>. </t>

		<t> Similarly, in the case of messages signed using
		    <xref target="DKIM"/> or other message signing methods
		    that sign header fields, this may invalidate one or more
		    signatures on the message if they covered the header
		    field to be removed at the time of signing.  This
		    behavior can be desirable since there's little value in
		    validating the signature on a message with forged
		    headers.  However, signing agents MAY therefore elect to
		    omit these header fields from signing to avoid this
		    situation. </t>

		<t> An MTA SHOULD remove any instance of this header field
		    bearing a version (express or implied) that it does not
		    support.  However, an MTA MUST remove such a header
		    if the <xref target="SMTP"/> connection relaying the
		    message is not from a trusted internal MTA. </t>

	<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
		<t> The following security considerations apply when
		    adding or processing the "Authentication-Results"
		    header field: </t>

		<section anchor="forged_headers" title="Forged Header Fields">
			<t> An MUA or filter that accesses a mailbox whose
			    mail is handled by a non-conformant MTA, and
			    understands Authentication-Results header fields,
			    could potentially make false conclusions based on
			    forged header fields.  A malicious user or agent
			    could forge a header field using the DNS domain
			    of a receiving ADMD as the authserv-id token
			    in the value of the header field, and with the
			    rest of the value claim that the message was
			    properly authenticated.  The non-conformant MTA
			    would fail to strip the forged header field, and
			    the MUA could inappropriately trust it. </t>

			<t> It is for this reason an MUA should not have
			    processing of the "Authentication-Results" header
			    field enabled by default; instead it should be
			    ignored, at least for the purposes of enacting
			    filtering decisions, unless specifically enabled
			    by the user or administrator after verifying that
			    the border MTA is compliant.  It is acceptable to
			    have an MUA aware of this specification, but have
			    an explicit list of hostnames whose
			    "Authentication-Results" header
			    fields are trustworthy; however, this list should
			    initially be empty. </t>

			<t> Proposed alternate solutions to this problem are
			    nascent:

			    <list style="numbers">
				<t> Possibly the simplest is a digital
				    signature protecting the header field,
				    such as using <xref target="DKIM"/>, that
				    can be verified by an MUA by using a
				    posted public key.  Although one of the
				    main purposes of this memo is to
				    relieve the burden of doing message
				    authentication work at the MUA, this only
				    requires that the MUA learn a single
				    authentication scheme even if a number
				    of them are in use at the border MTA.
				    Note that <xref target="DKIM"/> requires
				    that the From header field be signed,
				    although in this application, the signing
				    agent (a trusted MTA) likely cannot
				    authenticate that value, so the fact that
				    it is signed should be ignored. </t>

				<t> Another would be a means to interrogate
				    the MTA that added the header field to
				    see if it is actually providing any
				    message authentication services and saw
				    the message in question, but this isn't
				    especially palatable given the work
				    required to craft and implement such a
				    scheme. </t>

				<t> Yet another might be a method to
				    interrogate the internal MTAs that
				    apparently handled the message
				    (based on Received: header fields) to
				    determine whether any of them conform to
				    <xref target="removing"/> of this
				    memo.  This, too, has potentially high
				    barriers-to-entry. </t>

				<t> Extensions to <xref target="IMAP"/>,
				    <xref target="SMTP"/>, and
				    <xref target="POP3"/> could be defined
				    to allow an MUA or filtering agent
				    to acquire the "authserv-id" in use
				    within an ADMD, thus allowing it to
				    identify which Authentication-Results
				    header fields it can trust. </t>

				<t> On the presumption that internal MTAs
				    are fully compliant with Section 3.6 of
				    <xref target="MAIL"/>, and the compliant
				    internal MTAs are using their own host
				    names or the ADMD's DNS domain name as the
				    "authserv-id" token, the header field
				    proposed here should always appear above
				    a Received: header added by a trusted
				    MTA.  This can be used as a test for
				    header field validity. </t>
			    </list> </t>

			<t> Support for some of these is planned for future
			    work. </t>

			<t> In any case, a mechanism needs to exist for an
			    MUA or filter to verify that the host that appears
			    to have added the header field (a) actually did
			    so, and (b) is legitimately adding that header
			    field for this delivery.  Given the variety
			    of messaging environments deployed today,
			    consensus appears to be that specifying a
			    particular mechanism for doing so is not
			    appropriate for this memo. </t>
		
			<t> Mitigation of the forged header field attack can
			    also be accomplished by moving the authentication
			    results data into meta-data associated with
			    the message.  In particular, an
			    <xref target="SMTP"/> extension could be
			    established which is used to communicate
			    authentication results from the border MTA to
			    intermediate and delivery MTAs; the latter of
			    these could arrange to store the authentication
			    results as meta-data retrieved and rendered
			    along with the message by an <xref target="IMAP"/>
			    client aware of a similar extension in that
			    protocol.  The delivery MTA would be told to
			    trust data via this extension only from
			    MTAs it trusts, and border MTAs would not accept
			    data via this extension from any source.  There is
			    no vector in such an arrangement for forgery of
			    authentication data by an outside agent. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="misleading" title="Misleading Results">
			<t> Until some form of service for querying
			    the reputation of a sending agent is widely
			    deployed, the existence of this header field
			    indicating a "pass" does not render the message
			    trustworthy.  It is possible for an arriving
			    piece of spam or other undesirable mail to pass
			    checks by several of the methods enumerated above
			    (e.g., a piece of spam signed using
			    <xref target="DKIM"/> by the originator of the
			    spam, which might be a spammer or a compromised
			    system).  In particular, this issue is not resolved
			    by forged header field removal discussed
			    above. </t>

			<t> Hence, MUAs and downstream filters must take some
			    care with use of this header even after possibly
			    malicious headers are scrubbed.  </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="position2" title="Header Field Position">
			<t> Despite the requirements of
			    <xref target="MAIL"/>, header fields can
			    sometimes be reordered enroute by
			    intermediate MTAs.  The goal of requiring header
			    field addition only at the top of a message is an
			    acknowledgement that some MTAs do reorder
			    header fields, but most do not.  Thus, in the
			    general case, there will be some indication of
			    which MTAs (if any) handled the message after the
			    addition of the header field defined here. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="iprev-dos" title="Reverse IP Query Denial-of-Service Attacks">
			<t> Section 5.5 of <xref target="SPF"/> describes
			    a DNS-based denial-of-service attack for verifiers

			    wishing to do this check and report this
			    information SHOULD take care not to go to unbounded
			    lengths to resolve "A" and "PTR" queries.
			    MUAs or other filters making use of an "iprev"

		<section anchor="method-attacks" title="Attacks against Authentication Methods">
			<t> If an attack becomes known against an

			    verifying that method can be fooled into thinking
			    an inauthentic message is authentic, and thus
			    the value of this header field can be misleading.
			    It follows that any attack against the
			    authentication methods supported by this document
			    (and later amendments to it) is also a
			    security consideration here. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="bugs" title="Intentionally Malformed Header Fields">
			<t> It is possible for an attacker to add an
			    Authentication-Results header field that
			    is extraordinarily large or otherwise malformed
			    in an attempt to discover or exploit weaknesses
			    in header field parsing code.  Implementors must
			    thoroughly verify all such header fields received

			    fields. </t>

		<section anchor="compromised" title="Compromised Internal Hosts">
			<t> An internal MUA or MTA that has been compromised
			    could generate mail with a forged From header
			    field and a forged Authentication-Results header
			    field that endorses it.  Although it is clearly a
			    larger concern to have compromised internal
			    machines than it is to prove the value of this
			    header field, this risk can be mitigated by
			    arranging that internal MTAs will remove this
			    header field if it claims to have been added by a
			    trusted border MTA (as described above), yet the 
			    <xref target="SMTP"/> connection is not coming from
			    an internal machine known to be running an
			    authorized MTA.  However, in such a configuration,
			    legitimate MTAs will have to add this header

		<section anchor="encapsulated" title="Encapsulated Instances">

			<t> Since MTAs are unlikely to strip

<t>Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax.  Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>STD 11, RFC 822, defines a message representation protocol specifying considerable detail about US-ASCII message headers, and leaves the message content, or message body, as flat US-ASCII text.  This set of documents, collectively called the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, or MIME, redefines the format of messages to allow for</t>
<t>(1)   textual message bodies in character sets other than US-ASCII,</t>
<t>(2)   an extensible set of different formats for non-textual message bodies,</t>
<t>(3)   multi-part message bodies, and</t>
<t>(4)   textual header information in character sets other than US-ASCII.</t>
<t>These documents are based on earlier work documented in RFC 934, STD 11, and RFC 1049, but extends and revises them.  Because RFC 822 said so little about message bodies, these documents are largely orthogonal to (rather than a revision of) RFC 822.</t>
<t>This initial document specifies the various headers used to describe the structure of MIME messages. The second document, RFC 2046, defines the general structure of the MIME media typing system and defines an initial set of media types. The third document, RFC 2047, describes extensions to RFC 822 to allow non-US-ASCII text data in Internet mail header fields. The fourth document, RFC 2048, specifies various IANA registration procedures for MIME-related facilities. The fifth and final document, RFC 2049, describes MIME conformance
  criteria as well as providing some illustrative examples of MIME message formats, acknowledgements, and the bibliography.</t>
<t>These documents are revisions of RFCs 1521, 1522, and 1590, which themselves were revisions of RFCs 1341 and 1342.  An appendix in RFC 2049 describes differences and changes from previous versions.</t></abstract></front>

<t>This memo defines a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) content-type that may be used by a message transfer agent (MTA) or electronic mail gateway to report the result of an attempt to deliver a message to one or more recipients.  This content-type is intended as a machine-processable replacement for the various types of delivery status notifications currently used in Internet electronic mail.  Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other messaging systems (such as X.400 or the so-called "Local Area Network (LAN)-based" systems), the Delivery Status Notification (DSN) protocol is designed to be useful in a multi-protocol messaging environment.  To this end, the protocol described in this memo provides for the carriage of "foreign" addresses and error codes, in addition to those normally used in Internet mail.  Additional attributes may also be defined to support "tunneling" of foreign notifications through Internet mail. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<abstract><t>Over its thirty-five year history, Internet Mail has changed significantly in scale and complexity, as it has become a global infrastructure service.  These changes have been evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, reflecting a strong desire to preserve both its installed base and its usefulness.

But the many differences in perspective currently make it difficult to know exactly what another participant means.

<t>Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; This document obsoletes RFC 2434.

<abstract>
<t>The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1) allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server.  IMAP4rev1 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote message folders) in a way that is functionally equivalent to local folders.  IMAP4rev1 also provides the capability for an offline client to resynchronize with the server.  IMAP4rev1 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes, checking for new messages, permanently removing messages, setting and clearing flags, RFC 2822 and RFC 2045 parsing, searching, and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions thereof.  Messages in IMAP4rev1 are accessed by the use of numbers.  These numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique identifiers.  IMAP4rev1 supports a single server.  A mechanism for accessing configuration information to support multiple IMAP4rev1 servers is discussed in RFC 2244.  IMAP4rev1 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is handled by a mail transfer protocol such as RFC 2821. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<t>This document is a specification of the basic protocol for Internet electronic mail transport.  It consolidates, updates, and clarifies several previous documents, making all or parts of most of them obsolete.  It covers the SMTP extension mechanisms and best practices for the contemporary Internet, but does not provide details about particular extensions.  Although SMTP was designed as a mail transport and delivery protocol, this specification also contains information that is important to its use as a "mail submission" protocol for "split-UA" (User Agent) mail reading systems and mobile environments.

<abstract>
<t>E-mail on the Internet can be forged in a number of ways.  In particular, existing protocols place no restriction on what a sending host can use as the reverse-path of a message or the domain given on the SMTP HELO/EHLO commands.  This document describes version 1 of the ender Policy Framework (SPF) protocol, whereby a domain may explicitly authorize the hosts that are allowed to use its domain name, and a receiving host may check such authorization.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t></abstract></front>

	<section anchor="legacy_muas" title="Legacy MUAs">
		<t> Implementors of this proposal should be aware
		    that many MUAs are unlikely to be retrofitted to
		    support the new header field and its semantics.  In
		    the interests of convenience and quicker
		    adoption, a delivery MTA might want to
		    consider adding things that are processed by
		    existing MUAs in addition to the Authentication-Results
		    header field.  One suggestion is to include a Priority
		    header field, on messages that don't already have such a
		    header field, containing a value that reflects the
		    strength of the authentication that was accomplished,
		    e.g., "low" for weak or no authentication, "normal" or
		    "high" for good or strong authentication. </t>

		<t> Some modern MUAs can already filter based on
		    the content of this header field.  However, there is
		    keen interest in having MUAs make some kind of
		    graphical representation of this header field's meaning
		    to end users.  Until this capability is added, other
		    interim means of conveying authentication results may
		    be necessary while this proposal and its successors
		    are adopted. </t>

			</figure>

			<t> The "Authentication-Results" header field is
			    present, indicating conformance to this
			    specification.  Once again, the authserv-id used
			    is the recipient's DNS domain name.  The header
			    field is present twice because two different MTAs
			    in the chain of delivery did authentication tests.
			    The first, "mail-router.example.com" reports that
			    <xref target="AUTH"/> and
			    <xref target="SPF"/> were both used, and
			    <xref target="AUTH"/> passed but
			    <xref target="SPF"/> failed.  In the
			    <xref target="AUTH"/> case, additional data is
			    provided in the comment field, which the MUA can
			    choose to render if desired. </t>

			<t> The second MTA, "auth-checker.example.com",
			    reports that it did a <xref target="SENDERID"/>
			    test (which failed) and a <xref target="DKIM"/>
			    test (which passed).  Again, additional data about
			    one of the tests is provided as a comment, which
			    the MUA may choose to render. </t>

			<t> Since different hosts did the two sets of
			    authentication checks, the header fields cannot be
			    consolidated in this example. </t>

			<t> This example illustrates more typical transmission
			    of mail into "example.com" from a user on a
			    dialup connection "example.net".  The user appears
			    to be legitimate as he/she had a valid password
			    allowing authentication at the border MTA using
			    <xref target="AUTH"/>.  The <xref target="SPF"/>
			    and <xref target="SENDERID"/> tests failed since
			    "example.com" has not granted "example.net"
			    authority to relay mail on its behalf.  However,
		 	    the <xref target="DKIM"/> test passed because
			    the sending user had a private key matching one
			    of "example.com"'s published public keys and
			    used it to sign the message. </t>

			<t> In this example we see multi-tiered authentication
			    with an extended trust boundary. </t>

			<t> The message was sent from someone at example.com's
			    New York office (newyork.example.com) to a
			    mailing list managed at an intermediary.
			    The message was signed at the origin using
			    <xref target="DKIM"/>. </t>

			<t> The message was sent to a mailing list service
			    provider called example.net, which is used by
			    example.com.  There, meetings@example.net
			    is expanded to a long list of recipients, one
			    of that is at the Chicago office.  In this
			    example, we will assume that the trust boundary
			    for chicago.example.com includes the mailing list
			    server at example.net. </t>

			<t> The mailing list server there first authenticated
			    the message and affixed an
			    Authentication-Results header field indicating
			    such using its DNS domain name for the authserv-id.
			    It then altered the message by affixing some
			    footer text to the body, including some
			    administrivia such as unsubscription
			    instructions.  Finally, the mailing list server
			    affixes a second <xref target="DKIM"/> signature
			    and begins distribution of the message. </t>

			<t> The border MTA for chicago.example.com explicitly
			    trusts results from mail-router.example.net
			    so that header field is not removed.  It performs
			    evaluation of both signatures and determines
			    that the first (most recent) is a "pass" but,
			    because of the aforementioned modifications, the
			    second is a "fail".  However, the first
			    signature included the Authentication-Results
			    header added at mail-router.example.net
			    that validated the second signature.
			    Thus, indirectly, it can be determined that
			    the authentications claimed by both signatures are
			    indeed valid. </t>

	<section anchor="op_considerations" title="Operational Considerations about Message Authentication">
		<t> This proposal is predicated on the idea that authentication
		    (and presumably in the future, reputation) work is
		    typically done by border MTAs rather than MUAs or
		    intermediate MTAs; the latter merely make use of the
		    results determined by the former.  Certainly this is
		    not mandatory for participation in electronic mail or
		    message authentication, but the work of this proposal
		    and its deployment to date is based on that model.  The
		    assumption satisfies several common ADMD requirements:

		    <list style="numbers">
			<t> Service operators prefer to resolve the handling
			    of problem messages as close to the border of the
			    ADMD as possible.  This enables, for example,
			    rejections of messages at the SMTP level rather
			    than generating a DSN internally.  Thus, doing any
			    of the authentication or reputation work
			    exclusively at the MUA or intermediate MTA renders
			    this desire unattainable. </t>

			<t> Border MTAs are more likely to have direct access
			    to external sources of authentication or reputation
			    information since modern MUAs are more likely to
			    be heavily firewalled.  Thus, some MUAs might not
			    even be able to complete the task of performing
			    authentication or reputation evaluations without
			    complex proxy configurations or similar
			    burdens. </t>

			<t> MUAs rely upon the upstream MTAs within their trust
			    boundaries to make correct (as much as that is
			    possible) evaluations about the message's envelope,
			    header and content.  Thus, MUAs don't need to
			    know how to do the work that upstream MTAs do;
			    they only need the results of that work. </t>

			<t> Evaluations about the quality of a message,
			    from simple token matching (e.g., a list of
			    preferred DNS domains) to cryptanalysis (e.g.,
			    public/private key work), are at least a
			    little bit expensive and thus should be minimized.
			    To that end, performing those tests at the border
			    MTA is far preferred to doing that work at each
			    MUA that handles a message.  If an ADMD's
			    environment adheres to common messaging protocols,
			    a reputation query or an authentication check
			    performed by a border MTA would return the same
			    result as the same query performed by an MUA.  By
			    contrast, in an environment where the MUA does the
			    work, a message arriving for multiple recipients
			    would thus cause authentication or reputation
			    evaluation to be done more than once for the same
			    message (i.e., at each MUA) causing needless
			    amplification of resource use and creating a
			    possible denial-of-service attack vector. </t>

			<t> Minimizing change is good.  As new authentication
			    and reputation methods emerge, the list of methods
			    supported by this header field would presumably be
			    extended.  If MUAs simply consume the contents of
			    this header field rather than actually attempting
			    to do authentication and/or reputation work, then
			    MUAs only need to learn to parse this header field
			    once; emergence of new methods requires only a
			    configuration change at the MUAs and software
			    changes at the MTAs (which are presumably fewer in
			    number).  When choosing to implement these
			    functions in MTAs vs MUAs, the issues of
			    individual flexibility, infrastructure inertia and
			    scale of effort must be considered.  It is
			    typically easier to change a single MUA than an
			    MTA because the modification affects fewer users
			    and can be pursued with less care.  However,
			    changing many MUAs is more effort than changing a
			    smaller number of MTAs.  </t>

			<t> For decisions affecting message delivery and
			    display, assessment based on authentication and
			    reputation is best performed close to the time of
			    message transit, as a message makes its journey
			    toward a user's inbox, not afterwards.  DKIM keys
			    and IP address reputations, etc., can change over
			    time or even become invalid, and users can take
			    a long time to read a message once delivered.
			    The value of this work thus degrades, perhaps
			    quickly, once the delivery process has completed.
			    This seriously diminishes the value of this work
			    when done other than at MTAs. </t>

		<t> Many operational choices are possible within an ADMD,
		    including the venue for performing authentication and/or
		    reputation assessment.  The current specification does not
		    dictate any of those choices.  Rather, it facilitates those
		    cases in which information produced by one stage of
		    analysis needs to be transported with the message to the
		    next stage.  </t>
