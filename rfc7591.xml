    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines mechanisms for dynamically registering
      OAuth 2.0 clients with authorization servers. Registration requests send
      a set of desired client metadata values to the authorization server. The
      resulting registration responses return a client identifier to use at
      the authorization server and the client metadata values registered for
      the client. The client can then use this registration information to
      communicate with the authorization server using the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
      This specification also defines a set of common client metadata fields
      and values for clients to use during registration.</t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>In order for an <xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0</xref> client to
      utilize an OAuth 2.0 authorization server, the client needs specific
      information to interact with the server, including an OAuth 2.0 client
      identifier to use at that server. This specification describes how an
      OAuth 2.0 client can be dynamically registered with an authorization
      server to obtain this information.</t>


      <t>As part of the registration process, this specification also defines
      a mechanism for the client to present the authorization server with a
      set of metadata, such as a set of valid redirection URIs. 

   This metadata can either be communicated in a self-asserted fashion or as
   a set of metadata called a software statement, which is digitally
   signed or protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC); in the case of a software statement, the issuer is vouching for
      the validity of the data about the client.</t>

      <t>Traditionally, registration of a client with an authorization server
      is performed manually. The mechanisms defined in this specification can
      be used either for a client to dynamically register itself with
      authorization servers or for a client developer to programmatically
      register the client with authorization servers. Multiple applications
      using OAuth 2.0 have previously developed mechanisms for accomplishing
      such registrations. This specification generalizes the registration
      mechanisms defined by <xref target="OpenID.Registration">"OpenID
      Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0"</xref> and used by
      <xref target="UMA-Core">"User Managed Access (UMA)
      Profile of OAuth 2.0"</xref> in a way that is compatible
      with both, while being applicable to a wider set of OAuth 2.0 use
      cases.</t>

        <t>This specification uses the terms "access token", "authorization
        code", "authorization endpoint", "authorization grant", "authorization
        server", "client", "client identifier", "client secret", "grant type",
        "protected resource", "redirection URI", "refresh token", "resource

        defined by <xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0</xref> and uses the term
        "Claim" defined by <xref target="RFC7519">JSON Web Token
        (JWT)</xref>.</t>

        <t>This specification defines the following terms:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Client Software"><vspace/>Software implementing an
            OAuth 2.0 client.</t>

            <t hangText="Client Instance"><vspace/>A deployed instance of a
            piece of client software.</t>

            <t hangText="Client Developer"><vspace/>The person or organization
            that builds a client software package and prepares it for
            distribution. At the time the client is built, the developer is
            often not aware of who the deploying service provider
            organizations will be. Client developers will need to use dynamic
            registration when they are unable to predict aspects of the
            software, such as the deployment URLs, at compile time. For
            instance, this can occur when the software API publisher and the
            deploying organization are not the same.</t>

            <t hangText="Client Registration Endpoint"><vspace/>OAuth 2.0
            endpoint through which a client can be registered at an
            authorization server. The means by which the URL for this endpoint
            is obtained are out of scope for this specification.</t>

            <t hangText="Initial Access Token"><vspace/>OAuth 2.0 access token
            optionally issued by an authorization server to a developer or
            client and used to authorize calls to the client registration
            endpoint. The type and format of this token are likely
            service specific and are out of scope for this specification. The
            means by which the authorization server issues this token as well
            as the means by which the registration endpoint validates this
            token are out of scope for this specification. Use of an initial
            access token is required when the authorization server limits the
            parties that can register a client.</t>

            <t hangText="Deployment Organization"><vspace/>An administrative
            security domain under which a software API (service) is deployed
            and protected by an OAuth 2.0 framework. In some OAuth scenarios,
            the deployment organization and the software API publisher are the
            same. In these cases, the deploying organization will often have a
            close relationship with client software developers. In many other
            cases, the definer of the service may be an independent
            third-party publisher or a standards organization. When working to
            a published specification for an API, the client software
            developer is unable to have a prior relationship with the
            potentially many deployment organizations deploying the software
            API (service).</t>

            <t hangText="Software API Deployment"><vspace/>A deployed instance
            of a software API that is protected by OAuth 2.0 (a protected
            resource) in a particular deployment organization domain. For any
            particular software API, there may be one or more deployments. A
            software API deployment typically has an associated OAuth 2.0
            authorization server as well as a client registration endpoint.
            The means by which endpoints are obtained are out of scope for
            this specification.</t>

            <t hangText="Software API Publisher"><vspace/>The organization
            that defines a particular web-accessible API that may be deployed
            in one or more deployment environments. A publisher may be any
            standards body, commercial, public, private, or open source
            organization that is responsible for publishing and distributing
            software and API specifications that may be protected via OAuth
            2.0. In some cases, a software API publisher and a client
            developer may be the same organization. At the time of publication
            of a web-accessible API, the software publisher often does not
            have a prior relationship with the deploying organizations.</t>

            <t hangText="Software Statement"><vspace/>A digitally signed or
            MACed JSON Web Token (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519"/> that asserts
            metadata values about the client software. In some cases, a
            software statement will be issued directly by the client
            developer. In other cases, a software statement will be issued by
            a third-party organization for use by the client developer. In
            both cases, the trust relationship the authorization server has
            with the issuer of the software statement is intended to be used
            as an input to the evaluation of whether the registration request
            is accepted. A software statement can be presented to an
            authorization server as part of a client registration request.</t>

          registered. Unlike <spanx style="verb">client_id</spanx>,
          which is issued by the authorization server and SHOULD vary
          between instances, the <spanx

          style="verb">software_id</spanx> SHOULD remain the same
          across multiple updates or versions of the same piece of
          software. The value of this field is not intended to be
          human readable and is usually opaque to the client and
          authorization server.</t>

          <t hangText="software_version"><vspace/>A version identifier string
          for the client software identified by <spanx style="verb">software_id</spanx>.
          The value of the <spanx style="verb">software_version</spanx> SHOULD
          change on any update to the client software identified by the same
          <spanx style="verb">software_id</spanx>. The value of this field is
          intended to be compared using string equality matching and no other
          comparison semantics are defined by this specification. The value of
          this field is outside the scope of this specification, but it is
          not intended to be human readable and is usually opaque to the
          client and authorization server. The definition of what constitutes
          an update to client software that would trigger a change to this
          value is specific to the software itself and is outside the scope of
          this specification.</t>

      <t>Extensions and profiles of this specification can expand this list
      with metadata names and descriptions registered in accordance with the
      IANA Considerations in <xref target="IANA"/> of this document. The
      authorization server MUST ignore any client metadata sent by the client
      that it does not understand (for instance, by silently removing unknown
      metadata from the client's registration record during processing). The
      authorization server MAY reject any requested client metadata values by
      replacing requested values with suitable defaults as described in <xref
      target="ClientInfoResponse"/> or by returning an error response as
      described in <xref target="ClientRegistrationError"/>.</t>

      <t>Client metadata values can be either communicated directly in the
      body of a registration request, as described in <xref
      target="RegistrationRequest"/>, or included as claims in a software
      statement, as described in <xref target="SoftwareStatement"/>;  a
      mixture of both is also possible. If the same client metadata name is present in both
      locations and the software statement is trusted by the authorization
      server, the value of a claim in the software statement MUST take
      precedence.</t>

        <t>The <spanx style="verb">grant_types</spanx> and <spanx
        style="verb">response_types</spanx> values described above are
        partially orthogonal, as they refer to arguments passed to different
        endpoints in the OAuth protocol. However, they are related in that the
        <spanx style="verb">grant_types</spanx> available to a client
        influence the <spanx style="verb">response_types</spanx> that the
        client is allowed to use, and vice versa. For instance, a <spanx
        style="verb">grant_types</spanx> value that includes <spanx
        style="verb">authorization_code</spanx> implies a <spanx style="verb">response_types</spanx>
        value that includes <spanx style="verb">code</spanx>, as both values
        are defined as part of the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant. As
        such, a server supporting these fields SHOULD take steps to ensure
        that a client cannot register itself into an inconsistent state, for

      <section anchor="HumanReadableClientMetadata"
               title="Human-Readable Client Metadata">
        <t>Human-readable client metadata values and client metadata values
        that reference human-readable values MAY be represented in multiple
        languages and scripts. For example, the values of fields such as
        <spanx style="verb">client_name</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">tos_uri</spanx>,
        <spanx style="verb">policy_uri</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">logo_uri</spanx>,
        and <spanx style="verb">client_uri</spanx> might have multiple
        locale-specific values in some client registrations to facilitate use
        in different locations.</t>

        <t>To specify the languages and scripts, <xref
        target="RFC5646">BCP 47</xref> language tags are added to client
        metadata member names, delimited by a <spanx style="verb">#</spanx> character. Since <xref
        target="RFC7159">JSON</xref> member names are case sensitive, it is
        RECOMMENDED that language tag values used in Claim Names be spelled
        using the character case with which they are registered in the <xref
        target="IANA.Language">"IANA Language Subtag" registry</xref>. In
        particular, normally language names are spelled with lowercase
        characters, region names are spelled with uppercase characters, and
        languages are spelled with mixed-case characters. However, since BCP 47
        language tag values are case-insensitive, implementations SHOULD
        interpret the language tag values supplied in a case insensitive
        manner. Per the recommendations in BCP 47, language tag values used in
        metadata member names should only be as specific as necessary. For
        instance, using <spanx style="verb">fr</spanx> might be sufficient in
        many contexts, rather than <spanx style="verb">fr-CA</spanx> or <spanx
        style="verb">fr-FR</spanx>.</t>

        <t>For example, a client could represent its name in English as <spanx
        style="verb">"client_name#en": "My Client"</spanx> and its name in
        Japanese as <spanx style="verb">"client_name#ja-Jpan-JP": "\u30AF\u30E9\u30A4\u30A2\u30F3\u30C8\u540D"</spanx>
        within the same registration request. The authorization server MAY
        display any or all of these names to the resource owner during the
        authorization step, choosing which name to display based on system
        configuration, user preferences or other factors.</t>

        <t>If any human-readable field is sent without a language tag, parties
        using it MUST NOT make any assumptions about the language, character
        set, or script of the string value, and the string value MUST be used
        as is wherever it is presented in a user interface. To facilitate
        interoperability, it is RECOMMENDED that clients and servers use a
        human-readable field without any language tags in addition to any
        language-specific fields, and it is RECOMMENDED that any
        human-readable fields sent without language tags contain values
        suitable for display on a wide variety of systems.</t>

        <t>Implementer's Note: Many JSON libraries make it possible to
        reference members of a JSON object as members of an object construct
        in the native programming environment of the library. However, while
        the <spanx style="verb">#</spanx> character is a valid character
        inside of a JSON object's member names, it is not a valid character
        for use in an object member name in many programming environments.
        Therefore, implementations will need to use alternative access forms
        for these claims. For instance, in JavaScript, if one parses the JSON
        as follows, <spanx style="verb">var j = JSON.parse(json);</spanx>,
        then as a workaround the member <spanx style="verb">client_name#en-us</spanx>
        can be accessed using the JavaScript syntax <spanx style="verb">j["client_name#en-us"]</spanx>.</t>

      <section anchor="SoftwareStatement" title="Software Statement">
        <t>A software statement is a JSON Web Token (JWT) <xref
        target="RFC7519"/> that asserts metadata values about the client
        software as a bundle. A set of claims that can be used in a software
        statement are defined in <xref target="ClientMetadata"/>. When
        presented to the authorization server as part of a client registration
        request, the software statement MUST be digitally signed or MACed
        using <xref target="RFC7515">JSON Web Signature (JWS)</xref> and MUST contain an <spanx
        style="verb">iss</spanx> (issuer) claim denoting the party attesting
        to the claims in the software statement. It is RECOMMENDED that
        software statements be digitally signed using the <spanx style="verb">RS256</spanx>
        signature algorithm, although particular applications MAY specify the
        use of different algorithms. It is RECOMMENDED that software

        <t>The software statement is typically distributed with all instances 
   of a client application. The means by which a client or developer 
   obtains a software statement are outside the scope of this 
   specification.  Some common methods could include a client developer 
   generating a client-specific JWT by registering with a software 
   API publisher to obtain a software statement for a class of clients.</t>

        <t>In some cases, authorization servers MAY choose to accept a software

   required in this case, are outside the scope of this specification.</t>

    <section anchor="RegistrationEndpoint"
             title="Client Registration Endpoint">
      <t>The client registration endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 endpoint defined in
      this document that is designed to allow a client to be registered with
      the authorization server. The client registration endpoint MUST accept
      HTTP POST messages with request parameters encoded in the entity body
      using the <spanx style="verb">application/json</spanx> format. The
      client registration endpoint MUST be protected by a transport-layer
      security mechanism, as described in <xref target="Security"/>.</t>

      <t>The client registration endpoint MAY be an <xref
      target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0</xref> protected
      resource and it MAY accept an initial access token in the form of an OAuth 2.0 access token to limit registration to
      only previously authorized parties. The method by which the initial
      access token is obtained by the client or developer is generally
      out of band and is out of scope for this specification. The method by
      which the initial access token is verified and validated by the client
      registration endpoint is out of scope for this specification.</t>

      <t>To support open registration and facilitate wider interoperability,
      the client registration endpoint SHOULD allow registration requests with
      no authorization (which is to say, with no initial access token in the
      request). These requests MAY be rate-limited or otherwise limited to
      prevent a denial-of-service attack on the client registration
      endpoint.</t>

      <section anchor="RegistrationRequest"
               title="Client Registration Request">
        <t>This operation registers a client with the authorization server.
        The authorization server assigns this client a unique client
        identifier, optionally assigns a client secret, and associates the
        metadata provided in the request with the issued client identifier.
        The request includes any client metadata parameters being specified
        for the client during the registration. The authorization server MAY
        provision default values for any items omitted in the client
        metadata.</t>

        <t>To register, the client or developer sends an HTTP POST to the
        client registration endpoint with a content type of <spanx
        style="verb">application/json</spanx>. The HTTP Entity Payload is a
        <xref target="RFC7159">JSON</xref> document consisting of a JSON
        object and all requested client metadata values as top-level members
        of that JSON object.</t>

        <t>For example, if the server supports open registration (with no
        initial access token), the client could send the following
        registration request to the client registration endpoint.</t>

        <figure>

        <t>Alternatively, if the server supports authorized registration, the

        the following authorized registration request to the client
        registration endpoint. Note that the initial access token sent in this

        <t>Upon a successful registration request, the authorization server
        returns a client identifier for the client. The server responds with
        an HTTP 201 Created status code and a body of type <spanx style="verb">application/json</spanx>
        with content as described in <xref target="ClientInfoResponse"/>.</t>


        <t>Upon an unsuccessful registration request, the authorization server
        responds with an error, as described in <xref
        target="ClientRegistrationError"/>.</t>

        <section anchor="ClientInfoResponse"
                 title="Client Information Response">
          <t>The response contains the client identifier as well as the client
          secret, if the client is a confidential client. The response MAY
          contain additional fields as specified by extensions to this
          specification.</t>

          <t><list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="client_id"><vspace/> REQUIRED. OAuth 2.0 client
              identifier string. It SHOULD NOT be currently valid for any
              other registered client, though an authorization server MAY
              issue the same client identifier to multiple instances of a
              registered client at its discretion.</t>

              <t hangText="client_secret"><vspace/> OPTIONAL. OAuth 2.0 client
              secret string. If issued, this MUST be unique for each <spanx
              style="verb">client_id</spanx> and SHOULD be unique for multiple
              instances of a client using the same <spanx style="verb">client_id</spanx>.
              This value is used by confidential clients to authenticate to
              the token endpoint, as described in <xref target="RFC6749">OAuth
              2.0</xref>, Section 2.3.1.</t>

              <t hangText="client_id_issued_at"><vspace/> OPTIONAL.  Time at which the client identifier was issued.  The
      time is represented as the number of seconds from
      1970-01-01T00:00:00Z as measured in UTC until the date/time of
      issuance.</t>

              <t hangText="client_secret_expires_at"><vspace/> REQUIRED if
              <spanx style="verb">client_secret</spanx> is issued.  Time at which the client
      secret will expire or 0 if it will not expire.  The time is
      represented as the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z as
      measured in UTC until the date/time of expiration.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Additionally, the authorization server MUST return all registered
          metadata about this client, including any fields provisioned by the
          authorization server itself. The authorization server MAY reject or
          replace any of the client's requested metadata values submitted
          during the registration and substitute them with suitable values.
          The client or developer can check the values in the response to
          determine if the registration is sufficient for use (e.g., the
          registered <spanx style="verb">token_endpoint_auth_method</spanx> is
          supported by the client software) and determine a course of action
          appropriate for the client software. The response to such a
          situation is out of scope for this specification but could include
          filing a report with the application developer or authorization
          server provider, attempted re-registration with different metadata
          values, or various other methods. For instance, if the server also
          supports a registration management mechanism such as that defined in
          <xref target="RFC7592"/>, the client or
          developer could attempt to update the registration with different
          metadata values. This process could also be aided by a service
          discovery protocol, such as <xref target="OpenID.Discovery"/>, which
          can list a server's capabilities, allowing a client to make a more
          informed registration request. The use of any such management or
          discovery system is optional and outside the scope of this
          specification.</t>

          <t>The successful registration response uses an HTTP 201 Created
          status code with a body of type <spanx style="verb">application/json</spanx>
          consisting of a single <xref target="RFC7159">JSON object</xref>
          with all parameters as top-level members of the object.</t>

          <t>If a software statement was used as part of the registration, its
          value MUST be returned unmodified in the response along with other
          metadata using the <spanx style="verb">software_statement</spanx>
          member name. Client metadata elements used from the software
          statement MUST also be returned directly as top-level client
          metadata values in the registration response (possibly with
          different values, since the values requested and the values used may
          differ).</t>

        <t>This specification establishes the "OAuth Dynamic Client
        Registration Metadata" registry.</t>

        <t>OAuth registration client metadata names and descriptions are
        registered with a Specification Required (<xref target="RFC5226"/>)
        after a two-week review period on the oauth-ext-review@ietf.org
        mailing list, on the advice of one or more Designated Experts.
        However, to allow for the allocation of names prior to publication,
        the Designated Experts may approve registration once they are
        satisfied that such a specification will be published, per <xref
        target="RFC7120"/>.</t>

        <t>Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review should
        use an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to register OAuth Dynamic
        Client Registration Metadata name: example").</t>

        <t>Within the review period, the Designated Experts will either
        approve or deny the registration request, communicating this decision
        to the review list and IANA. Denials should include an explanation
        and, if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request
        successful.</t>

        <t>IANA must only accept registry updates from the Designated
        Experts and should direct all requests for registration to the
        review mailing list.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Since requests to the client registration endpoint result in the
      transmission of clear-text credentials (in the HTTP request and
      response), the authorization server MUST require the use of a
      transport-layer security mechanism when sending requests to the
      registration endpoint. The server MUST support TLS 1.2 <xref
      target="RFC5246"></xref> and MAY support additional
      transport-layer security mechanisms meeting its security requirements. When using
      TLS, the client MUST perform a TLS/SSL server certificate check, per
      <xref target="RFC6125">RFC 6125</xref>. Implementation security
      considerations can be found in <xref target="BCP195">Recommendations
      for Secure Use of TLS and DTLS</xref>.</t>

      <t>For clients that use redirect-based grant types such as <spanx
      style="verb">authorization_code</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">implicit</spanx>,
      authorization servers MUST require clients to register their redirection
      URI values. This can help mitigate attacks where rogue actors inject and
      impersonate a validly registered client and intercept its authorization
      code or tokens through an invalid redirection URI or open redirector.
      Additionally, in order to prevent hijacking of the return values of the
      redirection, registered redirection URI values MUST be one of:</t>


      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>A remote web site protected by TLS (e.g., https://client.example.com/oauth_redirect)</t>

          <t>A web site hosted on the local machine using an HTTP URI (e.g., http://localhost:8080/oauth_redirect)</t>

          <t>A non-HTTP application-specific URL that is available only to the
          client application (e.g., exampleapp://oauth_redirect)</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Public clients MAY register with an authorization server using this
      protocol, if the authorization server's policy allows them. Public
      clients use a <spanx style="verb">none</spanx> value for the <spanx
      style="verb">token_endpoint_auth_method</spanx> metadata field and are
      generally used with the <spanx style="verb">implicit</spanx> grant type.
      Often these clients will be short-lived in-browser applications
      requesting access to a user's resources and access is tied to a user's
      active session at the authorization server. Since such clients often do
      not have long-term storage, it is possible that such clients would need
      to re-register every time the browser application is loaded. To avoid
      the resulting proliferation of dead client identifiers, an authorization
      server MAY decide to expire registrations for existing clients meeting
      certain criteria after a period of time has elapsed. Alternatively, such
      clients could be registered on the server where the in-browser
      application's code is served from, and the client's configuration could be pushed
      to the browser alongside the code.</t>

      <t>Since different OAuth 2.0 grant types have different security and
      usage properties, an authorization server MAY require separate
      registrations for a piece of software to support multiple grant types.
      For instance, an authorization server might require that all clients
      using the <spanx style="verb">authorization_code</spanx> grant type make
      use of a client secret for the <spanx style="verb">token_endpoint_auth_method</spanx>
      but any clients using the <spanx style="verb">implicit</spanx> grant
      type not use any authentication at the token endpoint. In such a
      situation, a server MAY disallow clients from registering for both the
      <spanx style="verb">authorization_code</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">implicit</spanx>
      grant types simultaneously. Similarly, the <spanx style="verb">authorization_code</spanx>
      grant type is used to represent access on behalf of an end-user, but the
      <spanx style="verb">client_credentials</spanx> grant type represents
      access on behalf of the client itself. For security reasons, an
      authorization server could require that different scopes be used for
      these different use cases, and, as a consequence, it MAY disallow these
      two grant types from being registered together by the same client. In
      all of these cases, the authorization server would respond with an
      <spanx style="verb">invalid_client_metadata</spanx> error response.</t>

      <t>Unless used as a claim in a software statement, the authorization
      server MUST treat all client metadata as self-asserted. For instance, a
      rogue client might use the name and logo of a legitimate client that it
      is trying to impersonate. Additionally, a rogue client might try to use
      the software identifier or software version of a legitimate client to
      attempt to associate itself on the authorization server with instances
      of the legitimate client. To counteract this, an authorization server
      MUST take appropriate steps to mitigate this risk by looking at the
      entire registration request and client configuration. For instance, an
      authorization server could issue a warning if the domain/site of the
      logo doesn't match the domain/site of redirection URIs. An authorization
      server could also refuse registration requests from a known software
      identifier that is requesting different redirection URIs or a different
      client URI. An authorization server can also present warning messages to
      end-users about dynamically registered clients in all cases, especially
      if such clients have been recently registered or have not been trusted
      by any users at the authorization server before.</t>

      <t>In a situation where the authorization server is supporting open
      client registration, it must be extremely careful with any URL provided
      by the client that will be displayed to the user (e.g., <spanx
      style="verb">logo_uri</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">tos_uri</spanx>,
      <spanx style="verb">client_uri</spanx>, and <spanx style="verb">policy_uri</spanx>).
      For instance, a rogue client could specify a registration request with a
      reference to a drive-by download in the <spanx style="verb">policy_uri</spanx>,
      enticing the user to click on it during the authorization. The
      authorization server SHOULD check to see if the <spanx style="verb">logo_uri</spanx>,
      <spanx style="verb">tos_uri</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">client_uri</spanx>,
      and <spanx style="verb">policy_uri</spanx> have the same host and scheme
      as the those defined in the array of <spanx style="verb">redirect_uris</spanx>
      and that all of these URIs resolve to valid web pages. Since these URI
      values that are intended to be displayed to the user at the
      authorization page, the authorization server SHOULD protect the user
      from malicious content hosted at the URLs where possible. For instance,
      before presenting the URLs to the user at the authorization page, the
      authorization server could download the content hosted at the URLs,
      check the content against a malware scanner and blacklist filter,
      determine whether or not there is mixed secure and non-secure content at
      the URL, and other possible server-side mitigations. Note that the
      content in these URLs can change at any time and the authorization
      server cannot provide complete confidence in the safety of the URLs, but
      these practices could help. To further mitigate this kind of threat, the
      authorization server can also warn the user that the URL links have been
      provided by a third party, should be treated with caution, and are not
      hosted by the authorization server itself. For instance, instead of
      providing the links directly in an HTML anchor, the authorization server
      can direct the user to an interstitial warning page before allowing the
      user to continue to the target URL.</t>

      <t>Clients MAY use both the direct JSON object and the JWT-encoded
      software statement to present client metadata to the authorization
      server as part of the registration request. A software statement is
      cryptographically protected and represents claims made by the issuer of
      the statement, while the JSON object represents the self-asserted claims
      made by the client or developer directly. If the software statement is
      valid and signed by an acceptable authority (such as the software API
      publisher), the values of client metadata within the software statement
      MUST take precedence over those metadata values presented in the plain
      JSON object, which could have been intercepted and modified.</t>

      <t>Like all metadata values, the software statement is an item that is
      self-asserted by the client, even though its contents have been
      digitally signed or MACed by the issuer of the software statement. As
      such, presentation of the software statement is not sufficient in most
      cases to fully identify a piece of client software. An initial access
      token, in contrast, does not necessarily contain information about a
      particular piece of client software but instead represents authorization
      to use the registration endpoint. An authorization server MUST consider
      the full registration request, including the software statement, initial
      access token, and JSON client metadata values, when deciding whether to
      honor a given registration request.</t>

      <t>If an authorization server receives a registration request for a
      client that is not intended to have multiple instances registered
      simultaneously and the authorization server can infer a duplication of
      registration (e.g., it uses the same <spanx style="verb">software_id</spanx>
      and <spanx style="verb">software_version</spanx> values as another
      existing client), the server SHOULD treat the new registration as being
      suspect and reject the registration. It is possible that the new client
      is trying to impersonate the existing client in order to trick users
      into authorizing it, or that the original registration is no longer
      valid. The details of managing this situation are specific to the
      authorization server deployment and outside the scope of this
      specification.</t>

      <t>Since a client identifier is a public value that can be used to
      impersonate a client at the authorization endpoint, an authorization
      server that decides to issue the same client identifier to multiple
      instances of a registered client needs to be very particular about the
      circumstances under which this occurs. For instance, the authorization
      server can limit a given client identifier to clients using the same
      redirect-based flow and the same redirection URIs. An authorization
      server SHOULD NOT issue the same client secret to multiple instances of
      a registered client, even if they are issued the same client identifier,
      or else the client secret could be leaked, allowing malicious impostors
      to impersonate a confidential client.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t>As the protocol described in this specification deals almost
      exclusively with information about software and not people, there
      are very few privacy concerns for its use. The notable exception is the
      <spanx style="verb">contacts</spanx> field as defined in <xref
      target="ClientMetadata"/>, which contains contact
      information for the developers or other parties responsible for the
      client software. These values are intended to be displayed to end-users
      and will be available to the administrators of the authorization server.
      As such, the developer may wish to provide an email address or other
      contact information expressly dedicated to the purpose of supporting the
      client instead of using their personal or professional addresses.
      Alternatively, the developer may wish to provide a collective email
      address for the client to allow for continuing contact and support of
      the client software after the developer moves on and someone else takes
      over that responsibility.</t>

      <t>In general, the metadata for a client, such as the client name and
      software identifier, are common across all instances of a piece of
      client software and therefore pose no privacy issues for end-users.
      Client identifiers, on the other hand, are often unique to a specific
      instance of a client. For clients such as web sites that are used by
      many users, there may not be significant privacy concerns regarding the
      client identifier, but for clients such as native applications that are
      installed on a single end-user's device, the client identifier could be
      uniquely tracked during OAuth 2.0 transactions and its use tied to that
      single end-user. However, as the client software still needs to be
      authorized by a resource owner through an OAuth 2.0 authorization grant,
      this type of tracking can occur whether or not the client identifier is
      unique by correlating the authenticated resource owner with the
      requesting client identifier.</t>

      <t>Note that clients are forbidden by this specification from creating
      their own client identifier. If the client were able to do so, an
      individual client instance could be tracked across multiple colluding
      authorization servers, leading to privacy and security issues.
      Additionally, client identifiers are generally issued uniquely per
      registration request, even for the same instance of software. In this
      way, an application could marginally improve privacy by registering
      multiple times and appearing to be completely separate applications.
      However, this technique does incur significant usability cost in the
      form of requiring multiple authorizations per resource owner and is
      therefore unlikely to be used in practice.</t>

<abstract><t>User-Managed Access (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0.  UMA defines how resource owners can control protected-resource access by clients operated by arbitrary requesting parties, where the resources reside on any number of resource servers, and where a centralized authorization server governs access based on resource owner policies.</t></abstract>

    <section anchor="UseCases" title="Use Cases">
      <t>This appendix describes different ways that this specification can be
      utilized, including describing some of the choices that may need to be
      made. Some of the choices are independent and can be used in
      combination, whereas some of the choices are interrelated.</t>

      <section anchor="OpenOrProtected"
               title="Open versus Protected Dynamic Client Registration">
        <section anchor="OpenRegistration"
                 title="Open Dynamic Client Registration">
          <t>Authorization servers that support open registration allow
          registrations to be made with no initial access token. This allows
          all client software to register with the authorization server.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="ProtectedRegistration"
                 title="Protected Dynamic Client Registration">
          <t>Authorization servers that support protected registration require
          that an initial access token be used when making registration
          requests. While the method by which a client or developer receives
          this initial access token and the method by which the authorization
          server validates this initial access token are out of scope for this
          specification, a common approach is for the developer to use a
          manual preregistration portal at the authorization server that
          issues an initial access token to the developer.</t>

        <section anchor="NoSoftwareStatement"
                 title="Registration without a Software Statement">
          <t>When a software statement is not used in the registration
          request, the authorization server must be willing to use client
          metadata values without them being digitally signed or MACed (and
          thereby attested to) by any authority. (Note that this choice is
          independent of the Open versus Protected choice, and that an initial
          access token is another possible form of attestation.)</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="WithSoftwareStatement"
                 title="Registration with a Software Statement">
          <t>A software statement can be used in a registration request to
          provide attestation by an authority for a set of client metadata
          values. This can be useful when the authorization server wants to
          restrict registration to client software attested to by a set of
          authorities or when it wants to know that multiple registration
          requests refer to the same piece of client software.</t>

        <section anchor="ByClient" title="Registration by the Client">
          <t>In some use cases, client software will dynamically register
          itself with an authorization server to obtain a client identifier
          and other information needed to interact with the authorization
          server. In this case, no client identifier for the authorization
          server is packaged with the client software.</t>

        <section anchor="ByDeveloper" title="Registration by the Developer">
          <t>In some cases, the developer (or development software being used
          by the developer) will preregister the client software with the
          authorization server or a set of authorization servers. In this
          case, the client identifier value(s) for the authorization server(s)
          can be packaged with the client software.</t>

        <section anchor="IDPerInstance"
                 title="Client ID per Client Software Instance">
          <t>In some cases, each deployed instance of a piece of client
          software will dynamically register and obtain distinct client
          identifier values. This can be advantageous, for instance, if the
          code flow is being used, as it also enables each client instance to
          have its own client secret. This can be useful for native clients,
          which cannot maintain the secrecy of a client secret value packaged
          with the software, but which may be able to maintain the secrecy of
          a per-instance client secret.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="SharedID"
                 title="Client ID Shared among All Instances of Client Software">
          <t>In some cases, each deployed instance of a piece of client
          software will share a common client identifier value. For instance,
          this is often the case for in-browser clients using the implicit
          flow, when no client secret is involved. Particular authorization
          servers might choose, for instance, to maintain a mapping between
          software statement values and client identifier values, and return
          the same client identifier value for all registration requests for a
          particular piece of software. The circumstances under which an
          authorization server would do so, and the specific software
          statement characteristics required in this case, are beyond the
          scope of this specification.</t>

        <section anchor="Stateful" title="Stateful Client Registration">
          <t>In some cases, authorization servers will maintain state about
          registered clients, typically indexing this state using the client
          identifier value. This state would typically include the client
          metadata values associated with the client registration, and
          possibly other state specific to the authorization server's
          implementation. When stateful registration is used, operations to
          support retrieving and/or updating this state may be supported. One
          possible set of operations upon stateful registrations is described
          in <xref target="RFC7592"/>.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="Stateless" title="Stateless Client Registration">
          <t>In some cases, authorization servers will be implemented in a
          manner the enables them to not maintain any local state about
          registered clients. One means of doing this is to encode all the
          registration state in the returned client identifier value, and
          possibly encrypting the state to the authorization server to
          maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the state.</t>
