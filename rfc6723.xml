    <abstract>

     <t>The control-word negotiation mechanism specified in RFC 4447 has a
problem when a PE (Provider Edge) changes the preference for the use of the control word from NOT PREFERRED to PREFERRED. This document updates RFC 4447 and RFC 6073 by adding the Label Request message to resolve this control-word negotiation issue for single-segment and multi-segment pseudowires.</t>

<section title="Introduction">
<t>The control-word negotiation mechanism specified in <xref target="RFC4447"
/>, Section 6.2, encounters a problem when a PE changes the
preference for the use of the control word from NOT PREFERRED to
PREFERRED. <xref target="RFC4447" /> specifies that if both endpoints prefer
the use of the control word, then the pseudowire control word should be
used. However, in the case where a PE changes its preference from NOT PREFERRED
to PREFERRED and both ends of the PW (pseudowire) PE have the use of control
word set as PREFERRED, an incorrect negotiated result of the control word as
&quot;not used&quot; occurs. This document updates the control-word negotiation
mechanism in <xref target="RFC4447" /> by adding a Label Request message to
resolve this negotiation issue for single-segment PW. Multi-segment PW in <xref
target="RFC6073" /> inherits the control-word negotiation mechanism in <xref
target="RFC4447" />, and this document updates <xref target="RFC6073" /> by
adding the processing of Label Request message on the S-PE (Switching Provider Edge). When the PE changes the preference for the use of control word from PREFERRED to NOT PREFERRED, it should follow <xref target="RFC4447" />, and there is no problem.</t>
</section>

<section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
</section>

<section title="Problem Statement">
<t><xref target="RFC4447" />, Section 6, describes the control-word negotiation
mechanism. Each PW endpoint has a configurable parameter that specifies whether
the use of the control word is PREFERRED or NOT PREFERRED.  

   During
   control-word negotiation, if one PE advertises a C bit set to 0 in
   the Label Mapping message with its locally configured use of control
   word as PREFERRED, and a corresponding peer PE changes its use of
   control word from NOT PREFERRED to PREFERRED, this causes an incorrect
   negotiated control-word result of "not used".
</t>

<t>The following case will describe the negotiation problem in detail:</t>

<t>
<list style='numbers'>
  <t>Initially, the use of control word on PE1 is configured as PREFERRED, and on PE2 as NOT PREFERRED.</t>
  <t>The negotiation result for the control word of this PW is not used, and ultimately PE1 sends the Label Mapping message with C bit set to 0 according to <xref target="RFC4447" />, Section 6.2.</t>
  <t>PE2 then changes its use of control-word configuration from NOT PREFERRED to PREFERRED, by deleting PW configuration with NOT PREFERRED use of control word, and configuring the PW again with PREFERRED use of control word.</t>
  <t>PE2 will then send the Label Withdraw message to PE1, and correspondingly will receive the Label Release message from PE1.</t>
  <t>According to the control-word negotiation mechanism, the previously
received Label Mapping message on PE2 from PE1 carries the C bit set to 0;
therefore, PE2 will still send the Label Mapping message with the C bit set to 0.</t>
  </list>
</t>

  <t>The negotiation result for the control word is still not used, even though the use of control-word configuration on both PE1 and PE2 are PREFERRED.</t>

</section>
 
<section title="Control-Word Renegotiation by Label Request Message">

<t>The control-word negotiation mechanism in <xref target="RFC4447" />, Section 6, is updated to add the Label Request message described in this section.</t>
<t>The renegotiation process begins when the local PE has received the remote
Label Mapping message with the C bit set to 0, and at the point its use of
control word is changed from NOT PREFERRED to PREFERRED. The following additional procedure will be carried out:

<list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
  <t hangText="i."> The local PE MUST send a Label Release message to remote
PE. If local PE has previously sent a Label Mapping message, it MUST send a
Label Withdraw message to remote PE and wait until it has received a Label
Release message from the remote PE. Note: the above-mentioned sending of the
Label Release message and Label Withdraw message does not require a specific sequence.</t>
  <t hangText="ii."> The local PE MUST send a Label Request message to the peer PE, and then MUST wait until it receives a Label Mapping message containing the peer&apos;s current configured preference for use of control word.</t>
  <t hangText="iii."> After receiving the remote peer PE Label Mapping message
with the C bit, the local PE MUST follow the procedures defined in <xref target="RFC4447" />, Section 6, when sending its Label Mapping message.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>The remote PE will follow <xref target="RFC4447" />, and once the remote PE
has successfully processed the Label Withdraw message and Label Release
message, it will reset its use of control word with the locally configured
preference. Then, the remote PE will send a Label Mapping message with locally configured preference for use of control word as a response to Label Request message as specified in <xref target="RFC5036" />.</t>


<t>Note: for the local PE, before processing new request to change the configuration, the above message-exchanging process should be finished. The FEC
(Forwarding Equivalence Class) element in the Label Request message should be
the PE's local PW FEC element. As a response to the Label Request message, the
peer PE should send a Label Mapping message with its own local PW FEC element. The Label Request message format and procedure is described in <xref target="RFC5036" />.</t>


<section title="Control-Word Renegotiation for Multi-Segment PW">
<t>The multi-segment PW case for a T-PE (Terminating Provider Edge) operates
similarly as the PE in single-segment PW described in the above section.  An
initial passive role is defined in <xref target="RFC6073" /> for the S-PE when
processing of the Label Mapping message. <xref target="RFC6073" /> is updated
by applying this passive role to the processing of Label Request message. When
an S-PE receives a Label Request message from one of its adjacent PEs (which
may be an S-PE or another T-PE), it MUST send a matching Label Request message to other adjacent PE (again, it may be an S-PE or a T-PE). This is necessary since an S-PE does not have complete information of the interface parameter field in the FEC advertisement. When the S-PE receives a Label Release message from remote PE, it MUST send a corresponding Label Release message to the other remote PE when it holds a label for the PW from the remote PE.</t>

<t>Note: because the local T-PE will send a Label Withdraw message before
sending a Label Request message to the remote peer, the S-PE MUST process the
Label Withdraw message before the Label Request message.  When the S-PE
receives the Label Withdraw message, it should process this message to send a
Label Release message as a response and a Label Withdraw message to an upstream S-PE/T-PE. The S-PE will then process the next LDP message, e.g. the Label Request message.</t>


<t>
   When the local PE changes the use of control word from PREFERRED to
   NOT PREFERRED, the local PE would then renegotiate the control
   word so that it is not used by deleting the PW configuration with 
   PREFERRED use of control word, and configuring the PW again with 
   NOT PREFERRED use of control word.
All of these procedures have been defined in <xref target="RFC4447" />, Section 5.4.1.</t>
<t>The diagram in <xref target="App_Cbit_Handling"/> of this document updates the control-word negotiation diagram in <xref target="RFC4447" /> Appendix A.</t>

</section>

<section title="Control-Word Renegotiation Use Case">
<t>The procedure of PE1 and PE2 for the use case in <xref target="Fig_Case"/> will become as follows:
<list style='numbers'>
  <t>PE2 changes locally configured preference for use of control word to PREFERRED.</t>
  <t>PE2 will then send the Release messages to PE1. PE2 will also send the Label Withdraw message, and wait until it has received the Label Release message from PE1.</t>
  <t>PE1 will send the Label Release message in response to the Label Withdraw message from PE2. After processing the Label Release from PE2, PE1 will then reset the use of control word to the locally configured preference as PREFERRED.</t>
  <t>Upon receipt of the Label Release message from PE1, PE2 will send the Label Request message to PE1, and proceed to wait until a Label Mapping message is received.</t>
  <t>PE1 will send a Label Mapping message with the C bit set to 1 again to PE2 in response to the Label Request message.</t>
  <t>PE2 receives the Label Mapping message from PE1 and gets the remote label
binding information.  PE2 will wait for the PE1 Label Mapping message before
sending its Label Mapping message with the C bit set.</t>
  <t>PE2 will send the Label Mapping to PE1 with C bit set to 1, and follow procedures defined in <xref target="RFC4447" />, Section 6.</t>
  </list> 
</t>

<t>While it is assumed that PE1 is configured to prefer the use of the control
word, in step 5, if PE1 doesn&apos;t prefer or support the control word, PE1
would then send the Label Mapping message with the C bit set to 0. As a result,
PE2 in step 7 would send a Label Mapping message with the C bit set 0 as per <xref target="RFC4447" />, Section 6.</t>
<t>By sending a Label Request message, PE2 will get the locally configured preference for use of control word of peer PE1 in the received Label Mapping message.  By using the new C bit from the Label Mapping message received from peer PE1 and the locally configured preference for use of control word, PE2 should determine the use of PW control word according to <xref target="RFC4447" />, Section 6.</t>  

</section>
</section>

<section title="Backward Compatibility">
<t>Since control-word negotiation mechanism is updated by adding the Label Request
message, and still follows the basic procedure described in <xref
target="RFC4447" />, Section 6, this document is fully compatible with existing
implementations. For single-segment pseudowire, the remote PE (PE1 in <xref
target="Fig_Case"/>) which already implements <xref target="RFC4447" />, and
the Label Request message as defined in <xref target="RFC5036" /> could be
compatible with the PE (PE2 in <xref target="Fig_Case"/>) following the mechanism of this
document. For the multi-segment pseudowire, the T-PE is the same as PE in single-segment pseudowire; the S-PE should be upgraded with the mechanism defined in this document.</t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t> The security considerations specified in <xref target="RFC4447" /> and <xref target="RFC6073" /> also apply to this document, and this document does not introduce any additional security constraints.</t>
