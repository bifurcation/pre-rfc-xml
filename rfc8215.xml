      <t>
      This document reserves 64:ff9b:1::/48 for local use within domains that
      enable IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanisms. This facilitates the
      coexistence of multiple IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanisms in the same
      network without requiring the use of a Network-Specific Prefix assigned
      from the operator's allocated global unicast address space.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
      <t>
      This document uses the following terms:
      </t>
      <t>
      <list style="hanging">
       <t hangText="Network-Specific Prefix (NSP)"><vspace/>A globally unique
       prefix assigned by a network operator for use with an IPv4/IPv6
       translation mechanism <xref target="RFC6052"/>.</t>
       <t hangText="Well-Known Prefix (WKP)"><vspace/>The prefix 64:ff9b::/96,
       which is reserved for use with the <xref target="RFC6052"/> IPv4/IPv6
       address translation algorithms.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="problem_statement" title="Problem Statement">
      <t>
      Since the WKP 64:ff9b::/96 was reserved by <xref target="RFC6052"/>,
      several new IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanisms have been defined by the
      IETF, such as those defined in <xref target="RFC6146"/> and <xref target="RFC7915"/>.
      These mechanisms target various different use cases. An operator might
      therefore wish to make use of several of them simultaneously.
      </t>

      <t>
      The WKP is reserved specifically for use with the algorithms specified
      in <xref target="RFC6052"/>. More recent RFCs describe IPv4/IPv6
      translation mechanisms that use different algorithms. An operator
      deploying such mechanisms cannot make use of the WKP in a legitimate
      fashion.
      </t>
      <t>
      Also, because the WKP is a /96, an operator preferring to use the WKP
      over an NSP can do so for only one of their IPv4/IPv6 translation
      mechanisms. 
All others must necessarily use an NSP.
      </t>
      <t>
      Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC6052"/> imposes certain restrictions on
      the use of the WKP, such as forbidding its use in combination with <xref
      target="RFC1918">private IPv4 addresses</xref>. These restrictions
      might conflict with the operator's desired use of an IPv4/IPv6
      translation mechanism.
      </t>
      <t>
      In summary, there is a need for a local-use prefix that facilitates the
      coexistence of multiple IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanisms in a single
      network domain, as well as the deployment of translation mechanisms that
      do not use the <xref target="RFC6052"/> algorithms or adhere to its
      usage restrictions.
      </t>

    <section anchor="choice" title="Why 64:ff9b:1::/48?">
      <section anchor="prefix_length" title="Prefix Length">
        <t>
        One of the primary goals of this document is to facilitate multiple
        simultaneous deployments of IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanisms in a
        single network. The first criterion is therefore that the prefix
        length chosen must be shorter than the prefix length used by any
        individual translation mechanism.
        </t>
        <t>
        The second criterion is that the prefix length chosen is a multiple of
        16. This ensures the prefix ends on a colon boundary when representing
        it in text, easing operator interaction with it.
        </t>
        <t>
        The <xref target="RFC6052"/> algorithms specifies IPv4/IPv6
        translation prefixes as short as /32. In order to facilitate multiple
        instances of translation mechanisms using /32s, while at the same time
        aligning on a 16-bit boundary, it would be necessary to reserve a /16.
        Doing so, however, was considered as too wasteful by the IPv6
        Operations Working Group.
        </t>
        <t>
        The shortest translation prefix that was reported to the IPv6
        Operations Working Group as being deployed in a live network was /64. The
        longest 16-bit-aligned prefix length that can accommodate multiple
        instances of /64 is /48. The prefix length of /48 was therefore
        chosen, as it satisfies both the criteria above, while at the same
        time avoids wasting too much of the IPv6 address space.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="prefix_value" title="Prefix Value">
        <t>
        It is desirable to minimise the amount of additional "pollution" in
        the unallocated IPv6 address space caused by the reservation made by
        this document. Ensuring the reserved prefix is adjacent to the
        64:ff9b::/96 WKP already reserved by <xref target="RFC6052"/>
        accomplishes this.
        </t>
        <t>
        Given the previous decision to use a prefix length of /48, this leaves
        two options: 64:ff9a:ffff::/48 and 64:ff9b:1::/48.
        </t>
        <t>
        64:ff9a:ffff::/48 has the benefit that it is completely adjacent to
        the <xref target="RFC6052"/> WKP. That is, 64:ff9a:ffff::/48 and
        64:ff9b::/96 combine to form an uninterrupted range of IPv6 addresses
        starting with 64:ff9a:ffff:: and ending with 64:ff9b::ffff:ffff.
        </t>
        <t>
        64:ff9b:1::/48 is, on the other hand, not completely adjacent to
        64:ff9b::/96. The range starting with 64:ff9b::1:0:0 and ending with
        64:ff9b:0:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff would remain unallocated.
        </t>
        <t>
        This particular drawback is, however, balanced by the fact that the
        smallest possible aggregate prefix that covers both the <xref
        target="RFC6052"/> WKP and 64:ff9a:ffff::/48 is much larger than the
        smallest possible aggregate prefix that covers both the <xref
        target="RFC6052"/> WKP and 64:ff9b:1::/48. These aggregate prefixes
        are 64:ff9a::/31 and 64:ff9b::/47, respectively. IPv6 address space is
        allocated using prefixes rather than address ranges, so it could be
        argued that 64:ff9b:1::/48 is the option that would cause special-use
        prefixes reserved for IPv4/IPv6 translation to "pollute" the minimum
        possible amount of unallocated IPv6 address space.
        </t>
        <t>
        Finally, 64:ff9b:1::/48 also has the advantage that its textual
        representation is shorter than 64:ff9a:ffff::/48. While this might
        seem insignificant, the preference human network operators have for
        addresses that are simple to type should not be underestimated.
        </t>
        <t>
        After weighing the above pros and cons, 64:ff9b:1::/48 was chosen.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="deployment" title="Deployment Considerations">
      <t>
      64:ff9b:1::/48 is intended as a technology-agnostic and generic
      reservation. A network operator may freely use it in combination with
      any kind of IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanism deployed within their
      network.
      </t>
      <t>
      By default, IPv6 nodes and applications must not treat IPv6 addresses
      within 64:ff9b:1::/48 differently from other globally scoped IPv6
      addresses. In particular, they must not make any assumptions regarding
      the syntax or properties of those addresses (e.g., the existence and
      location of embedded IPv4 addresses) or the type of associated
      translation mechanism (e.g., whether it is stateful or stateless).
      </t>
      <t>
      64:ff9b:1::/48 or any more-specific prefix may only be used in
      inter-domain routing if done in accordance with the rules described in
      Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC6052"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
      Note that 64:ff9b:1::/48 (or any more-specific prefix) is distinct from
      the WKP 64:ff9b::/96. Therefore, the restrictions on the use of the WKP
      described in Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC6052"/> do not apply to the
      use of 64:ff9b:1::/48.
      </t>
      <t>
      Operators tempted to use the covering aggregate prefix 64:ff9b::/47 to
      refer to all special-use prefixes currently reserved for IPv4/IPv6
      translation should be warned that this aggregate includes 
      a range of unallocated addresses (see <xref
      target="prefix_value"/>) that the
      IETF could potentially reserve in the future for entirely different
      purposes.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="checksum" title="Checksum Neutrality">
      <t>
      Use of 64:ff9b:1::/48 does not in itself guarantee checksum neutrality,
      as many of the IPv4/IPv6 translation algorithms it can be used with are
      fundamentally incompatible with checksum-neutral address translations.
      </t>
      <t>
      Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC6052"/> contains further discussion
      about IPv4/IPv6 translation and checksum neutrality.
      </t>
      <t>
      The Stateless IP/ICMP Translation algorithm <xref target="RFC7915"/> is
      one well-known algorithm that can operate in a checksum-neutral manner,
      when using the <xref target="RFC6052"/> algorithms for all of its
      address translations. However, in order to attain checksum neutrality,
      it is imperative that the translation prefix be chosen carefully.
      Specifically, in order for a 96-bit <xref target="RFC6052"/> prefix to
      be checksum neutral, all the six 16-bit words in the prefix must add up
      to a multiple of 0xffff.
      </t>
      <t>
      The following non-exhaustive list contains examples of translation
      prefixes that are checksum neutral when used with the <xref
      target="RFC7915"/> and <xref target="RFC6052"/> algorithms:
