      <t>This document defines requirements for standards specifications for
      Energy Management. The requirements defined in this document
      are concerned with monitoring functions as well as 
      control functions.  Monitoring functions include identifying
      energy-managed devices and their components, as well as monitoring
      their Power States, Power Inlets, Power Outlets, actual power,
      Power Attributes, received energy, provided 
      energy, and contained batteries.  
      Control functions include such functions as controlling power
      supply and Power State of energy-managed devices and
      their components.</t>

      <t>This document does not specify the features that must be 
      implemented by compliant implementations but rather lists features 
      that must be supported by standards for Energy Management.</t>

    <!-- Introduction ========================================== -->
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>With rising energy costs and an increasing awareness of 
      the ecological impact of running information technology 
      equipment, Energy Management (EMAN) functions and interfaces are 
      becoming an additional basic requirement for network 
      management systems and devices connected to a network.</t>

      <t>This document defines requirements for standards specifications for
      Energy Management, both monitoring functions and control functions.
      Energy Management functions focus mainly on devices and their components
      that receive and provide electrical energy. Devices such as hosts,
      routers, and middleboxes may have an IP address or may be
      connected indirectly to the Internet via a proxy with an IP address
      providing a management interface for the device, for example,
      devices in a building infrastructure using non-IP protocols and a
      gateway to the Internet.</t>

      <t>These requirements are concerned with the standards specification
      process and not the implementation of specified standards. All
      requirements in this document must be reflected by standards
      specifications to be developed. However, which of the features
      specified by these standards will be mandatory, recommended, or
      optional for compliant implementations is to be defined by
      Standards Track document(s) and not in this document.</t>

      <t><xref target="goals"/> elaborates on a set of general needs 
      for Energy Management. Requirements
      for an Energy Management standard are specified in
      Sections <xref format="counter" target="identity"/> through
      <xref format="counter" target="controlother"/>.</t>
      
      <t>Sections <xref format="counter" target="identity"/> through
      <xref format="counter" target="control"/> contain  
      conventional requirements specifying information on entities   
      and control functions.</t>
      
      <t>Sections <xref format="counter" target="reportonother"/> 
      and <xref format="counter" target="controlother"/> contain 
      requirements specific to Energy Management.  Due to the nature
      of power supply, some monitoring and control functions are not 
      conducted by interacting with the entity of interest but rather
      with other entities, for example, entities upstream in a power distribution
      tree.</t>

      <section anchor="conventional" 
        title="Conventional Requirements for Energy Management">
        <t>The specification of requirements for an Energy Management
        standard starts with <xref target="identity"/>,
        which addresses the identification of entities and the 
        granularity of reporting of energy-related information. 
        A standard must support the unique identification of entities,
        reporting per entire device, and reporting 
        energy-related information on individual components of a 
        device or attached devices.</t>

        <t><xref target="properties"/> specifies requirements 
        related to the monitoring of entities. This includes 
        general (type, context) information and specific information
        on Power States, Power Inlets, Power Outlets, power, energy, 
        and batteries. The control of Power State and power supply
        by entities is covered by requirements specified in 
        <xref target="control"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Specific Requirements for Energy Management">

        <t>While the conventional requirements summarized above seem
        to be all that would be needed for Energy Management, there 
        are significant differences between Energy Management and 
        most well-known network management functions.
        The most significant difference 
        is the need for some devices to report on other
        entities. There are three major reasons for this.
                
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>For monitoring a particular entity, it is not 
          always sufficient to communicate only with that entity.
          When the entity has no instrumentation for determining power,
          it might still be possible to obtain power values for the
          entity via communication with other entities in its
          power distribution tree.  A simple example of this would be
          the retrieval of power values from a power meter at the
          power line into the entity. A Power Distribution Unit (PDU) and
          a Power over Ethernet (PoE) switch are common examples.
          Both supply power to other entities at sockets or ports,
          respectively, and are often instrumented to measure power
          per socket or port.
          </t>
      
          <t>Similar considerations apply to controlling the power 
          supply of an entity that often needs direct or 
          indirect communications with 
          another entity upstream in the power distribution tree. 
          Again, a PDU and a PoE switch are common examples, if they 
          have the capability to switch power on or off at their 
          sockets or ports, respectively.</t>
      
          <t>Energy Management often extends beyond entities with IP network
          interfaces to non-IP building systems accessed via a gateway 
          (sometimes called an Energy Management System or controller).
          Requirements in this document do not cover the details of these
          networks and energy devices but specify means for opening 
          IP network management towards them.</t>
        </list></t>
        
        <t>These specific issues of Energy Management, as well as other
        issues, are covered by requirements specified in 
        Sections <xref format="counter" target="reportonother"/> and
        <xref format="counter" target="controlother"/>.</t>
        
        <t>The requirements in these sections need a new Energy Management
        framework that deals with the specific nature of Energy Management. 
        The actual standards documents, such as MIB module 
        specifications, address conformance by specifying which 
        features must, should, or may be implemented by compliant 
        implementations.

    <!-- Objectives ============================================ -->

    <section anchor="goals" 
      title="General Considerations Related to Energy Management">
      <t>The basic objective of Energy Management is to operate
      sets of devices using minimal energy, while maintaining 
      a certain level of service.  
      <xref target="EMAN-STATEMENT"></xref>
      presents the applicability of the EMAN framework to a variety of 
      scenarios and also lists use cases and target devices.</t>  

      <section anchor="powerstates" title="Power States">
        <t>
        Entities can be set to an operational state that 
        results in the lowest power level that still meets the 
        service-level performance objectives.  In principle, there 
        are three basic types of Power States for an entity 
        or for a whole system:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>full Power State</t>

          <t>sleep state (not functional but immediately available)</t>

          <t>off state (may require significant time to become operational)</t>
        </list>
        In specific devices, the number of Power States and their 
        properties vary considerably. Simple entities may only
        have the extreme states: full Power State and off state. 
        Many devices have three basic Power States: on, off, and 
        sleep.  However, more finely grained Power States can be 
        implemented. Examples are various operational low Power States
        in which a device requires less energy than in the
        full power "on" state, but -- compared to the sleep state -- 
        is still operational with reduced performance or 
        functionality.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="tradeoffs" 
        title="Saving Energy versus Maintaining Service Level">
        <t>One of the objectives of Energy Management is to reduce 
        energy consumption. While this objective is clear, attaining
        that goal is often difficult.   
        In many cases, there is no way to reduce power without the 
        consequence of a potential service (performance or capacity) 
        degradation.  In this case, a trade-off needs to be made 
        between service-level objectives and energy minimization.  
        In other cases, a reduction of power can 
        easily be achieved while still maintaining 
        sufficient service-level performance, for example, by 
        switching entities to lower Power States when higher
        performance is not needed.</t> 
      </section>

      <section anchor="localglobal" 
               title="Local versus Network-Wide Energy Management">
        <t>Many energy-saving functions are executed locally by 
        an entity; it 
        monitors its usage and dynamically adapts its power 
        according to the required performance. It may, 
        for example, switch to a sleep state when it is not in use,
        or outside of scheduled business hours. 
        An Energy Management System may observe an entity's Power State
        and configure its power-saving policies.</t>

        <t>Energy savings can also be achieved with policies 
        implemented by a network management system that controls 
        Power States of managed entities.  Information about the 
        power received and provided by entities in different
        Power States may be required in order to set such policies.
        Often, this information is best acquired through monitoring.</t>
        
        <t>Network-wide and local Energy Management methods both
        have advantages and disadvantages, and it is often desirable 
        to combine them. Central management is often favorable for 
        setting Power States of a large number of entities at the 
        same time, for example, at the beginning and end of business
        hours in a building. Local management is often preferable 
        for power-saving measures based on local observations, such 
        as the high or low functional load of an entity.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="monitoring" 
               title="Energy Monitoring versus Energy Saving">
        <t>Monitoring energy, power, 
        and Power States alone does not reduce the energy
        needed to run an entity. In fact, it may even
        increase it slightly due to monitoring instrumentation that 
        needs energy. Reporting measured quantities
        over the network may also increase energy use, though the 
        acquired information may be an essential 
        input to control loops that save energy.</t>

        <t>Monitoring energy and Power States  
        can also be required for other purposes,
        including:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>investigating energy-saving potential</t>
          <t>evaluating the effectiveness of energy-saving policies 
          and measures</t>
          <t>deriving, implementing, and testing power management
          strategies</t>
          <t>accounting for the total power received and provided by
          an entity, a network, or a service</t>
          <t>predicting an entity's reliability based on 
          power usage</t>
          <t>choosing the time of the next maintenance cycle for an 
          entity</t>
        </list></t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="requirements" 
               title="Overview of Energy Management Requirements">
        <t>The following basic management functions are required: 
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>monitoring Power States</t>
          <t>monitoring power (energy conversion rate)</t>
          <t>monitoring (accumulated) received and provided 
          energy</t>
          <t>monitoring Power Attributes</t>
          <t>setting Power States</t>
        </list></t>
      
        <t>Power control is complementary to other energy-saving
        measures, such as low-power electronics, energy-saving 
        protocols, energy-efficient device design (for example, 
        low-power modes for components), and energy-efficient 
        network architectures.  Measurement of received and provided
        energy can provide useful data for developing these 
        technologies.</t>

    <!-- ===== Requirements related to Identity of entities =========  -->

    <section anchor="identity" 
             title="Identification of Entities">
      <t>Entities must be capable of being uniquely identified within
      the context of the management system.  This 
      includes entities that are components of managed devices 
      as well as entire devices.</t> 
      
      <t>Entities that report on or control other entities 
      must identify the entities they report on or control: 
      see <xref target="reportonother"/> or 
      <xref target="controlother"/>, respectively, for the 
      detailed requirements.</t>      
      
      <t> An entity may be an entire device or a 
      component of it. Examples of components of interest are 
      a hard drive, a battery, or a line card. 
      The ability to control individual components to save energy may be
      required. For example, server blades 
      can be switched off when the overall load is low, or line cards
      at switches may be powered down at night.</t>

      <section anchor="inlet" title="Power Interfaces">
        <t>A Power Interface is an interface at which a device is 
        connected to a power transmission medium, at which it can in
        turn receive power, provide power, or both.</t>

        <t>A Power Interface is either an inlet or an outlet.  
        Some Power Interfaces change over time from being an inlet 
        to being an outlet and vice versa.  However, most Power 
        Interfaces never change.</t>
        
        <t>Devices have Power Inlets at which they are 
        supplied with electric power. Most devices have a 
        single Power Inlet, while some have multiple inlets. 
        Different Power Inlets on a device are often connected to 
        separate power distribution trees. For Energy Monitoring, 
        it is useful to retrieve information on the number of inlets 
        of a device, the availability of power at inlets, 
        and which inlets are actually in use.</t>
        
        <t>Devices can have one or more Power Outlets for 
        supplying other devices with electric power. </t>

        <t>For identifying and potentially controlling the source of 
        power received at an inlet, identifying the Power Outlet of
        another device at which the received power is provided may be
        required. Analogously, for each outlet, it 
        is of interest to identify the Power Inlets that receive the
        power provided at a certain outlet.  Such information is 
        also required for constructing the wiring topology of 
        electrical power distribution to devices.</t>
        
        <t>Static properties of each Power Interface are required 
        information for Energy Management. Static properties 
        include the kind of electric current (AC or DC), the nominal 
        voltage, the nominal AC frequency, and the number of AC 
        phases.  Note that the nominal voltage is often not a single 
        value but a voltage range, such as, for example, (100V-120V), 
        (100V-240V), (100V-120V,220V-240V).</t>

        <t>Depending on how power and energy values are 
        obtained, the confidence in a reported value and its

      <section anchor="battery" title="Battery State">
        <t>Batteries are special entities that supply power.  
        The status of these batteries is typically controlled by 
        automatic functions that act locally on the entity, and 
        manually by users of the entity. There is a need to monitor 
        the battery status of these entities by network management 
        systems.</t>
        
        <t>Devices containing batteries can be modeled in two ways. 
        The entire device can be modeled as a single entity 
        on which energy-related information is reported, or the

      <section anchor="timeseries" 
               title="Time Series of Measured Values">
        <t>For some network management tasks, obtaining time series
        of measured values from entities, such as power, energy,
        battery charge, etc., is required.</t>
        
        <t>In general, time series measurements could be obtained in 
        many different ways. Means should be provided to either 
        push such values from the location where they are available 
        to the management system or to have them stored locally for 
        a sufficiently long period of time such that a management 
        system can retrieve the full time series.</t> 
        
        <t>The following issues are to be considered when designing
        time series measurement and reporting functions:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Which quantities should be reported?</t>
          <t>Which time interval type should be used (total, delta, 
          sliding window)?</t>
          <t>Which measurement method should be used (sampled, 
          continuous)?</t>
          <t>Which reporting model should be used (push or pull)?
          </t>
        </list>
        </t>
        
        <t>The most discussed and probably most needed quantity 
        is energy. But a need for others, such as power and 
        battery charge, can be identified as well.</t>

        <t>There are three time interval types under discussion for 
        accumulated quantities such as energy.  They can be reported 
        as total values, accumulated between the last restart of the 
        measurement and a certain timestamp. Alternatively, energy 
        can be reported as delta values between two consecutive 
        timestamps.  Another alternative is reporting values for 
        sliding windows as specified in <xref 
        target="IEC.61850-7-4"/>.</t>

        <t>For non-accumulative quantities, such as power, different 
        measurement methods are considered. Such quantities can be 
        reported using values sampled at certain timestamps or,
        alternatively, by mean values for these quantities averaged 
        between two (consecutive) timestamps or over a sliding 
        window.</t>

        <t>Finally, time series can be reported using different 
        reporting models, particularly push-based or pull-based.  
        Push-based reporting can, for example, be realized by 
        reporting power or energy values using the
        IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) protocol 
        <xref target="RFC7011"/> <xref target="RFC7012"/>.
        The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) 
        <xref target="RFC3411"/> is an example of a protocol that 
        can be used for realizing pull-based reporting of time 
        series.</t> 
        
        <t>For reporting time series of measured values, the 
        following requirements have been identified.  Further 
        decisions concerning issues discussed above need to be 
        made when developing concrete Energy Management 
        standards.</t>

       <section toc="exclude" title="Time Series of Energy Values">
          <t>The standard must provide means for reporting time series
           of energy values. If the comparison of time series between
           multiple entities is required, then time synchronization 
           between those entities must be provided (for example, with 
           the Network Time Protocol <xref target="RFC5905"/>).</t>

    <!-- ===== Requirements related to Entity Control ================ -->

    <section anchor="control" title="Control of Entities">
      <t>Many entities control their Power State locally.
      Other entities need interfaces for an Energy Management System
      to control their Power State.</t>

      <t>A power supply is typically not self-managed by devices,
      and control of a power supply is typically not conducted as 
      an interaction between an Energy Management System and 
      the device itself. It is rather an interaction between
      the management system and a device providing power at its 
      Power Outlets.  Similar to Power State control, power supply 
      control may be policy driven. Note that shutting down the 
      power supply abruptly may have severe consequences for the 
      device.</t>

      single Power Outlet or where a power meter measures the 
      accumulated power of several entities at a single 
      power line.  Consequently, it should be possible to report 
      that a monitored value does not relate to just a single

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      
      <t>Controlling Power State and power supply of  
      entities are considered highly sensitive actions, since they can 
      significantly affect the operation of directly and indirectly 
      connected devices.  Therefore, all control actions addressed in 
      Sections <xref format="counter" target="control"/> and  <xref 
      format="counter" target="controlother"/> must be sufficiently 
      protected through authentication, authorization, and integrity
      protection mechanisms.</t>

      <t>Entities that are not sufficiently secure to operate directly 
      on the public Internet do exist and can be a significant cause 
      of risk, for example, if the remote control functions described 
      in Sections <xref format="counter" target="control"/> and  <xref 
      format="counter" target="controlother"/> can be exercised on 
      those devices from anywhere on the Internet.  The standard needs 
      to provide means for dealing with such cases.  One solution is 
      providing means that allow the isolation of such devices, e.g.,
      behind a sufficiently secured gateway. Another solution is
      to allow compliant implementations to disable sensitive functions,
      or to not implement such functions at all.</t>

      <t>The monitoring of energy-related quantities of an entity as
      addressed in Sections <xref format="counter" target="properties"/>
      through <xref format="counter" target="controlother"/> can be used
      to derive more information
      than just the received and provided energy; therefore, monitored data 
      requires protection. This protection includes authentication 
      and authorization of entities requesting access to monitored 
      data as well as confidentiality protection during transmission 
      of monitored data.  Privacy of stored data in an entity
      must be taken into account. Monitored data may be used as
      input to control, accounting, and other actions, so integrity of
      transmitted information and authentication of the origin may be
      needed.</t>

      <section toc="exclude" title="Secure Energy Management">
        <t>The standard must provide privacy, integrity, and 
        authentication mechanisms for all actions addressed in 
        Sections <xref format="counter" target="properties"/>

        The security mechanisms must meet the security requirements
