   This document defines a new OSPF Router Information (RI) TLV that
   allows OSPF routers to flood their hostname-to-Router-ID mapping
   information across an OSPF network to provide a simple and dynamic
   mechanism for routers running OSPF to learn about symbolic hostnames,
   just like for routers running IS-IS. This mechanism is applicable to both
  OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

        <section anchor="Intro" title="Introduction">
            <t>OSPF uses a 32-bit Router ID to uniquely represent and
            identify a node in the network. For 
                management and operational reasons, network operators need to check the 
                status of OSPF adjacencies, entries in the routing table, and the 
                content of the OSPF link state database. When 
                looking at diagnostic information, numerical representations 
                of Router IDs (e.g., dotted-decimal or hexadecimal representations)
                are less clear to humans than symbolic names.</t>
                <t>
                One way to overcome this problem is to define a hostname-to-Router-ID
                mapping table on a router. This mapping can be used bidirectionally (e.g.,
                to find symbolic names for Router IDs and to find Router IDs for
                symbolic names) or unidirectionally (e.g., to find
                symbolic hostnames for Router IDs).
                Thus, every router has to maintain a table with mappings between
                router names and Router IDs.
                </t><t>
                 These tables need to contain all names
                and Router IDs of all routers in the network.  If these mapping tables are
                built by static definitions, it can currently become a manual and tedious
                process in operational networks;
                modifying these static mapping entries when additions,
                 deletions, or changes occur becomes a non-scalable
                 process very prone to error.</t>

                <t>
                This document analyzes possible solutions to this problem
                (see <xref target="Solutions"/>) and provides a way to populate  tables
                by defining a new OSPF Router Information TLV for OSPF, the Dynamic Hostname TLV
                (see <xref target="Implementation"/>). This mechanism is applicable to both OSPFv2 
                and OSPFv3.

            <t>
                There are various approaches to providing a
                name-to-Router-ID mapping service.
            </t>
            <t>One way to build this table of mappings is by static definitions.
            The problem with static definitions is that the network administrator needs
            to keep updating the mapping entries manually
            as the network changes; this approach does not scale as the network
            grows, since there needs to be an entry in the mapping table for each and every 
            router in the network, on every router in the network. Thus, 
            this approach greatly suffers from maintainability and scalability considerations.</t>
            <t>
            Another approach is having a centralized location where
            the name-to-Router-ID mapping can be kept. The DNS could
            be used for this. A disadvantage
            with this centralized solution is that it is a single point of failure;
            and although enhanced availability of the central mapping service can 
            be designed, it may not be able to resolve the hostname in
            the event of reachability or network problems, which can be particularly
problematic in times of problem resolution. Also,
            the response time can be an issue with the centralized solution, which
            can be equally problematic.
            If the DNS is used as the centralized mapping table, a
            network operator may desire 
            a different name mapping than the existing mapping in the
            DNS, or new routers may not yet be in the DNS.
            </t>
            <t>
Additionally, for OSPFv3 in native IPv6 deployments,
the 32-bit Router ID value will not map to IPv4-addressed
entities in the network, nor will it be DNS resolvable
(see <xref target="IPv6"/>).

            </t>
            <t>
            The third solution that we have defined in this
            document is to make use of the 
            protocol itself to carry the name-to-Router-ID mapping in
            a TLV. Routers that understand this 
            TLV can use it to create the symbolic name-to-Router-ID
            mapping, and routers that don't understand it can simply
            ignore it. This specification provides these semantics 
            and mapping mechanisms for OSPFv2 and OSPFv3, leveraging the 
            OSPF Router Information (RI) Link State Advertisement
            (LSA) (<xref target="RFC4970"/>).</t>

Routers that do not recognize the Dynamic Hostname TLV Type ignore
the TLV (see <xref target="RFC4970"/>).
                        </t>

                <t>The Value field identifies the symbolic hostname of
                the router originating the LSA. This symbolic name can
                be the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for the
                Router ID, it can be a subset of the FQDN, or it can
                be any string that operators want to use for the router.
The use of FQDN or a subset of it is strongly recommended
since it can be beneficial to correlate the OSPF dynamic hostname and  
the DNS hostname. The format of the DNS hostname is described in  
<xref target="RFC1035"/> and <xref target="RFC2181"/>.
If there is no DNS hostname for the Router ID, if the Router ID does not map to an
   IPv4-addressed entity (e.g., see <xref target="IPv6"/>), or if an  
alternate OSPF dynamic hostname naming convention is desired,
   any string with significance in the OSPF routing domain can be used.
The string is not null-terminated. The Router ID of this 
                    router is derived from the LSA header, in the Advertising Router field
                    of the Router Information (RI) Opaque LSA.</t>
<t>
   The Value field is encoded in 7-bit ASCII.  If a user-interface for
   configuring or displaying this field permits Unicode characters, that
   user-interface is responsible for applying the ToASCII and/or
   ToUnicode algorithm as described in <xref target="RFC3490"/> to achieve the correct
   format for transmission or display.
</t>
                <t>The Dynamic Hostname TLV is applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.</t>

            <section anchor="Scope" title="Flooding Scope">
<t>

The Dynamic Hostname TLV MAY be advertised within an area-local or 
autonomous system (AS)-scope Router Information (RI) LSA.
   But the Dynamic Hostname TLV SHOULD NOT
   be advertised into an area in more than one RI LSA, irrespective of the
   scope of the LSA.

</t><t>

   In other words, if a router originates a Dynamic Hostname TLV with
   an IGP domain (AS) flooding scope, it SHOULD NOT send area-scoped
   Dynamic Hostname TLVs except into any attached Not-So-Stubby Area
   (NSSA) area(s).


Similarly, if a router originates an area-scoped 
   Dynamic Hostname TLV (other than NSSA area scoped), it SHOULD NOT
   send an AS-scoped Dynamic Hostname TLV. When the Dynamic Hostname TLV is
   advertised in more than one LSA (e.g., multiple area-scoped LSAs, or
   AS-scoped LSAs plus NSSA area-scope LSA(s)),
   the hostname SHOULD be the same.
</t><t>
  
   If a router is advertising any AS-scope LSA (other than Dynamic Hostname 
   TLV RI LSA),
   such router SHOULD advertise Dynamic Hostname 
   TLV RI LSA in AS scope. Otherwise, it
   SHOULD advertise Dynamic Hostname 
   TLV RI LSA in area scope. For example, an
   AS boundary router (ASBR) SHOULD send an AS-scope Dynamic Hostname TLV, 
   whereas area boundary router (ABRs) and internal routers SHOULD send an 
   area-scope Dynamic Hostname TLV.  

</t><t>

 The flooding scope is controlled
by the Opaque LSA type in OSPFv2 and by
the S1 and S2 bits in OSPFv3.
For area scope, the Dynamic Hostname TLV
MUST be carried within an OSPFv2 Type 10 RI LSA or an OSPFv3 RI LSA
with the S1 bit set and the S2 bit clear. If the flooding scope is the entire
routing domain (AS scope), the Dynamic Hostname TLV MUST be carried within 
an OSPFv2 Type 11 RI LSA or OSPFv3 RI LSA with the S1 bit clear and the 
S2 bit set.
</t>
                </section>
            <section anchor="MultiInstance" title="Multiple OSPF Instances">
<t>

When an OSPF Router Information (RI) LSA, including
the Dynamic Hostname TLV, is advertised in multiple
OSPF instances, the hostname SHOULD either be preserved or
include a common base element. It may be useful
for debugging or other purposes to assign separate
instances different hostnames with a consistent set of
suffixes or prefixes that can be associated with a specific
instance -- in particular, when an instance is used for a
discrete address family or non-routing information.

        <section anchor="IPv6" title="IPv6 Considerations">
            <t>
Both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 employ Router IDs with a common
size of 32 bits.  In IPv4, the Router ID values were typically
derived automatically from an IPv4 address either configured on a
loopback or physical interface defined on the local system or
explicitly defined within the OSPF process configuration.
With broader deployment of IPv6, it's quite likely that OSPF
networks will exist that have no native IPv4-addressed
interfaces.  As a result, a 32-bit OSPF Router ID will 
need to be either explicitly specified or derived in some automatic
manner that avoids collisions with other OSPF routers
within the local routing domain.
            </t>
            <t>

Because this 32-bit value will not map to IPv4-addressed
entities in the network, nor will it be DNS resolvable, it is
considered extremely desirable from an operational perspective
that some mechanism exist to map OSPF Router IDs to more
easily interpreted values -- ideally, human-readable strings.  This
specification enables a mapping functionality that eases
operational burdens that may otherwise be introduced with
native deployment of IPv6.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
   Since the hostname-to-Router-ID mapping relies on information provided by
   the routers themselves, a misconfigured or compromised router can
   inject false mapping information, including a duplicate hostname for
   different Router IDs.  Thus, this information needs to be
   treated with suspicion when, for example, doing diagnostics about a
   suspected security incident.
            </t>
            <t>
There is potential confusion from name collisions if two routers use
and advertise the same dynamic hostname. Name conflicts are not
crucial, and therefore there is no generic conflict detection or
resolution mechanism in the protocol.
However, a router that detects that a received hostname is the same as
the local one can issue a notification or a management alert.
            </t>
            <t>
The use of the FQDN as OSPF dynamic hostname
potentially exposes geographic or other commercial
information that can be deduced
from the hostname when sent in the clear.
OSPFv3 supports confidentiality via transport mode IPsec (see
<xref target="RFC4552"/>). OSPFv2 could be operated over IPsec tunnels
if confidentiality is required.
            </t>
            <t>   This document raises no other new security issues for OSPF.
Security
   considerations for the base OSPF protocol are covered in <xref target="RFC2328"/> and
   <xref target="RFC5340"/>. The use of authentication for the OSPF routing protocols is encouraged.
