  <section title="Introduction">

     <t>A textual representation for Autonomous System (AS) numbers is
     defined as the decimal value of the AS number. This textual
     representation is to be used by all documents, systems, and user
     interfaces referring to AS numbers.</t>

     <t>This document notes a number of potential representation
     formats and proposes the adoption of a decimal value notation for
     AS numbers, or "asplain" according to the representation taxonomy
     described here.</t>

  </section>


  <section title="Taxonomy of Representation Formats">
  <t>A taxonomy of representation for AS numbers is as follows:</t>

  <t><list style="hanging">

     <t hangText="asplain"><vspace blankLines="0" /> refers to a
     syntax scheme of representing all AS numbers using decimal
     integer notation. Using asplain notation, an AS number of value
     65526 would be represented as the string "65526" and an AS number
     of value 65546 would be represented as the string "65546".<vspace
     blankLines="1" /></t>

     <t hangText="asdot+"><vspace blankLines="0" /> refers to a syntax
     scheme of representing all AS numbers using a notation of two
     integer values joined by a period character: &lt;high order
     16-bit value in decimal&gt;.&lt;low order 16-bit value in
     decimal&gt;.  Using asdot+ notation, an AS number of value 65526
     would be represented as the string "0.65526" and an AS number of
     value 65546 would be represented as the string "1.10".<vspace
     blankLines="1" /></t>

     <t hangText="asdot"><vspace blankLines="0" /> refers to a syntax
     scheme of representing AS number values less than 65536 using
     asplain notation and representing AS number values equal to or
     greater than 65536 using asdot+ notation.  Using asdot notation,
     an AS number of value 65526 would be represented as the string
     "65526" and an AS number of value 65546 would be represented as
     the string "1.10".  <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
     </list></t>
  </section>
  <section title="Representation of AS Number Values">

     <t>To avoid confusion, a single textual notation is useful for
     documentation, configuration systems, reports, and external tools
     and information repositories. The decimal value representation,
     or "asplain" is proposed as the textual notation to use for AS
     numbers.</t>

     <t>The "asplain" representation represents the number as its
     decimal value, without any field delimiter, corresponding to the
     lack of any internal structure required by the use of AS numbers
     in the inter-domain routing context.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="IANA Considerations">

    <t>IANA Registries should use decimal representation ("asplain")
    for AS numbers.</t>

  </section>
  <section title="Security Considerations">

    <t>This document does not refer to matters associated with
    security of routing systems.</t>

  </section>
  <section title="Acknowledgments">

     <t>The terminology of "asplain", "asdot", and "asdot+" was
     originally devised and described by Juergen Kammer in January
     2007 <xref target='KAMMER2007'/>.</t>
