      <t>
	  The aim of this document is to establish a new IANA registry for IMAP keywords
	  and to define a procedure for keyword registration, in order
	  to improve interoperability between different IMAP clients.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	  IMAP keywords <xref target="RFC3501"/> are boolean named flags that can be used
	  by clients to annotate messages in an IMAP mailbox.
	  Although IMAP keywords are an optional feature of IMAP, the majority
	  of IMAP servers can store arbitrary keywords. Many mainstream IMAP clients
	  use a limited set of specific keywords, and some can manage (create, edit, display)
	  arbitrary IMAP keywords.
	  </t>

      <t>
	  Over the years, some IMAP keywords have become de-facto standards, with some specific semantics
	  associated with them. In some cases, different client implementors decided to
	  define and use keywords with different names, but the same semantics. Some server
	  implementors decided to map such keywords automatically in order to improve cross-client
	  interoperability.
	  </t>

      <t>In other cases, the same keywords have been used with different semantics,
	  thus causing interoperability problems.</t>
		
      <t>This document attempts to prevent further incompatible uses of IMAP keywords by
	 establishing an "IMAP Keywords" registry and allocating a special prefix
	 for standardized keywords.
	 </t>

        </t>
	  </list>
		
		</t>
	
		<t>
		Registration of an IMAP keyword requires
		Expert Review <xref target="RFC5226"/>.
		Registration of any IMAP keyword is initiated by
		posting a registration request to the Message Organization WG
		mailing list &lt;morg@ietf.org&gt; (or its replacement as chosen by
		the responsible Application Area Director) and CCing IANA (&lt;iana@iana.org&gt;).
		After allowing for at least two weeks for community input on the designated mailing
		list, the expert will determine the appropriateness of the
		registration request and either approve or disapprove the request
		with notice to the requestor, the mailing list, and IANA.
		Any refusal must come with a clear explanation.
		</t>
		
		<t>
		The IESG appoints one or more Expert Reviewers for the IMAP keyword registry
		established by this document.
		</t>
		
		<t>
		The Expert Reviewer should strive for timely reviews. The Expert Reviewer
		should take no longer than six weeks to make and announce the decision,
		or notify the mailing list that more time is required.
		</t>
		
		<t>
		Decisions (or lack of) made by an Expert Reviewer can be first appealed
		to Application Area Directors and, if the appellant is not satisfied with
		the response, to the full IESG.
		</t>
	
		<t>
		There are two types of IMAP keywords in the "IMAP Keywords" registry:
		intended for "common use" and vendor-/organization-specific use (also known as
		"limited use").
		An IMAP keyword is said to be for "common use" if it is reasonably expected
		to be implemented in at least two independent client implementations.
		The two types of IMAP keywords have different levels of requirements
		for registration (see below).
		</t>
	
		<section title="Review Guidelines for the Designated Expert Reviewer">
		    
		<t>
		Expert Reviewers should focus on the following requirements.
		</t>
		    
		<t>
		Registration of a vendor-/organization-specific ("limited use") IMAP keyword
		is easier. The Expert Reviewer only needs to check that the requested
		name doesn't conflict with an already registered name, and that the name
		is not too generic, misleading, etc. The Expert Reviewer
		MAY request the IMAP keyword name change before approving the registration.
		The Expert Reviewer SHOULD refuse a registration if there is an already
		registered IMAP keyword that serves the same purpose, but has a different name.
		</t>

		<t>When registering an IMAP keyword for "common use", the Expert Reviewer
		performs the checks described for vendor-/organization-specific IMAP keywords, plus additional
		checks as detailed below.</t>
		    
		<t>
		Keywords intended for "common use" SHOULD start with the "$" prefix.
		(Note that this is a SHOULD because some of the commonly used IMAP keywords
		in widespread use don't follow this convention.)
		</t>

		<t>
		IMAP keywords intended for "common use" 
		SHOULD be standardized in IETF Review <xref target="RFC5226"/> documents.
		(Note that IETF Review documents still require Expert Review.)
		</t>

		<t>
		Values in the "IMAP Keywords" IANA registry intended for "common use"
		must be clearly documented and likely to ensure interoperability.
		They must be useful, not harmful to the Internet.
		In cases when an IMAP keyword being registered is already deployed,
		Expert Reviewers should favor registering it over requiring perfect
		documentation and/or requesting a change to the name of the IMAP keyword.
		</t>
		    
		<t>The Expert Reviewer MAY automatically "upgrade" registration requests
		for a "limited use" IMAP keyword to "common use" level. The Expert Reviewer
		MAY also request that a registration targeted for "common use" be registered
		as "limited use" instead.
		</t>

		</section>

		<section title="Comments on IMAP Keywords' Registrations">
			<t>
			Comments on registered IMAP keywords should be sent to both the
			"owner" of the mechanism and to the mailing list designated to IMAP keyword review
			(see <xref target="iana"/>). This improves the chances of getting a timely response.
			</t>

			<t>
			Submitters of comments may, after a reasonable attempt to contact the
			owner and after soliciting comments on the IMAP mailing list,
			request the designated Expert Reviewer to attach their comment to the IMAP keyword
			registration itself. The procedure is similar to requesting an Expert Review
			for the affected keyword.
			</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Change Control">
			<t>
			Once an IMAP keyword registration has been published by IANA, the
			owner may request a change to its definition.  The change request (including a change
			to the "intended usage" field)
			follows the same procedure as the initial registration request, with the exception
			of changes to the "Person &amp; email address to contact for further information"
			and "Owner/Change controller" fields. The latter can be changed by the owner
			by informing IANA; this can be done without discussion or review.
			</t>

			<t>
			The IESG may reassign responsibility for an IMAP keyword.  The most
			common case of this will be to enable clarifications to be made to keywords
			where the owner of the registration has died, moved out of contact, or
			is otherwise unable to make changes that are important to the
			community.
			</t>

			<t>
			IMAP keyword registrations MUST NOT be deleted; keywords that are
			no longer believed appropriate for use can be declared DEPRECATED by a
			change to their "intended usage" field.
			</t>

			<t>
			The IESG is considered the owner of all "common use" IMAP keywords
			that are published in an IETF Review document.
			</t>

<abstract>
<t>
   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
   capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
   interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
   should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

<list>
<t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119.

</t></list></t>
<t>
   Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement
   level of the document in which they are used.
