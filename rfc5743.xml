      <t>This memo defines the publication stream for RFCs from the Internet
      Research Task Force. Most documents undergoing this process will come
      from IRTF Research Groups, and it is expected that they will be published
      as Informational or Experimental RFCs by the RFC Editor.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>From time to time the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) <xref
      target="RFC2014"></xref> will wish to publish a document in the Internet
      RFC series. This memo defines the steps required to publish a document
      in the IRTF RFC stream. Document streams are described in Section 5 of
      <xref target="RFC4844"></xref>. Most documents undergoing this process
      will come from IRTF Research Groups and it is expected that they will be
      published as Informational or Experimental RFCs by the RFC Editor.</t>

      <t>The IRTF RFC stream provides an avenue for research groups to publish
      their findings with an IRTF label. Pre-publication editorial review by
      the Internet Research Steering Group (IRSG) increases the readibility of
      documents and ensures proper caveats (described in <xref
      target="rg-prep"></xref>) are applied.</t>

      <t>The IRTF RFC approval process may be summarized as:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>The Research Group (RG) performs a thorough technical and
          editorial review of the document and agrees it should be
          published.</t>

          <t>The Internet Research Steering Group (IRSG) reviews the document
          and approves it for publication.</t>

          <t>The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) reviews the
          document to assure that there are no conflicts with current or
          expected standardization activities.</t>

          <t>The document is submitted to the RFC Editor for publication.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This document has been updated based on over a year of experience and
      processing of roughly a dozen documents. The IRTF concludes that there
      has been sufficient experience to justify that the benefits and process are
      sound.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Approval Process">
      <t>The following sections describe the steps for IRTF-stream document
      review and publication process. There are fundamentally two steps: IRSG
      review and IESG review. The document shepherd is responsible for making
      sure reviews are responded to and documented and that the process moves
      along.</t>

      <section anchor="rg-prep" title="Research Group Preparation">
        <t>If an IRTF Research Group desires to publish a document as an IRTF
        RFC, the process in this document must be followed. First, the RG must
        review the document for editorial and technical quality.</t>

        <t>The following guidelines should be adhered to:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>There must be a statement in the abstract identifying it as the
            product of the RG.</t>

            <t>There must be a paragraph near the beginning (for example, in
            the introduction) describing the level of support for publication.
            Example text might read: "this document represents the consensus
            of the FOOBAR RG" or "the views in this document were considered
            controversial by the FOOBAR RG but the RG reached a consensus that
            the document should still be published".</t>

            <t>The breadth of review the document has received must also be
            noted. For example, was this document read by all the active
            research group members, only three people, or folks who are not
            "in" the RG but are expert in the area?</t>

            <t>It must also be very clear throughout the document that it is
            not an IETF product and is not a standard.</t>

            <t>If an experimental protocol is described, appropriate usage
            caveats must be present.</t>

            <t>If the protocol has been considered in an IETF working group in
            the past, this must be noted in the introduction as well.</t>

            <t>There should be citations and references to relevant research
            publications.</t>
          </list>The Research Group identifies a document shepherd whose
        responsibilty is to track and facilitate document progression through
        RFC publication. The shepherd should be copied on all correspondence
        relating to the document.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="irsg-review" title="IRSG Review and Approval">
        <t>The IRSG functions similar to an editorial review board. It is the
        IRSG's responsibility to ensure high technical and editorial quality.
        The IRSG will review and approve all documents intended for
        RFC publication from the IRTF stream.</t>

        <t>The purpose of the IRSG review is to ensure consistent technical
        clarity and editorial quality for IRTF publications. The IRSG review is
        not a deep technical review (this should take place within the RG).
        At least one IRSG member who is not a chair of that research group
        must review the document and the RG's editorial process.</t>

        <t>IRSG reviewers should look for clear, cogent, and consistent
        writing. An important aspect of the review is to gain a critical
        reading from reviewers who are not subject matter experts and, in the
        process, assure the document will be accessible to those beyond the
        authoring research group. Also, reviewers should assess whether
        sufficient editorial and technical review has been conducted within
        the RG and the requirements of this process document have been met,
        for example, reviewers should evaluate whether the breadth of review
        the document has received is adequate for the material at hand.
        Finally, reviewers should check that appropriate citations to related
        research literature have been made.</t>

        <t>Reviews should be written to be public. Review comments should be
        sent to the IRSG and RG mailing lists and entered into the IRTF's
        document tracker. All IRSG review comments must be addressed. However,
        the RG need not accept every comment. It is the responsibility of the
        shepherd to understand the comments and ensure that the RG considers
        them, including adequate dialog between the reviewer and the author
        and/or RG.</t>

        <t>Following resolution of the editorial review, the IRSG will make a
        decision as to whether to approve the document for publication. If the
        IRSG does not approve the document, it returns to the research group
        with feedback on what would need to be fixed for publication. In rare
        cases, the IRSG may determine that a document is not suitable for
        publication as an IRTF RFC. (For example, members of the RG may assert
        to the IRSG that there was no RG consensus to publish the document.)
        Other publication streams would still be available to those
        authors.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IESG Review">
        <t>The IRTF Chair will then extend the Internet Engineering Steering
        Group (IESG) an opportunity to review the document according to the
        process and scope described in <xref
        target="RFC5742"></xref>. The scope of this review
        is confined to that described in Section 4.2.3 of <xref target="RFC2026"></xref>
        for non-IETF documents, specifically it is "to ensure
        that the non-standards track Experimental and Informational
        designations are not misused to circumvent the Internet Standards
        Process."</t>

        <t>The IESG (via the IETF Secretariat) is expected to provide the IRTF
        chair and document shepherd with a response, normally within four
        weeks, as to whether publication of the draft is perceived to be at
        odds with the Internet Standards Process.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="RFC Editor Handling">
        <t>The IRTF Chair will then ask the RFC Editor to publish the
        document, after which it will be enqueued for publication.</t>

        <t>The document enters the RFC Editor queue at the same priority as
        non-standard IETF-stream and IAB-stream documents. The document
        shepherd is responsible for ensuring that the document authors are
        responsive to the RFC Editor and that the RFC editing process goes
        smoothly. The AUTH48 review stage of RFC publication is an area where
        the shepherd may be of particular assistance, ensuring a) authors
        respond promptly in reviewing about-to-be-published RFCs and b)
        authors don't inject changes into the document at the last minute
        which would not be supported by the research group or other
        reviewers.</t>

        <t>If not already present, the RFC Editor will insert labels and text
        for the "Status of this Memo" section that identify the document as
        the product of the IRTF. The current text is defined in <xref
        target="RFC5741"></xref>.</t>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Rules for Submission and Use of Material">
      <t>The goals of the IRTF Stream are based on a desire that research
      within the IRTF have broad impact and the publication rights should, in
      general, not restrict republication (with appropriate citations).
      However, in uncommon cases, it may be desirable to publish a document
      that does not permit derivative works. This section, adapted from <xref
      target="RFC5744"></xref>, describes rules and
      procedures supporting these goals. See <xref
      target="RFC5744"></xref> for a discussion of
      the background and rationale for the specific language. (From a
      historical perspective, the goal has been to preserve the rights that
      IRTF authors have previously had when publishing documents as RFC Editor
      Independent Submissions. <xref
      target="RFC5744"></xref> defines those
      rights.)</t>

      <t>IRTF Stream authors will submit their material as Internet-Drafts.
      These drafts will be submitted to, and stored in, the IETF
      Internet-Drafts repository in the same fashion as IETF Internet-Drafts.
      During Internet-Draft submission, authors who intend to submit their
      document for publication in the IRTF Stream will grant rights as
      described in <xref target="RFC5378"></xref>. To request that the
      contribution be published as an RFC that permits no derivative works, an
      author may use the form specified for use with RFC 5378. The IETF Trust
      will indicate that, in cooperation with the IRTF, the Trust grants to
      readers and users of material from IRTF Stream RFCs the right to make
      unlimited derivative works, unless the RFC specifies that no derivative
      works are permitted. This will permit anyone to copy, extract, modify,
      or otherwise use material from IRTF Stream RFCs as long as suitable
      attribution is given. Contributors of Internet-Drafts intended for the
      IRTF Stream will include suitable boilerplate defined by the IETF Trust.
      This boilerplate shall indicate compliance with RFC 5378 and shall
      explicitly indicate either that no derivative works can be based on the
      contribution, or, as is preferred, that unlimited derivative works may
      be crafted from the contribution. It should be understood that the final
      publication decision for the IRTF Stream rests with the IRTF Chair.
      Compliance with these terms is not a guarantee of publication. In
      particular, the IRTF Chair may question the appropriateness of a "no
      derivative works" restriction requested by an author. The
      appropriateness of such usage must be negotiated among the authors and
      the IRTF Chair.</t>

      <section title="Procedures Requested of the IETF Trust">
        <t>The IRTF requests that the IETF Trust and its Trustees assist in
        meeting the goals and procedures set forth in this document. The
        Trustees are requested to publicly confirm their willingness and
        ability to accept responsibility for the Intellectual Property Rights
        for the IRTF Stream. They are also requested to indicate their
        willingness and intent to work according to the procedures and goals
        defined by the IRTF. Specifically, the Trustees are asked to develop
        the necessary boilerplate to enable the suitable marking of documents
        so that the IETF Trust receives the rights as specified in RFC 5378.
        These procedures need to also allow documents to grant either no
        rights to make derivative works, or preferentially, the right to make
        unlimited derivative works from the documents. It is left to the Trust
        to specify exactly how this shall be clearly indicated in each
        document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Patent and Trademark Rules for the IRTF Stream">
        <t>As specified above, contributors of documents for the IRTF stream
        are expected to use the IETF Internet-Draft process, complying therein
        with the rules specified in the latest version of BCP 9, whose version
        at the time of writing was <xref target="RFC2026"></xref>. This
        includes the disclosure of Patent and Trademark issues that are known,
        or can be reasonably expected to be known, to the contributor.
        Disclosure of license terms for patents is also requested, as
        specified in the most recent version of BCP 79. The version of BCP 79
        at the time of this writing was RFC 3979 <xref
        target="RFC3979"></xref>, which is updated by <xref target="RFC4879"></xref>.
        The IRTF Stream has chosen to use the IETF's IPR disclosure mechanism,
        www.ietf.org/ipr/, for this purpose. The IRTF would prefer that the most
        liberal terms possible be made available for specifications published
        as IRTF Stream documents. Terms that do not require fees or licensing
        are preferable. Non-discriminatory terms are strongly preferred over
        those which discriminate among users. However, although disclosure is
        required, there are no specific requirements on the licensing terms
        for intellectual property related to IRTF Stream publication.</t>

    <section title="IAB Statement">
      <t>In its capacity as the body that approves the creation of document
      streams (see <xref target="RFC4844"></xref>), the IAB has reviewed this
      proposal and supports it as an operational change that is in line with
      the respective roles of the IRTF, IESG, and RFC Editor.</t>
