   <abstract>
     <t>
    Operators are looking to introduce services over Segment Routing
    (SR) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in networks running Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering
    (RSVP-TE) LSPs. In some instances, operators are also migrating
    existing services from RSVP-TE to SR LSPs. For example, there
    might be certain services that are well suited for SR and need to
    coexist with RSVP-TE in the same network. Such introduction or
    migration of traffic to SR might require coexistence with RSVP-TE
    in the same network for an extended period of time, depending on
    the operator's intent. The following document provides solution
    options for keeping the traffic engineering database consistent
    across the network, accounting for the different bandwidth
    utilization between SR and RSVP-TE.
     </t>
   </abstract>

   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>
      Introduction of SR <xref target="RFC8402"/> in the same network
      domain as RSVP-TE <xref target="RFC3209"/> presents the problem
      of accounting for SR traffic and making RSVP-TE aware of the
      actual available bandwidth on the network links. RSVP-TE is not
      aware of how much bandwidth is being consumed by SR services on
      the network links; hence, both at computation time (for a
      distributed computation) and at signaling time, RSVP-TE LSPs will
      incorrectly place loads. This is true where RSVP-TE paths are
      distributed or centrally computed without a common entity
      managing both SR and RSVP-TE computation for the entire network
      domain.
     </t><t>
      The problem space can be generalized as a dark bandwidth problem
      to cases where any other service exists in the network that runs
      in parallel across common links and whose bandwidth is not
      reflected in the available and reserved values in the Traffic
      Engineering Database (TED).

      In most practical instances, given
      the static nature of the traffic demands, limiting the
      reservable bandwidth available to RSVP-TE has been an acceptable
      solution. However, in the case of SR traffic, there is assumed
      to be very dynamic traffic demands, and there is considerable
      risk associated with stranding capacity or overbooking service
      traffic resulting in traffic drops.
    </t><t>

      The high-level requirements to consider are:

<list style="numbers">

<t>Placement of SR LSPs in the same domain as RSVP-TE LSPs must not
introduce inaccuracies in the TED used by distributed or centralized
path computation engines.</t>

<t>Engines that compute RSVP-TE paths may have no knowledge of the
existence of the SR paths in the same domain.</t>

<t>Engines that compute RSVP-TE paths should not require a software
upgrade or change to their path-computation logic.</t>

<t>Protocol extensions should be avoided or be minimal as, in many
cases, this coexistence of RSVP-TE and SR may be needed only during a
transition phase.</t>

<t>Placement of SR LSPs in the same domain as RSVP-TE LSPs that are
computed in a distributed fashion must not require migration to a
central controller architecture for the RSVP-TE LSPs.</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

     <section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
        <t>
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
    described in BCP&nbsp;14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> 
    when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
        </t>
     </section>

  <section title="Solution Options">
  <t> The following section lists SR and RSVP coexistence solution
  options. A specific solution is not recommended as all solutions are
  valid, even though some may not satisfy all the requirements. If a
  solution is acceptable for an operator based on their deployment
  model, then such a solution can be chosen.
   </t>
<section title="Static Partitioning of Bandwidth">
<t> In this model, the static reservable bandwidth of an interface can
be statically partitioned between SR and RSVP-TE; each one can operate
within that bandwidth allocation and SHOULD NOT preempt the
other.</t><t>
          
While it is possible to configure RSVP-TE to only reserve up to a
certain maximum link bandwidth and manage the remaining link bandwidth
for other services, this is a deployment where SR and RSVP-TE are
separated in the same network (ships in the night) and can lead to
suboptimal link bandwidth utilization not allowing each to consume
more, if required and constraining the respective deployments.
</t><t> The downside of this approach is the inability to use the
reservable bandwidth effectively and the inability to use bandwidth left
unused by the other protocol.
</t>
</section>     
     <section title="Centralized Management of Available Capacity">
     <t> In this model, a central controller performs path placement
     for both RSVP-TE and SR LSPs. The controller manages and updates
     its own view of the in-use and available capacity. As the
     controller is a single common entity managing the network it can
     have a unified and consistent view of the available capacity at
     all times.  </t>

     <t> A practical drawback of this model is that it
     requires the introduction of a central controller managing the
     RSVP-TE LSPs as a prerequisite to the deployment of any SR
     LSPs. Therefore, this approach is not practical for networks
     where distributed TE with RSVP-TE LSPs is already deployed, as it
     requires a redesign of the network and is not backwards
     compatible. This does not satisfy requirement 5.  </t>

     <t> Note
     that it is not enough for the controller to just maintain the
     unified view of the available capacity, it must also perform the
     path computation for the RSVP-TE LSPs, as the reservations for
     the SR LSPs are not reflected in the TED.
     </t>
     </section>
<section title="Flooding SR Utilization in IGP">
  <t>


Using techniques in <xref target="RFC7810"/>, <xref target="RFC7471"/>,
and <xref target="RFC7823"/>, the SR utilization information can be
flooded in IGP-TE, and the RSVP-TE path computation engine (Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF)) can
be changed to consider this information. This requires changes to the
RSVP-TE path computation logic and would require upgrades in
deployments where distributed computation is done across the network.
</t><t> This does not fit with requirements 3 and 4 mentioned earlier.
</t>
</section>   
<section title="Running SR over RSVP-TE" anchor="sr-over-rsvp">
<t>
SR can run over dedicated RSVP-TE LSPs that carry only SR traffic. In
this model, the LSPs can be one-hop or multi-hop and can provide
bandwidth reservation for the SR traffic based on functionality such
as auto-bandwidth. The model of deployment would be similar in nature
to running LDP over RSVP-TE. This would allow the TED to stay
consistent across the network and any other RSVP-TE LSPs will also be
aware of the SR traffic reservations. In this approach, non-SR traffic
MUST NOT take the SR-dedicated RSVP-TE LSPs, unless required by
policy.  </t>

<t> The drawback of this solution is that it requires SR
to rely on RSVP-TE for deployment. Furthermore, the accounting
accuracy/frequency of this method is dependent on performance of
auto-bandwidth for RSVP-TE. Note that, for this method to work, the
SR-dedicated RSVP-TE LSPs must be set up with the best setup and hold
priorities in the network.
</t>
</section>
<section title="TED Consistency by Reflecting SR Traffic" anchor="ted_sr">
<t>
The solution relies on dynamically measuring SR traffic utilization on
each TE interface and reducing the bandwidth allowed for use by
RSVP-TE. It is assumed that SR traffic receives precedence in terms of
the placement on the path over RSVP traffic (that is, RSVP traffic can
be preempted from the path in case of insufficient resources). This is
logically equivalent to SR traffic having the best preemption priority
in the network. Note that this does not necessarily mean that SR
traffic has higher QoS priority; in fact, SR and RSVP traffic may be
in the same QoS class.  </t>

<t> Reducing the bandwidth allowed for use
by RSVP-TE can be explored using the three parameters available in
IGP-TE (<xref target="RFC5305"/> <xref target="RFC3630"/>), namely
Maximum-Link-Bandwidth, Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth, and
Unreserved-Bandwidth.

</t><t>
        <vspace blankLines="0" />
	<list style="symbols">
	  
  <t> Maximum-Link-Bandwidth: This parameter can be adjusted to
  accommodate the bandwidth required for SR traffic with cascading
  impacts on Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth and
  Unreserved-Bandwidth. However, changing the maximum bandwidth for
  the TE link will prevent any compute engine for SR or RSVP from
  determining the real static bandwidth of the TE link. Further, when
  the Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth is derived from the
  Maximum-Link-Bandwidth, its definition changes since
  Maximum-Link-Bandwidth will account for the SR traffic.</t>
  
<t> Unreserved-Bandwidth: SR traffic could directly adjust the
Unreserved-Bandwidth, without impacting Maximum-Link-Bandwidth or
Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth.  This model is equivalent to the option
described in <xref target="sr-over-rsvp"/>.  Furthermore this would
result in overloading IGP-TE advertisements to directly reflect both
RSVP-TE bandwidth bookings and SR bandwidth measurements.</t>


<t> Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth: As the preferred option, SR traffic
could adjust the Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth, with cascading impact
on the Unreserved-Bandwidth. </t>

</list>
        </t><t> The following methodology can be used at every TE node
        for this solution, using the following parameters:

     <list style="symbols">
       <t>T: Traffic statistics collection time interval.</t>
       
         <t>k: The number of traffic statistics samples that can
         provide a smoothing function to the statistics
         collection. The value of k is a constant integer multiplier
         greater or equal to 1.</t>
	 
         <t>N: Traffic averaging calculation (adjustment) interval
         such that N = k * T.</t>
	 
         <t>Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth: The maximum available
         bandwidth for RSVP-TE.
         </t>


	 <t>
	 If Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE) <xref target="RFC4124"/> is enabled, the Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth SHOULD be interpreted as the aggregate bandwidth constraint across all Class-Types independent of the Bandwidth Constraints model.</t>

	 
         <t>Initial Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth: The
         Maximum-reservable-bandwidth for TE when no SR traffic or
         RSVP-TE reservations exist on the interface.</t>
	 
         <t>RSVP-unreserved-bandwidth-at-priority-X:
         Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth - sum of (existing reservations
         at priority X and all priorities better than X).</t>
	 
         <t>SR traffic threshold percentage: The percentage difference
         of traffic demand that, when exceeded, can result in a change
         to the RSVP-TE Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth.</t>
	 
         <t>IGP-TE update threshold: Specifies the frequency at which
         IGP-TE updates should be triggered based on TE bandwidth
         updates on a link.</t>
	 
         <t>M: An optional multiplier that can be applied to the SR
         traffic average. This multiplier provides the ability to grow
         or shrink the bandwidth used by SR. <xref
         target="Multiplier"/> offers further guidance on M.</t>
	 
       </list> 

</t><t> At every interval T, each node SHOULD collect the SR traffic
statistics for each of its TE interfaces. The measured SR traffic
includes all labeled SR traffic and any traffic entering the SR
network over that TE interface. Further, at every interval N, given a
configured SR traffic threshold percentage and a set of collected SR
traffic statistics samples across the interval N, the SR traffic
average (or any other traffic metric depending on the algorithm used)
over this period is calculated. This method of sampling traffic
statistics and adjusting bandwidth reservation accordingly is similar
to how bandwidth gets adjusted for auto-bandwidth RSVP-TE LSPs.
</t><t>

If the difference between the new calculated SR traffic average and
the current SR traffic average (that was computed in the prior
adjustment) is at least SR traffic threshold percentage, then two
values MUST be updated:


<list style="symbols">
  
  <t>New Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth = Initial Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth - (new SR traffic average * M)</t>
  
<t>New RSVP-unreserved-bandwidth-at-priority-X = New
Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth - sum of (existing reservations at
priority X and all priorities better than X)</t>
</list>

   A DS-TE LSR that advertises a Bandwidth Constraints TLV should update
   the bandwidth constraints for class-types based on operator
   policy. For example, when Russian Dolls Model (RDM) <xref
   target="RFC4127"/> is in use, then only BC0 may be
   updated. Whereas, when Maximum Allocation Model (MAM) <xref
   target="RFC4125"/> is in use, then all Bandwidth Constraints (BCs) may be updated equally
   such that the total value updated is equal to the newly calculated
   SR traffic average.  </t><t>

Note that the computation of the new
RSVP-unreserved-bandwidth-at-priority-X MAY result in RSVP-TE LSPs
being hard or soft preempted. Such preemption will be based on
relative priority (e.g., low to high) between RSVP-TE LSPs. The IGP-TE
update threshold SHOULD allow for more frequent flooding of unreserved
bandwidth. From an operational point of view, an implementation SHOULD
be able to expose both the configured and the actual values of the
Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth.  </t><t>

If LSP preemption is not acceptable, then the RSVP-TE
Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth cannot be reduced below what is currently
reserved by RSVP-TE on that interface. This may result in bandwidth
not being available for SR traffic. Thus, it is required that any
external controller managing SR LSPs SHOULD be able to detect this
situation (for example, by subscribing to TED updates <xref
target="RFC7752"/>) and SHOULD take action to reroute existing SR
paths.  </t><t>

Generically, SR traffic (or any non-RSVP-TE traffic) should have its
own priority allocated from the available priorities. This would allow
SR to preempt other traffic according to the preemption priority
order.  </t><t>

In this solution, the logic to retrieve the statistics, calculating
averages and taking action to change the Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth
is an implementation choice, and all changes are local in
nature. However, note that this is a new network trigger for RSVP-TE
preemption and thus is a consideration for the operator.  </t><t>

The above solution offers the advantage of not introducing new network-wide mechanisms especially during scenarios of migrating to SR in an existing RSVP-TE network and reusing existing protocol mechanisms.

   RSVP-TE are described in <xref target="RFC5920"/>.  The security
