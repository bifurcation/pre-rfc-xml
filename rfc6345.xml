      <t>
        Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA) <xref target='RFC5191'/> 
is a UDP-based protocol to perform Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) authentication between a PANA Client (PaC)  
and a PANA Authentication Agent (PAA).
      </t>
      <t>
   This document specifies PANA Relay Element (PRE) functionality,
   which enables PANA messaging between a PaC and a PAA where the two
   nodes cannot reach each other by means of regular IP routing.  
For example, in ZigBee IP <xref target='ZIGBEEIP'/> that uses 6LoWPAN <xref target='RFC4944'/>, 
a joining node (PaC) can only use a link-local IPv6 address 
to communicate with a parent node prior to PANA authentication.
The PAA typically resides in a 6LowPAN Border Router (6LBR)
   <xref target='6LoWPAN-ND'/>, which is often multiple IP hops 
   away from the PaC.  The PRE implemented on the parent node is used for 
   relaying PANA messages between the PaC and the PAA in this scenario.
      </t>

      <section title="Specification of Requirements">
        <t>
          In this document, several words are used to signify the
          requirements of the specification.  These words are capitalized.  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
          "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
          "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted
          as described in <xref target='RFC2119'/>.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor='section-details' title='PANA Relay Element'>
      <t>
A PANA Relay Element (PRE) is a node that is located between
a PaC and a PAA.  It is responsible for relaying the PANA messages
between the PaC and the PAA.  The PRE does not need to maintain 
per-PaC state.  From the PaC's perspective, the PRE
appears as the PAA.  Normal IP routing is performed between 
the PRE and the PAA.  A PAA can communicate with multiple PREs.  
A PRE can communicate with multiple PAAs, and it will choose one PAA to 
communicate with for a given PaC.  By default, the PaC discovers the PRE 
using the normal mechanism for PAA discovery as defined in <xref target='RFC5192'/>.  
PREs are assumed to be configured with the IP address(es) of the PAA(s).  
Dynamic PAA discovery schemes for PREs are outside the scope of this document.
      </t>
      <t>
The PRE and the PAA support the relay operation as follows.
      </t>
      <t>
When the PRE receives a PANA message from the PaC, it creates a 
PANA-Relay (PRY) message (see <xref target='section-pry-message'/>) 
containing a Relayed-Message AVP 
(see <xref target='section-relayed-message-avp'/>) and 
a PaC-Information AVP (see <xref target='section-pac-information-avp'/>).  
The Relayed-Message AVP encapsulates the entire PANA Message 
received from the PaC.   The PaC-Information AVP contains the 
PaC's IP address and UDP port number used for sending the PANA messages.  
The PRY message is sent to the PAA.  
      </t>
      <t>
When the PAA receives the PRY message, it retrieves the PaC-originated PANA message 
from the Relayed-Message AVP and the PaC's IP address and UDP port 
number from the PaC-Information AVP.  
The PaC-originated PANA message is processed in the same way 
as specified in <xref target='RFC5191'/>, with the following exceptions:
      </t>
      <t>
(a)  The IP address and the port number contained in 
the PaC-Information AVP and the source IP address and UDP port number of 
the PRE are used to identify the PaC among multiple PANA-Client-Initiation 
messages sent from different PaCs through the same PRE or sent from more than 
one PaC with the same the IP address and the port number through different PREs.
      </t>
      <t>
(b) The IP address and the port number contained in 
the PaC-Information AVP are maintained by the PAA in the PANA session attribute 
"IP address and UDP port number of the PaC" <xref target='RFC5191'/>.
      </t>
      <t>
(c) The IP address and UDP port number of the PRE 
are maintained by the PAA in a new PANA session attribute 
"IP address and UDP port number of the PRE".  
A PANA session is referred to as a relayed PANA session 
if this attribute has a non-null value.
      </t>
      <t>
When the PAA originates a PANA message for a relayed PANA session, 
it sends a PRY message to the PRE's IP address and sets the destination 
UDP port number to the UDP port number of the PRE maintained in the
PANA session attribute "IP address and UDP port number of the PRE".
The PRY message includes a Relayed-Message AVP containing 
the PAA-originated PANA message and also includes a PaC-Information 
AVP containing the PaC's IP address and UDP port number.
      </t>
      <t>
When the PRE receives the PRY message, it retrieves the PAA-originated 
PANA message from the Relayed-Message AVP and the PaC's IP address and UDP port number 
from and PaC-Information AVPs.  
The PAA-originated PANA message is sent to the PaC's IP address 
with the source UDP port number set to the PANA port number (716) 
and the destination UDP port number set to the UDP port number contained in
the Relayed-Message AVP.
      </t>
      <t>
The Session Identifier and Sequence Number of any PRY message are set to 
zero.  PRY messages are never retransmitted by the PRE or the PAA.  
Note that the PANA message carried in a Relayed-Message AVP may be retransmitted 
by the PaC or PAA, leading to transmission of a new PRY message carrying the same 
Relayed-Message AVP.
      </t>
      <t>
A PAA that supports this specification MUST be able to process PRY messages 
for PaC-initiated PANA sessions.
      </t>
      <t>
This specification assumes there is at most one PRE between the PaC and
the PAA.  Performing relay operation on a PANA message that is already relayed
(i.e., carried inside a PRY message) is out of scope of this specification.

    <section anchor='section-ipsec' title='Security of Messages Sent between PRE and PAA'>


    <t>
PRE/PAA security is OPTIONAL since PANA messages are designed to be
used in untrusted networks, but if a cryptographic mechanism is
supported, it SHOULD be IPsec. When the device characteristics preclude
support for IPsec, an alternative mechanism such as DTLS <xref target='RFC4347'/>, or
link-layer cryptographic security, etc., may be used instead. This section
describes how IPsec <xref target="RFC4301" /> can be used for securing the PANA relay
messages.
    </t>
    <t>
When IPsec is used, each PRE must have an established pairwise trust relationship with a PAA.  
That is, if messages from a PaC will be relayed by a PRE to a PAA, the PRE and PAA 
must be configured to use IPsec for the messages they exchange.
    </t>
    <t>
PREs and PAAs that support secure PRE to PAA communication use IPsec 
under the following conditions:
    </t>
    <list style='hanging' hangIndent='17'>
      <t hangText='Selectors'>
        PREs are manually configured with the
        addresses of the PAAs to which
        PANA messages are to be forwarded.  PAAs that will 
        be using IPsec for securing PANA messages must also be configured
        with a list of the PREs to which messages
        will be returned.  The selectors for the PREs and PAAs 
        will be the pairs of addresses defining PREs and PAAs that exchange
        PANA messages on the PANA UDP port 716 in their source or destination port.
      </t>
      <t hangText='Mode'>
        PREs and PAAs use transport mode and ESP. The information 
        in PANA messages is not generally considered confidential, so encryption
        need not be used (i.e., NULL encryption can be used).
      </t>
      <t hangText='Key management'>
        Because the PREs and PAA must be manually configured, manually configured key management 
        may suffice, but does not provide defense against replayed messages.
        Accordingly, IKE with preshared secrets SHOULD be supported.  
        IKE with public keys MAY be supported.
      </t>
      <t hangText='Security policy'>
        PANA messages between PREs and PAAs should only be accepted from 
        PANA peers as identified in the local configuration.
      </t>
      <t hangText='Authentication'>
        Shared keys, indexed to the source IP address of
        the received PANA message, are adequate in this application.
      </t>
      <t hangText='Availability'>
        Appropriate IPsec implementations are likely to
        be available for PAAs and for PREs in more featureful devices 
        used in enterprise and core ISP networks.  IPsec is less likely to be
        available for PREs in low-end devices primarily used in the home or small office
        markets.

      <t>
A PRE's main objective is to assist transport of PANA messages between the
PaC and the PAA. Relay operation performed between the PRE and the PAA forms
an additional logical link for relaying the end-to-end PANA messages
between the PaC and the PAA. In that sense, a PRE resembles a bridge or a
router that sits between the PaC and the PAA when non-relayed PANA <xref target='RFC5191'/>
is used.  
      </t>
      <t>
A PRE can pose certain threats to the relayed PANA messages. A PRE can delay
or drop PANA messages sent by the PaC or the PAA. It can also spoof or
modify PANA messages sent towards the PaC or the PAA. These threats are
similar to what an on-path bridge/router (i.e., a man-in-the-middle, MitM)
can pose to non-relayed PANA. EAP and PANA protocols are designed to operate
over unsecure links where aforementioned threats can already exist. Even
though these threats cannot be leveraged to gain unauthorized network
access, or compromise of cryptographic keys (e.g., MK, MSK, EMSK, etc.),
other damages such as preventing authentication to complete, or denial-of
service are still possible. 
      </t>
      <t>
Even though the PRE-to-PAA relay path appears to be a separate additional
logical link for transporting the PANA messages, the PRE may pose a few additional
risks versus traditional on-path bridges and routers. The following explains
the risks and mitigations of PRE as a relay device.
      </t>
      <t>
The PRE inserts PaC-Information AVP as the PaC-generated PANA packet is
encapsulated in a PRY packet to the PAA. This AVP carries the IP address and
the UDP port number values of the PANA packet as sent by the PAC. These
values are already carried inside the IP and UDP headers with non-relayed
PANA and they are not necessarily secured. EAP and PANA are designed to work
in the absence of their protection. Therefore, no additional PANA-layer
security is needed when these values are carried as PANA AVPs between the
PRE and the PAA. If a future document defines additional payload AVPs for
the PRY messages, there may be a need to define additional security for
those messages.  
      </t>
      <t>
A rogue PRE can spoof PANA messages on behalf of a victim PaC and receive
the PAA response irrespective of the location of the PRE with 
respect to the network topology. 
Achieving the same threat with non-relayed PANA requires
the rogue node be an MitM, otherwise the spoofed packets may be dropped by
the ingress filtering network elements, or the responses would be directly
sent to the victim PaC IP address and may not be received by the rogue node.
Nevertheless, such a rogue PRE cannot perform full initial authentication on
behalf of the victim PaC unless it also holds the PaC's credentials
(including the master key). Furthermore, any spoofed PANA messages after the
initial authentication will fail the integrity checks at the PAA when a
key-generating EAP method is used. 
      </t>
      <t>
The only state that can change on the PAA upon a rogue PRE sending a spoofed
PRY is the IP address and UDP port number of the PRE stored as PANA session
attributes, which impacts where the PAA sends the next PANA packet (i.e., to
the rogue PRE instead of the legitimate PRE). The PAA also needs to handle
the PaC-Information AVP in addition to the PaC-originated PANA message
carried in the Relayed-Message AVP, so use of the PRE may impose additional
storage requirements on the PAA. 
A rogue PRE generating a valid PANA packet requires it be a MitM in
order to synch up with the PANA session state and attributes on the PaC.
Such a MitM can already disturb the EAP and PANA even without playing the
role of a PRE.
      </t>
      <t>
An unauthorized node pretending as PAA can spoof the relayed PANA messages
to the PRE in order to get them delivered to the PaC. While the harm caused
by such spoofed packets are limited (due to the EAP and PANA design with
unsecured network operation in mind), the processing of bogus packets can cause
processing load on the PaC.
      </t>
      <t>
Some of the risks stemming from the aforementioned threats are already
handled by the EAP and PANA as described. The residual risks shall be
mitigated using additional physical or cryptographic security in the network
hosting the PREs and the PAAs.  Access control lists implemented on the PRE,
PAA, or intermediary firewalls supported by cryptographic or physical 
authentication/authorization are needed for protecting legitimate PRE and PAAs 
against rogue ones. Details of the cryptographic mechanisms using IPsec are specified 
in <xref target='section-ipsec'/>.  Use of manually configured preshared keys for IPsec 
between PREs and PAAs does not defend against replayed PANA messages. 

      </t>
      <t>
PREs do not need to maintain per-PaC state; therefore, they are robust
against resource consumption DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks.     
<!-- 
However,
PREs may maintain per-PaC state to provide additional security based on the
transaction sequence being relayed. 
--> 
      </t>
    <t>
In the relay operation, the IP address of the PAA that is seen by the PaC 
(i.e., an IP address of the PRE) is different from the IP address of the PAA that 
is seen by the authentication server. 
If an EAP channel binding solution uses the IP address of the PAA 
as part of channel binding parameters, such a solution must take this into account. 
Note that the same issue arises even when non-relayed PANA is used and the PAA has 
one IP address configured on its interface facing the PaC and 
another IP address on the other interface facing the authentication server.

<abstract><t>The IETF 6LoWPAN working group defines IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Networks such as IEEE 802.15.4.  This and other similar link technologies have limited or no usage of multicast signaling due to energy conservation.  In addition, the wireless network may not strictly follow traditional concept of IP subnets and IP links.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery was not designed for non-transitive wireless links.  The traditional IPv6 link concept and heavy use of multicast make the protocol inefficient and sometimes impractical in a low power and lossy network.  This document describes simple optimizations to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, addressing mechanisms and duplicate address detection for 6LoWPAN and similar networks.</t></abstract>
