	<abstract>
		<t> This document defines an extensible format and MIME type
		    that may be used by mail operators to report feedback
		    about received email to other parties.  This format is
		    intended as a machine-readable replacement for various
		    existing report formats currently used in Internet
		    email. </t>
	</abstract>
</front>

<middle>
	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> As the spam problem continues to expand and potential
		    solutions evolve, mail operators are increasingly
		    exchanging abuse reports among themselves and other
		    parties.  However, different operators have defined their
		    own formats, and thus the receivers of these reports are
		    forced to write custom software to interpret each of them.  In
		    addition, many operators use various other report formats
		    to provide non-abuse-related feedback about processed
		    email.

  This memo uses the "multipart/report"
		    content type defined in <xref target="REPORT"/>, and
		    in that context defines a standard extensible
		    format by creating the "message/feedback-report"
		    <xref target="MIME"/> type for these reports. </t>

		<t> While there has been previous work in this area (e.g.,
		    <xref target="STRADS-BCP"/> and
		    <xref target="ASRG-ABUSE"/>), none of it has yet been
		    successful.  It is hoped that this document will have a
		    better fate. </t>

		<t> This format is intended primarily as an Abuse Reporting
		    Format (ARF) for reporting email abuse but also includes
		    support for direct feedback via end user mail clients,
		    reports of some types of virus activity, and some similar
		    issues.  This memo also contains provision for extensions
		    should other specific types of reports be desirable in
		    the future. </t>

		<t> This document only defines the format and
		    <xref target="MIME"/> content type to be used for these
		    reports.  Determination of where these reports should be
		    sent, validation of their contents, and how trust among
		    report generators and report recipients is established
		    are outside the scope of this document.  It is assumed
		    that best practices will evolve over time, and will be
		    codified in future documents. </t>

		<section anchor="purpose" title="Purpose">
			<t> The reports defined in this document are intended
			    to inform mail operators about:

			    <list style="symbols">
				<t> email abuse originating from their
				    networks; </t>

				<t> potential issues with the perceived
				    quality of outbound mail, such as email
				    service providers sending mail that
				    attracts the attention of automated abuse
 				    detection systems. </t>
			    </list> </t>

			<t> Please note that while the parent
			    "multipart/report" content type defined in
			    <xref target="REPORT"/> is used for all kinds of
			    administrative messages, this format is intended
			    specifically for communications among providers
			    regarding email abuse and related issues, and
			    SHOULD NOT be used for other reports. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="requirements" title="Requirements">
			<t> The following requirements are necessary for
			    feedback reports (the actual specification is
			    defined later in this document):

			    <list style="symbols">
				<t> They must be both human and machine
				    readable; </t>

				<t> A copy of the original email message
				    (both body and header) or the message
				    header must be enclosed in order to allow
				    the receiver to handle the report
				    properly; </t>

				<t> The machine-readable section must provide
				    ability for the report generators to share
				    meta-data with receivers; </t>

				<t> The format must be extensible. </t>

	</section>

	<section anchor="format"
	         title="Format of Email Feedback Reports">
		<t> To satisfy the requirements, an email feedback report is
		    defined as a <xref target="MIME"/> message with a top-level
		    MIME content type of "multipart/report" (as defined in
		    <xref target="REPORT"/>). The following apply:

		    <list style="letters">
			<t> The "report-type" parameter of the
			    "multipart/report" type is set to
			    "feedback-report"; </t>

			<t> The first MIME part of the message contains a
			    human-readable description of the report and
			    MUST be included. </t>

			<t> The second MIME part of the message is a
			    machine-readable section with the content type of
			    "message/feedback-report" (defined later in this
			    memo) and MUST be included.  This section is
			    intended to convey meta-data about the report in
			    question that may not be readily available from
			    the included email message itself. </t>

			<t> The third MIME part of the message is either
			    of type "message/rfc822" (as defined in
			    <xref target="MIME-TYPES"/>) and contains the
			    original message in its entirety OR is of type 
			    "text/rfc822-headers" (as defined in
			    <xref target="REPORT"/>) and contains a copy of the
			    entire header block from the original message.
			    This part MUST be included (contrary to
			    <xref target="REPORT"/>).  While some operators
			    may choose to modify or redact this portion for
			    privacy or legal reasons, it is RECOMMENDED that
			    the entire original email message be included
			    without any modification as such modifications
			    can impede forensic work by the recipient of
			    this report.  See <xref target="security"/>
			    for further discussion. </t>

			<t> Except as discussed below, each feedback report
			    MUST be related to only a single email message.
			    Summary and aggregate formats are outside of the
			    scope of this specification. </t>

			<t> The Subject header field of the feedback report
			    SHOULD be the same as the included email message
			    about which the report is being generated.  If
			    it differs, the difference MUST be limited to
			    only a typical forwarding prefix used by Mail User Agents (MUAs) such
			    as "FW:". (Many smaller operators using MUAs for
			    abuse handling rely on the subject lines for
			    processing.) </t>

			<t> The primary evidence of the abuse being reported
			    is found in the third part of the report, which
			    contains the original message.  The second
			    part contains additional derived data that may
			    help the receiver, but in terms of selecting
			    actionable report data, report recipients SHOULD
			    use the content of the third part first, then data
			    from the second part.  The first part is meant
			    to contain explanatory text for human use but
			    is not itself a part of the report, and SHOULD
			    NOT be used if it is in conflict with the
			    other parts. </t>
		    </list> </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="format2"
	         title="The 'message/feedback-report' Content Type">
		<t> A new <xref target="MIME"/> content type called
		    "message/feedback-report" is defined.  This content type
		    provides a machine-readable section intended to let the
		    report generator convey meta-data to the report receiver.
		    The intent of this section is to convey information that
		    may not be obvious or may not be easily extracted from
		    the original email message body or header. </t>

		<t> The body of this content type consists of multiple
		    "fields" formatted according to the ABNF of
		    <xref target="MAIL"/> header fields.  This section defines
		    the initial set of fields provided by this specification.
		    Additional fields may be registered according to the
		    procedure described later in this memo.  Although these
		    fields have a syntax similar to those of mail message
		    header fields, they are semantically distinct; hence, they
		    SHOULD NOT be repeated as header fields of the message
		    containing the report.  Note that these fields represent
		    information that the receiver is asserting about the
		    report in question, but are not necessarily verifiable.
		    Report receivers MUST NOT assume that these assertions are
		    always accurate. </t>

		<t> Note that the above limitation in no way restricts the
		    use of message header fields that are registered in the
		    IANA header field registry with the same field names. </t>

		<section anchor="required_fields"
		         title="Required Fields">
			<t> The following report header fields MUST appear
			    exactly once:
			    <list style="symbols">
				<t> "Feedback-Type" contains the type of
				    feedback report (as defined in the
				    corresponding IANA registry and later in
				    this memo). This is intended to let report
				    parsers distinguish among different types
				    of reports. </t>

				<t> "User-Agent" indicates the name and
				    version of the software program that
				    generated the report.  The format of this
				    field MUST follow section 14.43 of
				    <xref target="HTTP"/>.  This field is for
				    documentation only; there is no registry
				    of user agent names or versions, and
				    report receivers SHOULD NOT expect user
				    agent names to belong to a known set. </t>

				<t> "Version" indicates the version of
				    specification that the report generator is
				    using to generate the report. The version
				    number in this specification is set to
				    "1". </t>
			    </list> </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="optional_once"
		         title="Optional Fields Appearing Once">
			<t> The following header fields are optional and MUST
			    NOT appear more than once:

			    <list style="symbols">
				<t> "Original-Envelope-Id" contains the
				    envelope ID string used in the original
				    <xref target="SMTP"/> transaction (see
				    section 2.2.1 of
				    <xref target="DSN"/>). </t>

				<t> "Original-Mail-From" contains a copy of
				    the email address used in the MAIL FROM
				    portion of the original SMTP transaction.
				    The format of this field is defined in
				    section 4.1.2 of <xref target="SMTP"/> as
				    "Reverse-path". </t>

				<t> "Arrival-Date" indicates the date and time
				    at which the original message was received
				    by the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) of the generating ADMD
				    (Administrative Management Domain). 

 This
				    field MUST be formatted as per section
				    3.3 of <xref target="MAIL"/>. </t>

				<t> "Reporting-MTA" indicates the name of the
				    MTA generating this feedback report.  This
				    field is defined in section 2.2.2 of
				    <xref target="DSN"/>, except that it is an
				    optional field in this report. </t>

				<t> "Source-IP" contains an IPv4 or IPv6
				    address of the MTA from which the original
				    message was received.  Addresses MUST be
				    formatted as per section 4.1.3 of
				    <xref target="SMTP"/>. </t>

				<t> "Incidents" contains an unsigned 32-bit
				    integer indicating the number of incidents
				    this report represents.  The absence of
				    this field implies the report covers a
				    single incident. </t>
			    </list> </t>

			<t> The historic field "Received-Date" SHOULD also be
			    accepted and interpreted identically to
			    "Arrival-Date".  However, if both are present,
			    the report is malformed and SHOULD be treated as
			    described in <xref target="malformed"/>. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="optional_many"
		         title="Optional Fields Appearing Multiple Times">
			<t> The following set of header fields are optional
			    and may appear any number of times as appropriate:

			    <list style="symbols">
				<t> "Authentication-Results" indicates the
				    result of one or more authentication checks
				    run by the report generator.  The format
				    of this field is defined in
				    <xref target="AUTH-RESULTS"/>.  Report
				    receivers should note that this field only
				    indicates an assertion made by the report
				    generator. </t>

				<t> "Original-Rcpt-To" includes a copy of the
				    email address used in the RCPT TO portion
				    of the original <xref target="SMTP"/>
				    transaction.  The format of this field is
				    a "Reverse-path" defined in section 4.1.2
				    of that memo.  This field SHOULD be
				    repeated for every SMTP recipient seen by
				    the report generator. </t>

				<t> "Reported-Domain" includes a domain name
				    that the report generator believes to be
				    relevant to the report, e.g., the domain
				    whose apparent actions provoked the
				    generation of the report.  It is
				    unspecified how the report generator
				    determines this information, and thus the
				    report receiver cannot be certain how it
				    was chosen.  It is often used as a means
				    of suggesting to the report receiver
				    how this report might be handled.  In
				    cases where the derivation is not obvious,
				    the report generator is encouraged to
				    clarify in the text section of the
				    report.  Domain format is defined in
				    section 2.3.1 of
				    <xref target="DNS"/>. </t>

				<t> "Reported-URI" indicates a URI that the
				    report generator believes to be relevant
				    to the report, e.g., a suspect URI that was
				    found in the message that caused the report
				    to be generated.  The same caveats about
				    the origin of the value of
				    "Reported-Domain" apply to this field.
				    The URI format is defined in
				    <xref target="URI"/>. </t>
			    </list></t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="uris" title="Notes about URIs">
			<t> Implementors should be aware that the
			    Reported-URI field can carry many different types
			    of data depending on the URI scheme used. For
			    more information, please consult the "URI
			    Schemes" registry maintained by IANA. </t>

			<t> Furthermore, it is outside the scope of this

		<t> When an agent that accepts and handles ARF messages

		    ARF message but syntactically deviates from this
		    specification, that agent SHOULD ignore or reject

		    notice (either via an <xref target="SMTP"/> reply or

	<section anchor="transport" title="Transport Considerations">
		<t> <xref target="DSN"/> requires that its reports
		    be sent with the empty <xref target="SMTP"/> envelope
		    sender to avoid bounce loops.  A similar requirement
		    was considered for this specification, but it seems
		    unlikely that an ARF report would be generated
		    in response to receipt of an ARF report, and furthermore
		    such a requirement would prevent an ARF generator from
		    ever determining that an ARF report was not actually
		    received. </t>

		<t> On the other hand, if an ARF report is generated without
		    the empty envelope sender and is sent to an address that
		    actually does not work, then the generating address
		    can also be overwhelmed by DSNs as a denial-of-service
		    attack (see <xref target="sc-autogen"/>). </t>

		<t> This specification therefore makes no requirement related
		    to the envelope sender of a generated report.  Operators
		    will have to consider what envelope sender to use

	<section anchor="extensibility" title="Extensibility">
		<t> Like many other formats and protocols, this format may
		    need to be extended over time to fit the ever-changing

		    provided via two IANA registries: one for feedback types
		    and a second for report header fields.  The feedback type
		    registry is to be used in conjunction with the
		    "Feedback-Type" field above.  The header name registry is
		    intended for registration of new meta-data fields to be
		    used in the machine-readable portion (part 2) of this
		    format.  Please note that version numbers do not
		    change with new field registrations unless a new
		    specification of this format is published.  Also, note that
		    all new field registrations may only be registered as
		    optional fields.  Any new required fields REQUIRE a new
		    version of this specification to be published. </t>

		<t> In order to encourage extensibility and interoperability
		    of this format, implementors MUST ignore any fields or

		<t> Additional report types (extension report types) or

		<t> Experimental report types and report header fields MUST
		    only be used between ADMDs that have explicitly consented
		    to use them.  These names and the parameters associated
		    with them are not documented in RFCs.  Therefore, they are

	<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
		<t> The following security considerations apply when
		    generating or processing a feedback report: </t>

		<section anchor="sc-inherited" title="Inherited from RFC 3462">
			<t> All of the Security Considerations from
			    <xref target="REPORT"/> are inherited here. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="sc-interpretation" title="Interpretation">
			<t> This specification describes a report format.
			    The authentication and validity of the content of
			    the report SHOULD be established through other
			    means.  The content of an unvetted report could
			    be wrong, incomplete or deliberately false,
			    including the alleged abuse incident in the third
			    part, derived data in the second part or the
			    human-readable first part. </t>

			<t> There will be some desire to perform some actions
			    in an automated fashion in order to enact timely
			    responses to common feedback reports.
			    Caution must be taken, however, as there is no
			    substantial security around the content of these
			    reports.  An attacker could craft a report
			    meant to generate undesirable actions on the
			    part of a report recipient. </t>

			<t> It is suggested that the origin of an ARF report
			    be vetted, such as by using common message
			    authentication schemes like
			    <xref target="SMIME"/>, <xref target="DKIM"/>,
			    <xref target="SPF"/>, or <xref target="SENDERID"/>,
			    prior to the undertaking of any kind of automated
			    action in response to receipt of the report.  In
			    particular, S/MIME offers the strongest
			    authentication and the cost of key exchange is
			    assumed in the process of establishing a bilateral
			    reporting relationship that uses this
			    specification; however, it is not as transparent
			    as the others and thus will interfere with the
			    parsing capabilities of code that is designed
			    specifically to handle multipart/report
			    messages. </t>

			<t> The details of the required validation to achieve
			    this are a matter of local policy and are thus
			    outside the scope of this specification. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="sc-method-attacks"
		         title="Attacks against Authentication Methods">
			<t> If an attack becomes known against an
			    authentication method, clearly then the agent
			    verifying that method can be fooled into thinking
			    an inauthentic message is authentic, and thus
			    the value of this header field can be misleading.
			    It follows that any attack against an
			    authentication method that might be used to
			    protect the authenticity of an abuse report is
			    also a security consideration here. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="sc-bugs"
		         title="Intentionally Malformed Reports">
			<t> It is possible for an attacker to generate an
			    ARF message field that is extraordinarily large
			    or otherwise malformed in an attempt to discover
			    or exploit weaknesses in recipient parsing code.
			    Implementors SHOULD thoroughly verify all such
			    messages and be robust against intentionally as
			    well as unintentionally malformed messages. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="sc-omitted-data"
		         title="Omitting Data from ARF Reports">
			<t> The sending of these reports can reveal possibly
			    private information about the person sending the
			    report.  For example, such a report sent in
			    response to a mailing list posting will reveal to
			    the report recipient a valid email address on the
			    list that might otherwise have remained
			    hidden. </t>

			<t> For this reason, report generators might wish to
			    redact portions of the report to conceal private
			    information.  Doing so could be necessary where
			    privacy trumps operational necessity, but, as
			    mentioned in <xref target="format"/>, it might
			    impede a timely or meaningful response from the
			    report recipient. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="sc-autogen"
		         title="Automatically Generated ARF Reports">
			<t> Systems have been implemented that generate ARF
			    reports automatically in response to an event.
			    For example, software monitoring a honeypot email
			    address might generate an ARF report immediately
			    upon delivery of any message to it.  An attacker
			    that becomes aware of such a configuration can
			    exploit it to attack an ARF recipient with
			    automatically generated ARF reports. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="sc-viruses" title="Attached Malware">
			<t> As this format is sometimes used to automatically
			    report malware, ARF processors (human or otherwise)
			    SHOULD ensure that attachments are processed in
			    a manner appropriate for unverified and potentially
			    hostile data. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="sc-user-agent" title="The User-Agent Field">
			<t> Further to <xref target="sc-interpretation"/>,
			    the User-Agent field is an assertion of the
			    generating software and is neither specified in
			    this memo nor derived from the message represented
			    in the third part of the report.  It is intended
			    for documentation and debugging, and since it is
			    trivially forged by a malicious agent, it SHOULD
			    NOT be interpreted by recipients. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="sc-malformed" title="Malformed Messages">
			<t> Further to the discussion in
			    <xref target="malformed"/>, there might be cases
			    where an ARF processing agent elects to accept
			    messages not consistent with this specification,
			    such as during transition periods where some
			    fields are moving toward "historic" or 
			    "deprecated" status, or the introduction of new
			    non-standard extension or experimental fields.
			    Such choices need to be implemented with
			    extreme caution; where two different fields
			    have related meaning (e.g., "Received-Date", which
			    is historic, and "Arrival-Date", which is current),
			    an attacker could craft a report that makes
			    a confusing claim in an attempt to exploit such
			    liberal parsing logic. </t>

<t>Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax.  Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<t>This memo defines a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) content-type that may be used by a message transfer agent (MTA) or electronic mail gateway to report the result of an attempt to deliver a message to one or more recipients.  This content-type is intended as a machine-processable replacement for the various types of delivery status notifications currently used in Internet electronic mail.  Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other messaging systems (such as X.400 or the so-called "Local Area Network (LAN)-based" systems), the Delivery Status Notification (DSN) protocol is designed to be useful in a multi-protocol messaging environment.  To this end, the protocol described in this memo provides for the carriage of "foreign" addresses and error codes, in addition to those normally used in Internet mail.  Additional attributes may also be defined to support "tunneling" of foreign notifications through Internet mail. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<t>
   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
   protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
   systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for
   many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and
   distributed object management systems, through extension of its
   request methods, error codes and headers . A feature of HTTP is
   the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems
   to be built independently of the data being transferred.
</t>
<t>

   HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information
   initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol
   referred to as "HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068 .

<abstract>
<t>STD 11, RFC 822, defines a message representation protocol specifying considerable detail about US-ASCII message headers, and leaves the message content, or message body, as flat US-ASCII text.  This set of documents, collectively called the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, or MIME, redefines the format of messages to allow for</t>

<t>(1)   textual message bodies in character sets other than US-ASCII,</t>
<t>(2)   an extensible set of different formats for non-textual message bodies,</t>
<t>(3)   multi-part message bodies, and</t>
<t>(4)   textual header information in character sets other than US-ASCII.</t>
<t>These documents are based on earlier work documented in RFC 934, STD 11, and RFC 1049, but extends and revises them.  Because RFC 822 said so little about message bodies, these documents are largely orthogonal to (rather than a revision of) RFC 822.</t>
<t>This initial document specifies the various headers used to describe the structure of MIME messages. The second document, RFC 2046, defines the general structure of the MIME media typing system and defines an initial set of media types. The third document, RFC 2047, describes extensions to RFC 822 to allow non-US-ASCII text data in Internet mail header fields. The fourth document, RFC 2048, specifies various IANA registration procedures for MIME-related facilities. The fifth and final document, RFC 2049, describes MIME conformance
  criteria as well as providing some illustrative examples of MIME message formats, acknowledgements, and the bibliography.</t>
<t>These documents are revisions of RFCs 1521, 1522, and 1590, which themselves were revisions of RFCs 1341 and 1342.  An appendix in RFC 2049 describes differences and changes from previous versions.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>The Multipart/Report Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) content-type is a general "family" or "container" type for electronic mail reports of any kind.  Although this memo defines only the use of the Multipart/Report content-type with respect to delivery status reports, mail processing programs will benefit if a single content-type is used to for all kinds of reports.  This document is part of a four document set describing the delivery status report service.  This collection includes the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) extensions to request delivery status reports, a MIME content for the reporting of delivery reports, an enumeration of extended status codes, and a multipart container for the delivery report, the original message, and a human-friendly summary of the failure.

<t>
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification
defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI
reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative
grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual
specifications of each URI scheme.

<t>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) defines a domain-level authentication framework for email using public-key cryptography and key server technology to permit verification of the source and contents of messages by either Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) or Mail User Agents (MUAs).  The ultimate goal of this framework is to permit a signing domain to assert responsibility for a message, thus protecting message signer identity and the integrity of the messages they convey while retaining the functionality of Internet email as it is known today.  Protection of email identity may assist in the global control of "spam" and "phishing". [STANDARDS TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>Over its thirty-five-year history, Internet Mail has changed significantly in scale and complexity, as it has become a global infrastructure service.  These changes have been evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, reflecting a strong desire to preserve both its installed base and its usefulness.  To collaborate productively on this large and complex system, all participants need to work from a common view of it and use a common language to describe its components and the interactions among them.  But the many differences in perspective currently make it difficult to know exactly what another participant means.  To serve as the necessary common frame of reference, this document describes the enhanced Internet Mail architecture, reflecting the current service.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract></front>

<t>Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).&lt;/t>&lt;t> In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This document obsoletes RFC 2434.
