<abstract>

<t>	
Internet mail was originally limited to 7-bit ASCII. MIME added
support for the use of 8-bit character sets in body parts, and
also defined an encoded-word construct so other character sets could
be used in certain header field values. However, full internationalization of
electronic mail requires additional enhancements to allow the use of Unicode,
including characters outside the ASCII repertoire, in mail addresses as well
as direct use of Unicode in header fields like "From:", "To:", and "Subject:",
without requiring the use of complex encoded-word constructs.
This document specifies an enhancement to the Internet Message Format and to
MIME that allows use of Unicode  in mail addresses and most header field content.
</t>

<t>
This specification updates Section 6.4 of RFC 2045 to eliminate the
restriction prohibiting the use of non-identity content-transfer-encodings
on subtypes of "message/". 
</t>

</abstract>
</front>

<middle>

<section title="Introduction" anchor="INT">

<t>	
Internet mail distinguishes a message from its transport and further
divides a message between a header and a body <xref target="RFC5322"/>.
Internet mail  header field values contain a variety of strings that are
intended to be user-visible. The range of supported characters for these
strings was originally limited to <xref target="ASCII"/> in 7-bit form. MIME
<xref target="RFC2045"/> <xref target="RFC2046"/> <xref target="RFC2047"/>
provides the ability to use additional character sets, but this support is
limited to body part data and to special encoded-word constructs that were
only allowed in a limited number of places in header field values.
</t>

<t>
Globalization of the Internet requires support of the much larger set of
characters provided by Unicode <xref target="RFC5198"/> in both mail
addresses and most header field values. Additionally, complex encoding
schemes like encoded-words introduce inefficiencies as well as
significant opportunities for processing errors. And finally,
native support for the UTF-8 charset is now available on most systems.
Hence, it is strongly desirable for Internet mail to support UTF-8 
<xref target="RFC3629"/> directly.
</t>

<t>
This document specifies an enhancement to the Internet Message Format
<xref target="RFC5322"/> and to MIME that permits the direct use of UTF-8,
rather than only ASCII, in header field values, including mail addresses.
A new media type, message/global, is defined for messages that use this
extended format. This specification also lifts the MIME restriction on having
non-identity content-transfer-encodings on any subtype of the
message top-level type so that message/global parts can be safely
transmitted across existing mail infrastructure.
</t>

<t>
This specification is based on a model of native, end-to-end support
for UTF-8,  which depends on having an "8-bit-clean" environment assured by
the transport system. Support for carriage across legacy, 7-bit infrastructure
and for processing by 7-bit receivers requires additional mechanisms that are
not provided by these specifications.
</t>

<t>
This specification is a revision of and replacement for <xref target="RFC5335" />.
Section 6 of <xref target="RFC6530" /> describes the change
in approach between this specification and the previous version.
</t>

</section>


<section title="Terminology Used in This Specification">

<t>
A plain ASCII string is fully compatible with <xref target="RFC5321" /> and
<xref target="RFC5322" />. In this document, non-ASCII strings are UTF-8
strings if they are in header field values that contain at least
one &lt;UTF8&nbhy;non&nbhy;ascii&gt; (see <xref target="Normalization"/>).
</t>

<t>
Unless otherwise noted, all terms used here are defined in
<xref target="RFC5321"/>, <xref target="RFC5322"/>, 
<xref target="RFC6530" />, or
<xref target="RFC6531"/>.
</t>

<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.
</t>

<t>
The term "8-bit" means octets are present in the data with values above 0x7F.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Changes to Message Header Fields">

<t>
To permit non-ASCII Unicode characters in field values, the header definition in 
<xref target="RFC5322"/> is extended to support the new format.
The following sections specify the necessary changes to RFC 5322's ABNF.
</t>

<t>
The syntax rules not mentioned below remain defined as in
<xref target="RFC5322"/>.
</t>

<t>
Note that this protocol does not change rules in RFC 5322 for defining
header field names. The bodies of header fields are allowed to contain Unicode
characters, but the header field names themselves must consist of ASCII
characters only.
</t>

<t>
Also note that messages in this format require the use of the &EAISMTPkeyword;
extension <xref target="RFC6531"/> to be transferred via SMTP.
</t>

<section title="UTF-8 Syntax and Normalization" anchor="Normalization">

<t>
UTF-8 characters can be defined in terms of octets using the following 
ABNF <xref target="RFC5234"/>, taken from <xref target="RFC3629"/>:

<figure><artwork type="abnf">
<![CDATA[
UTF8-non-ascii  =   UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4

UTF8-2          =   <Defined in Section 4 of RFC3629>

UTF8-3          =   <Defined in Section 4 of RFC3629>
					
UTF8-4          =   <Defined in Section 4 of RFC3629>
]]>
</artwork></figure>

</t>	

<t>	
See <xref target="RFC5198"/> for a discussion of Unicode normalization; 
<xref target="UNF">normalization form NFC</xref> SHOULD be used. Actually, if
one is going to do internationalization properly, one of the most often cited
goals is to permit people to spell their names correctly. Since many mailbox
local parts reflect personal names, that principle applies to mailboxes as
well. The <xref target="UNF">NFKC normalization form</xref> SHOULD NOT be
used because it may lose information that is needed to correctly spell some
names in some unusual circumstances.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Syntax Extensions to RFC 5322" anchor="syntax_change">

<t>
The following rules extend the ABNF syntax defined in
<xref target="RFC5322"/> and <xref target="RFC5234"/> in order to allow UTF-8
content.

<figure><artwork type="abnf"><![CDATA[
VCHAR   =/  UTF8-non-ascii

ctext   =/  UTF8-non-ascii

atext   =/  UTF8-non-ascii

qtext   =/  UTF8-non-ascii

text    =/  UTF8-non-ascii
              ; note that this upgrades the body to UTF-8

dtext   =/  UTF8-non-ascii
]]>
</artwork></figure>
</t>

<t>
The preceding changes mean that the following constructs now allow UTF-8:
</t>

<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>
Unstructured text, used in header fields like "Subject:" or "Content-description:".
</t>
<t>
Any construct that uses atoms, including but not limited to the local parts of
addresses and Message-IDs. This includes addresses in the "for" clauses of
"Received:" header fields.
</t>
<t>
Quoted strings.
</t>
<t>
Domains.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
Note that header field names are not on this list; these are still restricted to
ASCII.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Use of 8-bit UTF-8 in Message-IDs">

<t>
Implementers of Message-ID generation algorithms MAY prefer to restrain
their output to ASCII since that has some advantages, such as
when constructing "In-reply-to:" and "References:" header fields in mailing-list
threads where some senders use internationalized addresses and
others do not.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Effects on Line Length Limits">

<t>
Section 2.1.1 of <xref target="RFC5322"/> limits lines to 998 characters
and recommends that the lines be restricted to only 78 characters. This
specification changes the former limit to 998 octets. (Note that, in ASCII,
octets and characters are effectively the same, but this is not true in UTF-8.)
The 78-character limit remains defined in terms of characters, not octets, since
it is intended to address display width issues, not line-length issues.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Changes to MIME Message Type Encoding Restrictions"
anchor="change_to_message_encoding">

<t>
This specification updates Section 6.4 of <xref target="RFC2045"/>. 
<xref target="RFC2045"/> prohibits applying a content-transfer-encoding  
to any subtypes of "message/".  This specification relaxes that rule -- it allows
newly defined MIME types to permit content-transfer-encoding, and it allows
content-transfer-encoding for message/global (see <xref target="utf8smtp"/>).
</t>

<t>
Background: Normally, transfer of message/global will be done in
8-bit-clean channels, and body parts will have "identity" encodings,
that is, no decoding is necessary.
</t>

<t>
But in the case where a message containing a message/global is downgraded
from 8-bit to 7-bit as described in <xref target="RFC6152"/>, an encoding
might have to be applied to the message. If the message travels multiple times 
between a 7-bit environment and an environment implementing these extensions,
multiple levels of encoding may occur. This is expected to be rarely 
seen in practice, and the potential complexity of other ways of dealing
with the issue is thought to be larger than the complexity of allowing 
nested encodings where necessary.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Use of MIME Encoded-Words">

<t>
The MIME encoded-words facility <xref target="RFC2047"/> provides the ability
to place non-ASCII text, but only in a subset of the places allowed by this extension.
Additionally, encoded-words are substantially more complex since they allow the
use of arbitrary charsets. Accordingly, encoded-words SHOULD NOT be used when
generating header fields for messages employing this extension. Agents MAY, when
incorporating material from another message, convert encoded-word use to
direct use of UTF-8.
</t>

<t>
Note that care must be taken when decoding encoded-words because the results
after replacing an encoded-word with its decoded equivalent in UTF-8 may be
syntactically invalid. Processors that elect to decode encoded-words MUST NOT
generate syntactically invalid fields.
</t>

</section>

<section title="The message/global Media Type" anchor="utf8smtp">

<t>
Internationalized messages in this format MUST only be transmitted as
authorized by <xref target="RFC6531" />
or within a non-SMTP environment that supports these messages.  
A message is a "message/global message" if:
</t>

<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>it contains 8-bit UTF-8 header values as specified in this document, or</t>
<t>it contains 8-bit UTF-8 values in the header fields of body parts.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
The content of a message/global part is otherwise identical to that
of a message/rfc822 part.
</t>

<t>
If an object of this type is sent to a 7-bit-only system, it MUST
have an appropriate content-transfer-encoding applied.  
(Note that a system compliant with MIME that doesn't recognize
message/global is supposed to treat it as "application/octet-stream" as
described in Section 5.2.4 of <xref target="RFC2046" />.)
</t>

<t>
The registration is as follows:

<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Type name:">message</t>
<t hangText="Subtype name:">global</t>
<t hangText="Required parameters:">none</t>
<t hangText="Optional parameters:">none</t>

<t hangText="Security considerations:">See <xref target="security" />.</t>
<t hangText="Interoperability considerations:">This media type provides 
functionality similar to the message/rfc822 content type for email 
messages with internationalized email headers.  When there is a need to 
embed or return such content in another message, there is generally an 
option to use this media type and leave the content unchanged or 
down-convert the content to message/rfc822.  Each of these choices will 
interoperate with the installed base, but with different properties.  
Systems unaware of internationalized headers will typically treat a 
message/global body part as an unknown attachment, while they will 
understand the structure of a message/rfc822.  However, systems that
understand message/global will provide functionality superior to the 
result of a down-conversion to message/rfc822.  The most interoperable 
choice depends on the deployed software.</t>

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">

<t>
Because UTF-8 often requires several octets to encode a single character, 
internationalization may cause header field values (in general) and mail addresses
(in particular) to become longer. As specified in <xref target="RFC5322"/>, each
line of  characters MUST be no more than 998 octets, excluding the CRLF. On the
other  hand, MDA (Mail Delivery Agent) processes that parse, store, or handle
email  addresses or local parts must take extra care not to overflow buffers, 
truncate addresses, or exceed storage allotments. Also, they must take care, 
when comparing, to use the entire lengths of the addresses.
</t>

<t>
There are lots of ways to use UTF-8 to represent something equivalent 
or similar to a particular displayed character or group of characters;
see the security considerations in <xref target="RFC3629"/> for details 
on the problems this can cause. The normalization process described in
<xref target="Normalization" /> is recommended to minimize these issues.
</t>

<t>
The security impact of UTF-8 headers on email signature systems such as 
Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM), S/MIME, and OpenPGP is discussed in 
Section 14 of <xref target="RFC6530"/>.  
</t>

<t>
If a user has a non-ASCII mailbox address and an ASCII mailbox
address, a digital certificate that identifies that user might have
both addresses in the identity. Having multiple email addresses as
identities in a single certificate is already supported in
PKIX (Public Key Infrastructure using X.509) <xref target="RFC5280" /> 
and OpenPGP <xref target="RFC3156" />, but there may be user-interface issues
associated with the introduction of UTF-8 into addresses in this context.
</t>

<t>
IANA has updated the registration of the message/global MIME type
using the registration form contained in <xref target="utf8smtp" />.
