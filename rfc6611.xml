		<t>
			Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping can be categorized into two primary scenarios: the split scenario and the integrated 
			scenario. In the split scenario, the mobile node's mobility service is authorized by a different service authorizer 
			than the network access authorizer. In the integrated scenario, the mobile node's mobility service is 
			authorized by the same service authorizer as the network access service authorizer. This document defines a 
			method for home agent information discovery for the integrated scenario.
		</t>

	<section title="Introduction and Scope">
		<t>
			The Mobile IPv6 protocol <xref target="RFC6275" /> requires the mobile node to have the following information: 
			<list style="symbols">
                         <t>the Home Address (HoA),</t> 
                         <t>the home agent address, and</t> 
                         <t>the cryptographic materials for establishing an IPsec security 
			association with the home agent.</t> </list></t>
<t>The cryptographic materials need to be established prior to initiating the registration process. The mechanism via which
			the mobile node obtains this information is called "Mobile IPv6 
			bootstrapping". In order to allow a flexible deployment model for Mobile IPv6, it is desirable to define 
			a bootstrapping mechanism for the mobile node to acquire these parameters dynamically. <xref target="RFC4640" /> 
			describes the problem statement for Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping. It also defines the bootstrapping
			scenarios based on the relationship between the entity that authenticates and authorizes the mobile 
			node for network access (i.e., the Access Service Authorizer, ASA) and the entity that authenticates and authorizes 
			the mobile node for mobility service (i.e., the Mobility Service Authorizer, MSA). The scenario in which the 
			Access Service Authorizer is not the Mobility Service Authorizer is called the "split" scenario. The bootstrapping
			solution for the split scenario is defined in <xref target="RFC5026" />. The scenario in which the 
			Access Service Authorizer is also the Mobility Service Authorizer is called the "integrated" scenario. 
			This document defines a bootstrapping solution for the integrated scenario. 
   		</t>
   		<t>
   			<xref target="RFC5026" /> identifies four different components of the bootstrapping problem: home agent 
   			address discovery, HoA assignment, IPsec Security Association <xref target="RFC4301" /> setup, and Authentication and Authorization 
   			with the MSA. This document defines a mechanism for home agent address discovery. The other components of 
   			bootstrapping are as per <xref target="RFC5026" />.       	
	    </t>
	    <t>
	    	In the integrated scenario, the bootstrapping of the home agent information can be achieved via DHCPv6. 
	    	This document defines the MIPv6 bootstrapping procedures for the integrated scenario. It enables home 
	    	agent assignment in the integrated scenario by utilizing DHCP and Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) protocols. The specification utilizes DHCP 
	    	and AAA options and attribute-value pairs (AVPs) that are defined in <xref target="RFC6610" /> and <xref target="RFC5447" />. This document specifies the interworking among Mobile Node (MN), Network Access Server (NAS), DHCP, and AAA entities for 
	    	the bootstrapping procedure in the integrated scenario.
	    </t>

	<section title="Terminology">
	
	    <t>
			The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", 
			"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
			<xref target="RFC2119" />.
    	</t>
	
		<t> 
			General mobility terminology can be found in <xref target="RFC3753" />. The following additional 
			terms, as defined in <xref target="RFC4640" />, are used in this document: 
		</t>
		<t>
			Access Service Authorizer (ASA):		
			
					A network operator that authenticates a mobile node and establishes the mobile 
					node's authorization to receive Internet service. 
        </t>
        <t>
			Access Service Provider (ASP):
			
					A network operator that provides direct IP packet forwarding to and from 
					the mobile node.
        </t> 
        <t>
			Mobility Service Authorizer (MSA):
			
					A service provider that authorizes Mobile IPv6 service. 
		</t>
		<t>
			Mobility Service Provider (MSP):		
			
						A service provider that provides Mobile IPv6 service. An MSP is called a "home 
						MSP" when MSP == MSA. In this document, the term MSP means a Mobility 
						Service Provider that has a roaming relationship with the MSA but it is not the MSA.
		</t>
		<t>
			Split 
			Scenario:	A scenario where the mobility service and the network access service are 
            			authorized by different entities. 
		</t>
		<t>
			Integrated 
			Scenario: 	A scenario where the mobility service and the network access service are 
            			authorized by the same entity.
        </t>
    
    </section>
    
    <section title="Assumptions and Conformance">
    	<t>
    		The following assumptions are made in this document:
    	</t><list style="format (%c)">
    		<t>MSA == ASA.</t>
			<t>MSA and MSP have a roaming relationship.</t>
			<t>DHCP relay and NAS are either co-located or there is a mechanism to transfer received AAA information 
			from the NAS to the DHCP relay. </t><list style="empty">
			<t>
				Note: If assignment of a home agent in the home MSP is not required by a deployment, co-location of 
				the NAS and the DHCP relay functions or a mechanism to transfer received AAA information from the 
				NAS to the DHCP relay won't be necessary. In such a case, only the implementation of the options and 
				procedures defined in <xref target="RFC6610" /> should suffice.
			</t></list>

			<t>The NAS shall support MIPv6-specific AAA attributes as specified in <xref target="RFC5447" />.</t>
			<t>The AAA server in the home domain (AAAH) used for network access authentication (ASA) has access to the same database as the 
			AAAH used for the mobility service authentication (MSA). </t></list>

		
		<t>
			If home agent assignment is required only in the ASP by the deployment, a minimal implementation  
			of this specification MAY only support the delivery of information from the DHCP server to 
			the DHCP client through <xref target="RFC6610" />. However, if home agent assignment in the
   MSP is required by the deployment, an implementation conforming to
   this specification SHALL be able to transfer the information
   received from the AAA server to the NAS, and from the NAS to the DHCP relay function. This can 
			be achieved either by co-locating the NAS and the DHCP relay functions or via an interface between 
			these functions. The details of this interface are out of the scope of this specification.

		<section title="Logical View of the Integrated Scenario">
			<t>
   				In the integrated scenario, the mobile node utilizes the network access authentication process 
   				to bootstrap Mobile IPv6. It is assumed that the access service authorizer is mobility 
   				service aware.  This allows for Mobile IPv6	bootstrapping at the time of access authentication
   				and authorization. Also, the mechanism defined in this document requires the NAS to support 
   				MIP6-specific AAA attributes and a co-located DHCP relay agent.

				In this case, the mobile node is able to acquire the home agent address via a DHCPv6 query.
				In
				the integrated scenario, the ASA and the MSA are the same; it can be safely assumed that the AAAH 
				used for network access authentication (ASA) has access to the same database as the AAAH used for
				the mobility service authentication (MSA). Hence, the same AAAH can authorize the mobile node for 
				network access and mobility service at the same time. When the MN performs Mobile IPv6 registration,

        and includes it in the Visited Home Network Information Option <xref target="RFC6610" /> in the Reply Message.  Note that in this case, the DHCP server
        does not use the received information in the Relay-Supplied Options
        option.
				</t>
				<t>
					The relay agent relays the Reply Message from the DHCP server to
        the mobile node.  At this point, the mobile node has the home
        agent information that it requested.
				</t></list>

		<section title="Bootstrapping Message Sequence: Fallback Case">
		
			<t>
			
     			In the fallback case, the mobile node is not able to acquire the home agent information via DHCPv6. 
				The mobile node MAY perform DNS queries to discover the home agent address as defined in 
				<xref target="RFC5026" />. To perform DNS-based home agent discovery, the mobile node needs to know 
				the DNS server address. The details of how the MN is configured with the DNS server address are 
				outside the scope of this document.

		<section title="HoA and IKEv2 SA Bootstrapping in the Integrated Scenario">
			<t>
				In the integrated scenario, the HoA, IPsec Security Association setup, and Authentication 
				and Authorization with the MSA are bootstrapped via the same mechanism as described in the 
				bootstrapping solution for the split scenario <xref target="RFC5026" />.

    <section title="Security Considerations">

   		<t>
   			The transport of the assigned home agent information via the AAA infrastructure (i.e., from the 
   			AAA server to the AAA client) to the NAS may only be integrity protected as per standard 
   			Diameter or other AAA protocol security mechanisms. No additional security considerations are imposed by 
   			the usage of this document.  The security mechanisms provided by  
   			<xref target="RFC3588" /> are applicable for this purpose. This document does not introduce 
   			any new security issues to Mobile IPv6.
