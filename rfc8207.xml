  <abstract>

    <t>Deployment of the BGPsec architecture and protocols has many
     operational considerations.  This document attempts to collect and
     present the most critical and universal.  Operational practices are expected to evolve as BGPsec is formalized and initially deployed.</t>

  <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

    <t>Origin validation based on the Resource Public Key Infrastructure
    (RPKI) <xref target="RFC6811"/> is in its early phases.  As
    BGPsec <xref target="RFC8205"/> may require
    larger memory and/or more modern CPUs, it expected to be deployed
    incrementally over a longer time span.  BGPsec is a new protocol
    with many operational considerations that this document attempts to
    describe.  As with most operational practices, they will likely change over time.</t>

    <t>BGPsec relies on widespread propagation of the RPKI <xref
    target="RFC6480"/>.  How the RPKI is distributed and maintained
    globally and within an operator's infrastructure may be different
    for BGPsec than for origin validation.</t>

    <t>BGPsec needs to be spoken only by an Autonomous System's (AS's) eBGP-speaking border
    routers.  It is designed so that it can be used to protect
    announcements that are originated by resource-constrained edge
    routers.  This has special operational considerations, see <xref
    target="edge-site"/>.</t>

    <t>Different prefixes may have different timing and replay
      protection considerations.</t>

    <t>It is assumed that the reader understands BGP <xref target="RFC4271"/>,
    BGPsec <xref target="RFC8205"/>, the RPKI <xref target="RFC6480"/>, the RPKI Repository Structure
      <xref target="RFC6481"/>, and Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs)
      <xref target="RFC6482"/>.</t>

  <section anchor="rpki" title="RPKI Distribution and Maintenance">

    <t>The considerations for RPKI objects (Certificates, Certificate
    Revocation Lists (CRLs), manifests <xref target="RFC6481"/>, and Ghostbusters Records <xref target="RFC6493"/>),
    Trust Anchor Locators (TALs) <xref target="RFC7730"/>, cache
    behaviors of synchronization, and validation from the section on
    RPKI Distribution and Maintenance of <xref target="RFC7115"/> apply.
    Specific considerations relating to ROA objects do not apply to this
    document.</t>

    </section>

  <section anchor="router-certs" title="AS/Router Certificates">

    <t>As described in <xref target="KEY"/>,
    BGPsec-speaking routers are capable of generating their own
    public/private key-pairs and having their certificates signed and
    published in the RPKI by the RPKI Certification Authority (CA) system, and/or are given
    public/private key-pairs by the operator.</t>

    <t>A site/operator may use a single certificate/key in all their
      routers, one certificate/key per router, or any granularity in
      between.</t>

    <t>A large operator, concerned that a compromise of one router's key
      would make other routers vulnerable, may deploy a more complex
      certificate/key distribution burden to reduce this exposure.</t>

    <t>At the other end of the spectrum, an edge site with one or two
      routers may choose to use a single certificate/key.</t>

    <t>In anticipation of possible key compromise, a prudent operator
    SHOULD pre-provision each router's 'next' key in the RPKI so that there
    is no propagation delay for provisioning the new key.</t>

    </section>

  <section anchor="topology" title="Within a Network">


    <t>BGPsec is spoken by edge routers in a network, specifically those that border
      other networks/ASes.</t>

    <t>In an AS where edge routers speak BGPsec and, therefore, inject
    BGPsec paths into the iBGP (internal BGP), Route Reflectors (RRs) MUST have BGPsec
    enabled if and only if there are eBGP (external BGP) speakers in their client cone,
    i.e., an RR client or the transitive closure of a client's
    customers.</t>

    <t>A BGPsec-capable router MAY use the data it receives to influence
      local policy within its network, see <xref target="policy"/>.  In
      deployment, this policy should fit into the AS's existing policy,
      preferences, etc.  This allows a network to incrementally deploy
      BGPsec-enabled border routers.</t>

    <t>eBGP speakers that face more critical peers or upstreams or downstreams
      would be candidates for early deployment.  Both securing one's own
      announcements and validating received announcements should be
      considered in partial deployment.</t>

    <t>An operator should be aware that BGPsec, as any other policy
      change, can cause traffic shifts in their network.  And, as with
      normal policy shift practice, a prudent operator has the tools and
      methods to predict, measure, modify, etc.</t>

    <t>On the other hand, an operator wanting to monitor router loading,
      shifts in traffic, etc., might deploy incrementally while watching
      those and similar effects.</t>

    <t>BGPsec does not sign over communities, so they are not formally
      trustable.  Additionally, outsourcing verification is not a prudent
      security practice.  Therefore, an eBGP listener SHOULD NOT strongly
      trust unsigned security signaling, such as communities, received
      across a trust boundary.</t>

    </section>

  <section anchor="edge-site" title="Considerations for Edge Sites">

    <t>An edge site that does not provide transit and trusts its
      upstream(s) may only originate a signed prefix announcement and
      not validate received announcements.</t>

    <t>An operator might need to use hardware with limited resources.  In
      such cases, BGPsec protocol capability negotiation allows for a
      resource-constrained edge router to hold only its own signing
      key(s) and sign its announcements, but not receive signed
      announcements.  Therefore, the router would not have to deal with
      the majority of the RPKI, potentially saving the need for
      additional hardware.</t>

    <t>As the vast majority of ASes are stubs, and they announce the
    majority of prefixes, this allows for simpler and less expensive
    incremental deployment.  It may also mean that edge sites concerned
    with routing security will be attracted to upstreams that support
    BGPsec.</t>

    </section>

  <section anchor="policy" title="Routing Policy">

    <t>As BGPsec-signed paths cannot traverse non-BGPsec topology,
    partial BGPsec deployment forms islands of assured paths.  As
    islands grow to touch each other, they become larger islands.</t>
    
    <t>Unlike origin validation based on the RPKI, BGPsec marks a
      received announcement as Valid or Not Valid, there is no explicit
      NotFound state.  In some sense, an unsigned BGP4 path is the
      equivalent of NotFound.  How this is used in routing is up to the
      operator's local policy, similar to origin validation as in
      <xref target="RFC6811"/>.</t>

    <t>As BGPsec will be rolled out over years and does not allow for
      intermediate non-signing edge routers, coverage will be spotty for
      a long time.  This presents a dilemma; should a router evaluating
      an inbound BGPsec_PATH as Not Valid be very strict and discard it?
      On the other hand, it might be the only path to that prefix, and a
      very low local-preference would cause it to be used and propagated
      only if there was no alternative.  Either choice is reasonable,
      but we recommend dropping because of the next point.</t>

    <t>Operators should be aware that accepting Not Valid announcements,
      no matter the local preference, will often be the equivalent of
      treating them as fully Valid.  Local preference affects only
      routes to the same set of destinations.  Consider having a Valid
      announcement from neighbor V for prefix 10.0.0.0/16 and a Not
      Valid announcement for 10.0.666.0/24 from neighbor I.  If local
      policy on the router is not configured to discard the Not Valid
      announcement from I, then the longest match forwarding will send
      packets to neighbor I no matter the value of local preference.</t>

    <t>Validation of signed paths is usually deployed at the eBGP
      edge.</t>

    <t>Local policy on the eBGP edge MAY convey the validation state of
    a BGP-signed path through normal local policy mechanisms, e.g.,
    setting a BGP community for internal use, or modifying a metric
    value such as local-preference or Multi-Exit Discriminator (MED).
    Some may choose to use the large Local-Pref hammer.  Others may
    choose to let AS path rule and set their internal metric, which
    comes after AS path in the BGP decision process.</t>

    <t>As the mildly stochastic timing of RPKI propagation may cause
    version skew across routers, an AS Path that does not validate at
    router R0 might validate at R1.  Therefore, signed paths that are
    Not Valid and yet propagated (because they are chosen as best path)
    MUST NOT have signatures stripped and MUST be signed if sent to
    external BGPsec speakers.</t>

    <t>This implies that updates which a speaker judges to be Not Valid
      MAY be propagated to iBGP peers.  Therefore, unless local policy
      ensures otherwise, a signed path learned via iBGP may be Not Valid.
      If needed, the validation state should be signaled by normal local
      policy mechanisms such as communities or metrics.</t>

    <t>On the other hand, local policy on the eBGP edge might preclude
      iBGP or eBGP announcement of signed AS Paths that are Not Valid.</t>

    <t>A BGPsec speaker receiving a path SHOULD perform origin
      validation per <xref target="RFC6811"/> and
      <xref target="RFC7115"/>.</t>

    <t>A route server is usually 'transparent', i.e., does not insert an AS
      into the path so as not to increase the AS hop count, and thereby
      affect downstream path choices.  But, with BGPsec, a client router
      R needs to be able to validate paths that are forward signed to
      R.  But the sending router cannot generate signatures to all the
      possible clients.  Therefore, a BGPsec-aware route server needs to
      validate the incoming BGPsec_PATH and to forward updates that
      can be validated by clients that must, therefore, know the route
      server's AS.  This implies that the route server creates
      signatures per client including its own AS in the BGPsec_PATH,
      forward signing to each client AS, see <xref
      target="RFC8205"/>.  The route server uses a pCount of 0 to not increase the effective AS hop count, thereby
      retaining the intent of 'transparency'.</t>

    <t>If it is known that a BGPsec neighbor is a transparent route
      server, or otherwise may validly use a pCount of 0 (e.g., see <xref
      target="RFC8206"/>), the router SHOULD be configured to accept and
      process a received pCount of 0. Routers MUST disallow a pCount of 0 by default.</t>

    <t>To prevent exposure of the internals of the BGP confederations <xref
      target="RFC5065"/>, a BGPsec speaker exporting to a non-member
      removes all intra-confederation Secure_Path Segments.  Therefore,
      signing within the confederation will not cause external confusion
      even if non-unique private ASes are used.</t>

    </section>

  <section anchor="notes" title="Notes">

    <t>For protection from attacks replaying BGP data on the order of a
      day or longer old, rekeying routers with new keys (previously)
      provisioned in the RPKI is sufficient.  For one approach, see
      <xref target="ROLLOVER"/>.</t>

    <t>A router that once negotiated (and/or sent) BGPsec should not be
    expected to always do so.</t>

    <t>Like the DNS, the Global RPKI presents only a loosely consistent
      view, depending on timing, updating, fetching, etc.  Thus, one
      cache or router may have different data about a particular prefix
      or router than another cache or router.  There is no 'fix' for
      this, it is the nature of distributed data with distributed
      caches.</t>

    <t>Operators who manage certificates SHOULD have RPKI Ghostbuster
      Records (see <xref target="RFC6493"/>), signed
      indirectly by end entity certificates, for those certificates on
      which others' routing depends for certificate and/or ROA
      validation.</t>

    <t>Operators should be aware of impending algorithm transitions,
      which will be rare and slow-paced, see <xref target="RFC6916"/>.
      They should work with their vendors to ensure support for new
      algorithms.</t>

    <t>As a router must evaluate certificates and ROAs that are time
      dependent, routers' clocks MUST be correct to a tolerance of
      approximately an hour.  The common approach is for operators to
      deploy servers that provide time service, such as <xref
      target="RFC5905"/>, to client routers.</t>

    <t>If a router has reason to believe its clock is seriously
      incorrect, e.g., it has a time earlier than 2011, it SHOULD NOT
      attempt to validate incoming updates.  It SHOULD defer validation
      until it believes it is within reasonable time tolerance.</t>
