    <abstract>
      <t>Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of network in which
      both the routers and their interconnect are constrained. LLN routers
      typically operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and
      energy (battery power). Their interconnects are characterized by high
      loss rates, low data rates, and instability. LLNs are comprised of
      anything from a few dozen to thousands of routers. Supported
      traffic flows include point-to-point (between devices inside the LLN),
      point-to-multipoint (from a central control point to a subset of devices
      inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from devices inside the LLN
      towards a central control point). This document specifies the IPv6
      Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), which provides a mechanism whereby
      multipoint-to-point traffic from devices inside the LLN towards a
      central control point as well as point-to-multipoint traffic from the
      central control point to the devices inside the LLN are supported.
      Support for point-to-point traffic is also available.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) consist largely of constrained
      nodes (with limited processing power, memory, and sometimes energy when
      they are battery operated or energy scavenging). These routers are
      interconnected by lossy links, typically supporting only low data rates,
      that are usually unstable with relatively low packet delivery rates.
      Another characteristic of such networks is that the traffic patterns are
      not simply point-to-point, but in many cases point-to-multipoint or
      multipoint-to-point. Furthermore, such networks may potentially comprise
      up to thousands of nodes. These characteristics offer unique challenges
      to a routing solution: the IETF ROLL working group has defined
      application-specific routing requirements for a Low-power and Lossy
      Network (LLN) routing protocol, specified in <xref
      target="RFC5867"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5826"></xref>, <xref
      target="RFC5673"></xref>, and <xref target="RFC5548"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document specifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL). Note that although RPL was specified according to
      the requirements set forth in the aforementioned requirement documents,
      its use is in no way limited to these applications.</t>

      <section title="Design Principles">
        <t>RPL was designed with the objective to meet the requirements
        spelled out in <xref target="RFC5867"></xref>, <xref
        target="RFC5826"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5673"></xref>, and <xref
        target="RFC5548"></xref>.</t>

        <t>A network may run multiple instances of RPL concurrently. Each such
        instance may serve different and potentially antagonistic constraints
        or performance criteria. This document defines how a single instance
        operates.</t>

        <t>In order to be useful in a wide range of LLN application domains,
        RPL separates packet processing and forwarding from the routing
        optimization objective. Examples of such objectives include minimizing
        energy, minimizing latency, or satisfying constraints. This document
        describes the mode of operation of RPL. Other companion documents
        specify routing Objective Functions. A RPL implementation, in support
        of a particular LLN application, will include the necessary Objective
        Function(s) as required by the application.</t>

        <t>RPL operations require bidirectional links. In some LLN scenarios,
        those links may exhibit asymmetric properties. It is required that the
        reachability of a router be verified before the router can be used as
        a parent. RPL expects an external mechanism to be triggered during the
        parent selection phase in order to verify link properties and neighbor
        reachability. Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD) is such a
        mechanism, but alternates are possible, including Bidirectional
        Forwarding Detection (BFD) <xref target="RFC5881"></xref> and hints from
        lower layers via Layer 2 (L2) triggers like <xref target="RFC5184"></xref>. In a
        general fashion, a detection mechanism that is reactive to traffic is
        favored in order to minimize the cost of monitoring links that are not
        being used.</t>

        <t>RPL also expects an external mechanism to access and transport some
        control information, referred to as the "RPL Packet Information", in
        data packets. The RPL Packet Information is defined in <xref
        target="loopdetect"></xref> and enables the association of a data
        packet with a RPL Instance and the validation of RPL routing states.
        The RPL option <xref
        target="RFC6553"></xref> is an example of such
        mechanism. The mechanism is required for all packets except when
        strict source routing is used (that is for packets going Downward in
        Non-Storing mode as detailed further in <xref
        target="DownwardRoutes"></xref>), which by nature prevents endless
        loops and alleviates the need for the RPL Packet Information. Future
        companion specifications may propose alternate ways to carry the RPL
        Packet Information in the IPv6 packets and may extend the RPL Packet
        Information to support additional features.</t>

        <t>RPL provides a mechanism to disseminate information over the
        dynamically formed network topology. This dissemination enables minimal
        configuration in the nodes, allowing nodes to operate mostly
        autonomously. This mechanism uses <xref
        target="RFC6206">Trickle</xref> to optimize the
        dissemination as described in <xref
        target="DIOTransmission"></xref>.</t>

        <t>In some applications, RPL assembles topologies of routers that own
        independent prefixes. Those prefixes may or may not be aggregatable
        depending on the origin of the routers. A prefix that is owned by a
        router is advertised as on-link.</t>

        <t>RPL also introduces the capability to bind a subnet together with a
        common prefix and to route within that subnet. A source can inject
        information about the subnet to be disseminated by RPL, and that
        source is authoritative for that subnet. Because many LLN links have
        non-transitive properties, a common prefix that RPL disseminates over
        the subnet must not be advertised as on-link.</t>

        <t>In particular, RPL may disseminate IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)
        information such as the <xref target="RFC4861"></xref> Prefix
        Information Option (PIO) and the <xref target="RFC4191"></xref> Route
        Information Option (RIO). ND information that is disseminated by RPL
        conserves all its original semantics for router to host, with limited
        extensions for router to router, though it is not to be confused with
        routing advertisements and it is never to be directly redistributed in
        another routing protocol. A RPL node often combines host and router
        behaviors. As a host, it will process the options as specified in
        <xref target="RFC4191"></xref>, <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>, <xref
        target="RFC4862"></xref>, and <xref target="RFC6275"></xref>. As a
        router, the RPL node may advertise the information from the options as
        required for the specific link, for instance, in an ND Router Advertisement (RA) message,
        though the exact operation is out of scope.</t>

        <t>A set of companion documents to this specification will provide
        further guidance in the form of applicability statements specifying a
        set of operating points appropriate to the Building Automation, Home
        Automation, Industrial, and Urban application scenarios.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Expectations of Link-Layer Type">
        <t>In compliance with the layered architecture of IP, RPL does not
        rely on any particular features of a specific link-layer technology.
        RPL is designed to be able to operate over a variety of different link
        layers, including ones that are constrained, potentially lossy, or
        typically utilized in conjunction with highly constrained host or
        router devices, such as but not limited to, low-power wireless or PLC
        (Power Line Communication) technologies.</t>

        <t>Implementers may find <xref target="RFC3819"></xref> a useful
        reference when designing a link-layer interface between RPL and a
        particular link-layer technology.</t>

    <section anchor="Terminology" title="Terminology">

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

      <t>Additionally, this document uses terminology from <xref
      target="ROLL-TERMS"></xref>, and introduces the following
      terminology: <list hangIndent="15" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="DAG:">Directed Acyclic Graph. A directed graph having
          the property that all edges are oriented in such a way that no
          cycles exist. All edges are contained in paths oriented toward and
          terminating at one or more root nodes.</t>

          <t hangText="DAG root:">A DAG root is a node within the DAG that has
          no outgoing edge. Because the graph is acyclic, by definition, all
          DAGs must have at least one DAG root and all paths terminate at a
          DAG root.</t>

          <t hangText="Destination-Oriented DAG (DODAG):">
<vspace />
A DAG rooted at a
          single destination, i.e., at a single DAG root (the DODAG root) with
          no outgoing edges.</t>

          <t hangText="DODAG root:">A DODAG root is the DAG root of a DODAG.
          The DODAG root may act as a border router for the DODAG; in
          particular, it may aggregate routes in the DODAG and may
          redistribute DODAG routes into other routing protocols.</t>

          <t hangText="Virtual DODAG root:"><vspace />A Virtual DODAG root is the result
          of two or more RPL routers, for instance, 6LoWPAN Border Routers
          (6LBRs), coordinating to synchronize DODAG state and act in concert
          as if they are a single DODAG root (with multiple interfaces), with
          respect to the LLN. The coordination most likely occurs between
          powered devices over a reliable transit link, and the details of
          that scheme are out of scope for this specification (to be defined
          in future companion specifications).</t>

          <t hangText="Up:">Up refers to the direction from leaf nodes towards
          DODAG roots, following DODAG edges. This follows the common
          terminology used in graphs and depth-first-search, where vertices
          further from the root are "deeper" or "down" and vertices closer
          to the root are "shallower" or "up".</t>

          <t hangText="Down:">Down refers to the direction from DODAG roots
          towards leaf nodes, in the reverse direction of DODAG edges. This
          follows the common terminology used in graphs and
          depth-first-search, where vertices further from the root are
          "deeper" or "down" and vertices closer to the root are
          "shallower" or "up".</t>

          <t hangText="Rank:">A node's Rank defines the node's individual
          position relative to other nodes with respect to a DODAG root. Rank
          strictly increases in the Down direction and strictly decreases in
          the Up direction. The exact way Rank is computed depends on the
          DAG's Objective Function (OF). The Rank may analogously track a
          simple topological distance, may be calculated as a function of link
          metrics, and may consider other properties such as constraints.</t>

          <t hangText="Objective Function (OF):"><vspace />An OF defines how routing metrics,
          optimization objectives, and related functions are used to compute
          Rank. Furthermore, the OF dictates how parents in the DODAG are
          selected and, thus, the DODAG formation.</t>

          <t hangText="Objective Code Point (OCP):"><vspace />An OCP is an identifier that
          indicates which Objective Function the DODAG uses.</t>

          <t hangText="RPLInstanceID:">A RPLInstanceID is a unique identifier within a network.
          DODAGs with the same RPLInstanceID share the same Objective
          Function.</t>

          <t hangText="RPL Instance:">A RPL Instance is a set of one or more DODAGs that share a
          RPLInstanceID. At most, a RPL node can belong to one DODAG in a RPL
          Instance. Each RPL Instance operates independently of other RPL
          Instances. This document describes operation within a single RPL
          Instance.</t>

          <t hangText="DODAGID:">A DODAGID is the identifier of a DODAG root. The DODAGID
          is unique within the scope of a RPL Instance in the LLN. The tuple
          (RPLInstanceID, DODAGID) uniquely identifies a DODAG.</t>

          <t hangText="DODAG Version:">A DODAG Version is a specific iteration ("Version") of a
          DODAG with a given DODAGID.</t>

          <t hangText="DODAGVersionNumber:">A DODAGVersionNumber is a sequential counter that is
          incremented by the root to form a new Version of a DODAG. A DODAG
          Version is identified uniquely by the (RPLInstanceID, DODAGID,
          DODAGVersionNumber) tuple.</t>

          <t hangText="Goal:">The Goal is an application-specific goal that is
          defined outside the scope of RPL. Any node that roots a DODAG will
          need to know about this Goal to decide whether or not the Goal can be satisfied. A typical Goal is to construct the DODAG according to a
          specific Objective Function and to keep connectivity to a set of
          hosts (e.g., to use an Objective Function that minimizes a metric and
          is connected to a specific database host to store the collected
          data).</t>

          <t hangText="Grounded:">A DODAG is grounded when the DODAG root can
          satisfy the Goal.</t>

          <t hangText="Floating:">A DODAG is floating if it is not grounded. A
          floating DODAG is not expected to have the properties required to
          satisfy the goal. It may, however, provide connectivity to other
          nodes within the DODAG.</t>

          <t hangText="DODAG parent:">A parent of a node within a DODAG is one
          of the immediate successors of the node on a path towards the DODAG
          root. A DODAG parent's Rank is lower than the node's. (See <xref
          target="RankComparison"></xref>).</t>

          <t hangText="Sub-DODAG:">The sub-DODAG of a node is the set of other
          nodes whose paths to the DODAG root pass through that node. Nodes in
          the sub-DODAG of a node have a greater Rank than that node. (See
          <xref target="RankComparison"></xref>).</t>

          <t hangText="Local DODAG:">Local DODAGs contain one and only one
          root node, and they allow that single root node to allocate and manage a
          RPL Instance, identified by a local RPLInstanceID, without
          coordination with other nodes. Typically, this is done in order to
          optimize routes to a destination within the LLN. (See <xref
          target="RPLInstance"></xref>).</t>

          <t hangText="Global DODAG:">A Global DODAG uses a global
          RPLInstanceID that may be coordinated among several other nodes.

          topologies, for example, those imposed by point-to-point wires, so
          RPL has to discover links and then select peers sparingly.</t>

          <t>In many cases, because Layer 2 ranges overlap only partially, RPL
          forms non-transitive / Non-Broadcast Multi-Access (NBMA) network topologies upon which it computes
          routes.</t>

          <t>RPL routes are optimized for traffic to or from one or more roots
          that act as sinks for the topology. As a result, RPL organizes a
          topology as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that is partitioned into
          one or more Destination Oriented DAGs (DODAGs), one DODAG per sink.
          If the DAG has multiple roots, then it is expected that the roots
          are federated by a common backbone, such as a transit link.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="TopologyIdentifiers" title="RPL Identifiers">
          <t>RPL uses four values to identify and maintain a topology: <list
              style="symbols">
              <t>The first is a RPLInstanceID. A RPLInstanceID identifies a
              set of one or more Destination Oriented DAGs (DODAGs). A network
              may have multiple RPLInstanceIDs, each of which defines an
              independent set of DODAGs, which may be optimized for different
              Objective Functions (OFs) and/or applications. The set of DODAGs
              identified by a RPLInstanceID is called a RPL Instance. All
              DODAGs in the same RPL Instance use the same OF.</t>

              <t>The second is a DODAGID. The scope of a DODAGID is a RPL
              Instance. The combination of RPLInstanceID and DODAGID uniquely
              identifies a single DODAG in the network. A RPL Instance may
              have multiple DODAGs, each of which has an unique DODAGID.</t>

              <t>The third is a DODAGVersionNumber. The scope of a
              DODAGVersionNumber is a DODAG. A DODAG is sometimes
              reconstructed from the DODAG root, by incrementing the
              DODAGVersionNumber. The combination of RPLInstanceID, DODAGID,
              and DODAGVersionNumber uniquely identifies a DODAG Version.</t>

              <t>The fourth is Rank. The scope of Rank is a DODAG Version.
              Rank establishes a partial order over a DODAG Version, defining
              individual node positions with respect to the DODAG root.</t>
            </list></t>
        </section>

        <section title="Instances, DODAGs, and DODAG Versions">
          <t>A RPL Instance contains one or more DODAG roots. A RPL Instance
          may provide routes to certain destination prefixes, reachable via
          the DODAG roots or alternate paths within the DODAG. These roots may
          operate independently, or they may coordinate over a network that is not
          necessarily as constrained as an LLN.</t>

          <t>A RPL Instance may comprise:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>a single DODAG with a single root <list>
                  <t>For example, a DODAG optimized to minimize latency rooted
                  at a single centralized lighting controller in a Home
                  Automation application.</t>
                </list></t>

              <t>multiple uncoordinated DODAGs with independent roots
              (differing DODAGIDs) <list>
                  <t>For example, multiple data collection points in an urban
                  data collection application that do not have suitable
                  connectivity to coordinate with each other or that use the
                  formation of multiple DODAGs as a means to dynamically and
                  autonomously partition the network.</t>
                </list></t>

              <t>a single DODAG with a virtual root that coordinates LLN sinks
              (with the same DODAGID) over a backbone network.<list>
                  <t>For example, multiple border routers operating with a
                  reliable transit link, e.g., in support of an IPv6 Low-Power Wireless
   Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN)
                  application, that are capable of acting as logically equivalent
                  interfaces to the sink of the same DODAG.</t>
                </list></t>

              <t>a combination of the above as suited to some application
              scenario.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Each RPL packet is associated with a particular RPLInstanceID
          (see <xref target="loopdetect"></xref>) and, therefore, RPL Instance
          (<xref target="RPLInstance"></xref>). The provisioning or automated
          discovery of a mapping between a RPLInstanceID and a type or service
          of application traffic is out of scope for this specification (to be
          defined in future companion specifications).</t>

          <t><xref target="figInstance"></xref> depicts an example of a RPL
          Instance comprising three DODAGs with DODAG roots R1, R2, and R3.
          Each of these DODAG roots advertises the same RPLInstanceID. The
          lines depict connectivity between parents and children.</t>

          <t><xref target="figDODAGVersion"></xref> depicts how a DODAGVersionNumber increment leads to a new DODAG Version. This
          depiction illustrates a DODAGVersionNumber increment that results
          in a different DODAG topology. Note that a new DODAG Version does
          not always imply a different DODAG topology. To accommodate certain
          topology changes requires a new DODAG Version, as described later in
          this specification.</t>

          <t>In the following examples, please note that tree-like structures
          are depicted for simplicity, although the DODAG structure allows for
          each node to have multiple parents when the connectivity supports
          it.</t>

      <section title="Upward Routes and DODAG Construction">
        <t>RPL provisions routes Up towards DODAG roots, forming a DODAG
        optimized according to an Objective Function (OF). RPL nodes construct
        and maintain these DODAGs through DODAG Information Object (DIO)
        messages.</t>

        <section title="Objective Function (OF)">
          <t>The Objective Function (OF) defines how RPL nodes select and
          optimize routes within a RPL Instance. The OF is identified by an
          Objective Code Point (OCP) within the DIO Configuration option. An
          OF defines how nodes translate one or more metrics and constraints,
          which are themselves defined in <xref
          target="RFC6551"></xref>, into a value called
          Rank, which approximates the node's distance from a DODAG root. An
          OF also defines how nodes select parents. Further details may be
          found in <xref target="OFGuide"></xref>, <xref
          target="RFC6551"></xref>, <xref
          target="RFC6552"></xref>, and related companion
          specifications.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="DODAGRepair" title="DODAG Repair">
          <t>A DODAG root institutes a global repair operation by incrementing
          the DODAGVersionNumber. This initiates a new DODAG Version. Nodes
          in the new DODAG Version can choose a new position whose Rank is not
          constrained by their Rank within the old DODAG Version.</t>

          <t>RPL also supports mechanisms that may be used for local repair
          within the DODAG Version. The DIO message specifies the necessary
          parameters as configured from and controlled by policy at the DODAG
          root.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Security">
          <t>RPL supports message confidentiality and integrity. It is
          designed such that link-layer mechanisms can be used when available
          and appropriate; yet, in their absence, RPL can use its own
          mechanisms. RPL has three basic security modes.</t>

          <t>In the first, called "unsecured", RPL control messages are sent
          without any additional security mechanisms. Unsecured mode does not
          imply that the RPL network is unsecure: it could be using other
          present security primitives (e.g., link-layer security) to meet
          application security requirements.</t>

          <t>In the second, called "preinstalled", nodes joining a RPL
          Instance have preinstalled keys that enable them to process and
          generate secured RPL messages.</t>

          <t>The third mode is called "authenticated".  In authenticated mode,
          nodes have preinstalled keys as in preinstalled mode, but the
          preinstalled key may only be used to join a RPL Instance as a leaf.
          Joining an authenticated RPL Instance as a router requires obtaining
          a key from an authentication authority. The process by which this
          key is obtained is out of scope for this specification. Note that
          this specification alone does not provide sufficient detail for a
          RPL implementation to securely operate in authenticated mode. For a
          RPL implementation to operate securely in authenticated mode, it is
          necessary for a future companion specification to detail the
          mechanisms by which a node obtains/requests the authentication
          material (e.g., key, certificate) and to determine from where that
          material should be obtained. See also <xref
          target="KeyInstallation"></xref>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Grounded and Floating DODAGs">
          <t>DODAGs can be grounded or floating: the DODAG root advertises
          which is the case. A grounded DODAG offers connectivity to hosts
          that are required for satisfying the application-defined goal. A
          floating DODAG is not expected to satisfy the goal; in most cases, it
          only provides routes to nodes within the DODAG. Floating DODAGs may
          be used, for example, to preserve interconnectivity during
          repair.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Local DODAGs">
          <t>RPL nodes can optimize routes to a destination within an LLN by
          forming a Local DODAG whose DODAG root is the desired destination.
          Unlike global DAGs, which can consist of multiple DODAGs, local DAGs
          have one and only one DODAG and therefore one DODAG root. Local
          DODAGs can be constructed on demand.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Administrative Preference">
          <t>An implementation/deployment may specify that some DODAG roots
          should be used over others through an administrative preference.
          Administrative preference offers a way to control traffic and
          engineer DODAG formation in order to better support application
          requirements or needs.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Data-Path Validation and Loop Detection">
          <t>The low-power and lossy nature of LLNs motivates RPL's use of
          on-demand loop detection using data packets. Because data traffic
          can be infrequent, maintaining a routing topology that is constantly
          up to date with the physical topology can waste energy. Typical LLNs
          exhibit variations in physical connectivity that are transient and
          innocuous to traffic, but that would be costly to track closely from
          the control plane. Transient and infrequent changes in connectivity
          need not be addressed by RPL until there is data to send. This
          aspect of RPL's design draws from existing, highly used LLN
          protocols as well as extensive experimental and deployment evidence
          on its efficacy.</t>

          <t>The RPL Packet Information that is transported with data packets
          includes the Rank of the transmitter. An inconsistency between the
          routing decision for a packet (Upward or Downward) and the Rank
          relationship between the two nodes indicates a possible loop. On
          receiving such a packet, a node institutes a local repair
          operation.</t>

          <t>For example, if a node receives a packet flagged as moving in the
          Upward direction, and if that packet records that the transmitter is
          of a lower (lesser) Rank than the receiving node, then the receiving
          node is able to conclude that the packet has not progressed in the
          Upward direction and that the DODAG is inconsistent.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="daop" title="Distributed Algorithm Operation">
          <t>A high-level overview of the distributed algorithm, which
          constructs the DODAG, is as follows:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>Some nodes are configured to be DODAG roots, with associated
              DODAG configurations.</t>

              <t>Nodes advertise their presence, affiliation with a DODAG,
              routing cost, and related metrics by sending link-local
              multicast DIO messages to all-RPL-nodes.</t>

              <t>Nodes listen for DIOs and use their information to join a new
              DODAG (thus, selecting DODAG parents), or to maintain an existing
              DODAG, according to the specified Objective Function and Rank of
              their neighbors.</t>

              <t>Nodes provision routing table entries, for the destinations
              specified by the DIO message, via their DODAG parents in the
              DODAG Version. Nodes that decide to join a DODAG can provision
              one or more DODAG parents as the next hop for the default route
              and a number of other external routes for the associated
              instance.</t>
            </list></t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Downward Routes and Destination Advertisement">
        <t>RPL uses Destination Advertisement Object (DAO) messages to
        establish Downward routes. DAO messages are an optional feature for
        applications that require point-to-multipoint (P2MP) or point-to-point (P2P) traffic. RPL supports two modes
        of Downward traffic: Storing (fully stateful) or Non-Storing (fully
        source routed); see <xref target="DownwardRoutes" />. Any given RPL Instance is either storing or
        non-storing. In both cases, P2P packets travel Up toward a DODAG root
        then Down to the final destination (unless the destination is on the
        Upward route). In the Non-Storing case, the packet will travel all the
        way to a DODAG root before traveling Down. In the Storing case, the
        packet may be directed Down towards the destination by a common
        ancestor of the source and the destination prior to reaching a DODAG
        root.</t>

        <t>As of the writing of this specification, no implementation is expected to support
        both Storing and Non-Storing modes of operation. Most implementations
        are expected to support either no Downward routes, Non-Storing mode
        only, or Storing mode only. Other modes of operation, such as a hybrid
        mix of Storing and Non-Storing mode, are out of scope for this
        specification and may be described in other companion
        specifications.</t>

        <t>This specification describes a basic mode of operation in support
        of P2P traffic. Note that more optimized P2P solutions may be
        described in companion specifications.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Local DODAGs Route Discovery">
        <t>Optionally, a RPL network can support on-demand discovery of DODAGs
        to specific destinations within an LLN. Such Local DODAGs behave
        slightly differently than Global DODAGs: they are uniquely defined by
        the combination of DODAGID and RPLInstanceID. The RPLInstanceID
        denotes whether a DODAG is a Local DODAG.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="DAGRank" title="Rank Properties">
        <t>The Rank of a node is a scalar representation of the location of
        that node within a DODAG Version. The Rank is used to avoid and detect
        loops and, as such, must demonstrate certain properties. The exact
        calculation of the Rank is left to the Objective Function. Even though
        the specific computation of the Rank is left to the Objective
        Function, the Rank must implement generic properties regardless of the
        Objective Function.</t>

        <t>In particular, the Rank of the nodes must monotonically decrease as
        the DODAG Version is followed towards the DODAG destination. In that
        regard, the Rank can be considered a scalar representation of the
        location or radius of a node within a DODAG Version.</t>

        <t>The details of how the Objective Function computes Rank are out of
        scope for this specification, although that computation may depend,
        for example, on parents, link metrics, node metrics, and the node
        configuration and policies. See <xref target="OFGuide"></xref> for
        more information.</t>

        <t>The Rank is not a path cost, although its value can be derived from
        and influenced by path metrics. The Rank has properties of its own
        that are not necessarily those of all metrics: <list hangIndent="8"
            style="hanging" hangIndent="15">
            <t hangText="Type:">The Rank is an abstract numeric value.</t>

            <t hangText="Function:">The Rank is the expression of a relative
            position within a DODAG Version with regard to neighbors, and it is
            not necessarily a good indication or a proper expression of a
            distance or a path cost to the root.</t>

            <t hangText="Stability:">The stability of the Rank determines the
            stability of the routing topology. Some dampening or filtering is
            RECOMMENDED to keep the topology stable; thus, the Rank does
            not necessarily change as fast as some link or node metrics would.
            A new DODAG Version would be a good opportunity to reconcile the
            discrepancies that might form over time between metrics and Ranks
            within a DODAG Version.</t>

            <t hangText="Properties:">The Rank is incremented in a strictly
            monotonic fashion, and it can be used to validate a progression from
            or towards the root. A metric, like bandwidth or jitter, does not
            necessarily exhibit this property.</t>

            <t hangText="Abstract:">The Rank does not have a physical unit,
            but rather a range of increment per hop, where the assignment of
            each increment is to be determined by the Objective Function.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The Rank value feeds into DODAG parent selection, according to the
        RPL loop-avoidance strategy. Once a parent has been added, and a Rank
        value for the node within the DODAG has been advertised, the node's
        further options with regard to DODAG parent selection and movement
        within the DODAG are restricted in favor of loop avoidance.</t>

        <section anchor="RankComparison" title="Rank Comparison (DAGRank())">
          <t>Rank may be thought of as a fixed-point number, where the
          position of the radix point between the integer part and the
          fractional part is determined by MinHopRankIncrease.
          MinHopRankIncrease is the minimum increase in Rank between a node
          and any of its DODAG parents. A DODAG root provisions
          MinHopRankIncrease. MinHopRankIncrease creates a trade-off between
          hop cost precision and the maximum number of hops a network can
          support. A very large MinHopRankIncrease, for example, allows
          precise characterization of a given hop's effect on Rank but cannot
          support many hops.</t>

          <t>When an Objective Function computes Rank, the Objective Function
          operates on the entire (i.e., 16-bit) Rank quantity. When Rank is
          compared, e.g., for determination of parent relationships or loop
          detection, the integer portion of the Rank is to be used. The
          integer portion of the Rank is computed by the DAGRank() macro as
          follows, where floor(x) is the function that evaluates to the
          greatest integer less than or equal to x:</t>

          <figure>

           DAGRank(rank) = floor(rank/MinHopRankIncrease)            
                                                                     
]]></artwork>
          </figure>

          <t>For example, if a 16-bit Rank quantity is decimal 27, and the
          MinHopRankIncrease is decimal 16, then DAGRank(27) = floor(1.6875) =
          1. The integer part of the Rank is 1 and the fractional part is
          11/16.</t>

          <t>Following the conventions in this document, using the macro DAGRank(node) may
          be interpreted as DAGRank(node.rank), where node.rank is the Rank
          value as maintained by the node.</t>

          <t>A Node A has a Rank less than the Rank of a Node B if DAGRank(A)
          is less than DAGRank(B).</t>

          <t>A Node A has a Rank equal to the Rank of a Node B if DAGRank(A)
          is equal to DAGRank(B).</t>

          <t>Rank computations maintain the following properties for any nodes

              <t>DAGRank(M) is less than DAGRank(N):</t> <t>In this case,

              of N.&nbsp; Node M may safely be a DODAG parent for Node N without
              risk of creating a loop. Further, for a Node N, all parents in
              the DODAG parent set must be of a Rank less than DAGRank(N). In
              other words, the Rank presented by a Node N MUST be greater than
              that presented by any of its parents.</t>

              <t>DAGRank(M) equals DAGRank(N):</t><t>In this case, the
              positions of M and N within the DODAG and with respect to the
              DODAG root are similar or identical. Routing through a node with
              equal Rank may cause a routing loop (i.e., if that node chooses

          <t>As an example, the Rank could be computed in such a way so as to

          an Objective Function minimizes is ETX, or latency, or in a more
          complicated way as appropriate to the Objective Function being used
          within the DODAG.</t>

               title="Routing Metrics and Constraints Used by RPL">
        <t>Routing metrics are used by routing protocols to compute shortest
        paths. Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) such as IS-IS (<xref
        target="RFC5120"></xref>) and OSPF (<xref target="RFC4915"></xref>)
        use static link metrics. Such link metrics can simply reflect the
        bandwidth or can also be computed according to a polynomial function
        of several metrics defining different link characteristics. Some
        routing protocols support more than one metric: in the vast majority
        of the cases, one metric is used per (sub-)topology. Less often, a
        second metric may be used as a tiebreaker in the presence of Equal
        Cost Multiple Paths (ECMPs). The optimization of multiple metrics is
        known as an NP-complete problem and is sometimes supported by some
        centralized path computation engine.</t>

        <t>In contrast, LLNs do require the support of both static and dynamic
        metrics. Furthermore, both link and node metrics are required. In the
        case of RPL, it is virtually impossible to define one metric, or even
        a composite metric, that will satisfy all use cases.</t>

        <t>In addition, RPL supports constraint-based routing where
        constraints may be applied to both link and nodes. If a link or a node
        does not satisfy a required constraint, it is "pruned" from the
        candidate neighbor set, thus leading to a constrained shortest
        path.</t>

        <t>An Objective Function specifies the objectives used to compute the
        (constrained) path. Furthermore, nodes are configured to support a set
        of metrics and constraints and select their parents in the DODAG
        according to the metrics and constraints advertised in the DIO
        messages. Upstream and Downstream metrics may be merged or advertised
        separately depending on the OF and the metrics. When they are
        advertised separately, it may happen that the set of DIO parents is
        different from the set of DAO parents (a DAO parent is a node to which
        unicast DAO messages are sent). Yet, all are DODAG parents with
        regard to the rules for Rank computation.</t>

        <t>The Objective Function is decoupled from the routing metrics and
        constraints used by RPL. Whereas the OF dictates rules such as
        DODAG parent selection, load balancing, and so on, the set of metrics
        and/or constraints used, and thus those that determine the preferred path, are
        based on the information carried within the DAG container option in
        DIO messages.</t>

        <t>The set of supported link/node constraints and metrics is specified

      <section title="Loop Avoidance">
        <t>RPL tries to avoid creating loops when undergoing topology changes
        and includes Rank-based data-path validation mechanisms for detecting
        loops when they do occur (see <xref target="forwarding"></xref> for
        more details). In practice, this means that RPL guarantees neither
        loop-free path selection nor tight delay convergence times, but it can
        detect and repair a loop as soon as it is used. RPL uses this loop
        detection to ensure that packets make forward progress within the
        DODAG Version and trigger repairs when necessary.</t>

        <section title="Greediness and Instability">
          <t>A node is greedy if it attempts to move deeper (increase Rank) in
          the DODAG Version in order to increase the size of the parent set or
          improve some other metric. Once a node has joined a DODAG Version,
          RPL disallows certain behaviors, including greediness, in order to
          prevent resulting instabilities in the DODAG Version.</t>

          <t>Suppose a node is willing to receive and process a DIO message
          from a node in its own sub-DODAG and, in general, a node deeper than
          itself. In this case, a possibility exists that a feedback loop is
          created, wherein two or more nodes continue to try and move in the
          DODAG Version while attempting to optimize against each other. In
          some cases, this will result in instability. It is for this reason
          that RPL limits the cases where a node may process DIO messages from
          deeper nodes to some form of local repair. This approach creates an
          "event horizon", whereby a node cannot be influenced beyond some
          limit into an instability by the action of nodes that may be in its
          own sub-DODAG.</t>

          when DIO messages are missed. Strict use of the DODAGVersionNumber can eliminate this type of loop, but this type of
          loop may possibly be encountered when using some local repair
          mechanisms.</t>

          <t>For example, consider the local repair mechanism that allows a
          node to detach from the DODAG, advertise a Rank of INFINITE_RANK (in
          order to poison its routes / inform its sub-DODAG), and then 
          reattach to the DODAG. In some of these cases, the node may 
          reattach to its own prior-sub-DODAG, causing a DODAG loop, because
          the poisoning may fail if the INFINITE_RANK advertisements are lost
          in the LLN environment. (In this case, the Rank-based data-path

          when a No-Path (a DAO message that invalidates a previously
          announced prefix, see <xref target="DAOOptions" />) was missed and persists until all state has been
          cleaned up. RPL includes an optional mechanism to acknowledge DAO
          messages, which may mitigate the impact of a single DAO message
          being missed. RPL includes loop detection mechanisms that mitigate

        destination advertisement mechanism that provisions Down routes toward
        destinations (prefixes, addresses, or multicast groups), and away from
        roots. Destination advertisements can update routing tables as the
        underlying DODAG topology changes.</t>

      <section title="Point-to-Point Traffic">
        <t>RPL DODAGs provide a basic structure for point-to-point (P2P)
        traffic. For a RPL network to support P2P traffic, a root must be able
        to route packets to a destination. Nodes within the network may also
        have routing tables to destinations. A packet flows towards a root
        until it reaches an ancestor that has a known route to the
        destination. As pointed out later in this document, in the most
        constrained case (when nodes cannot store routes), that common
        ancestor may be the DODAG root. In other cases, it may be a node closer
        to both the source and destination.</t>

        <t>RPL also supports the case where a P2P destination is a 'one-hop'
        neighbor.</t>

        <t>RPL neither specifies nor precludes additional mechanisms for
        computing and installing potentially more optimal routes to support
        arbitrary P2P traffic.</t>

    <section anchor="RPLInstance" title="RPL Instance">
      <t>Within a given LLN, there may be multiple, logically independent RPL
      Instances. A RPL node may belong to multiple RPL Instances, and it may act
      as a router in some and as a leaf in others. This document describes how
      a single instance behaves.</t>

      <t>There are two types of RPL Instances: Local and Global. RPL divides
      the RPLInstanceID space between Global and Local instances to allow for
      both coordinated and unilateral allocation of RPLInstanceIDs. Global RPL
      Instances are coordinated, have one or more DODAGs, and are typically
      long-lived. Local RPL Instances are always a single DODAG whose singular
      root owns the corresponding DODAGID and allocates the local
      RPLInstanceID in a unilateral manner. Local RPL Instances can be used,
      for example, for constructing DODAGs in support of a future on-demand
      routing solution. The mode of operation of Local RPL Instances is out of
      scope for this specification and may be described in other companion
      specifications.</t>

      <t>The definition and provisioning of RPL Instances are out of scope for
      this specification. Guidelines may be application and implementation
      specific, and they are expected to be elaborated in future companion
      specifications. Those operations are expected to be such that data
      packets coming from the outside of the RPL network can unambiguously be
      associated to at least one RPL Instance and be safely routed over any
      instance that would match the packet.</t>

      <t>Control and data packets within RPL network are tagged to
      unambiguously identify of which RPL Instance they are a part.</t>

      <t>Every RPL control message has a RPLInstanceID field. Some RPL control
      messages, when referring to a local RPLInstanceID as defined below, may
      also include a DODAGID.</t>

      <t>Data packets that flow within the RPL network expose the
      RPLInstanceID as part of the RPL Packet Information that RPL requires,
      as further described in <xref target="loopdetect"></xref>. For data
      packets coming from outside the RPL network, the ingress router
      determines the RPLInstanceID and places it into the resulting packet
      that it injects into the RPL network.</t>

      <section anchor="RPLinstanceID" title="RPL Instance ID">
        <t>A global RPLInstanceID MUST be unique to the whole LLN. Mechanisms
        for allocating and provisioning global RPLInstanceID are out of scope
        for this specification. There can be up to 128 Global instance in the
        whole network. Local instances are always used in conjunction with a
        DODAGID (which is either given explicitly or implicitly in some
        cases), and up 64 Local instances per DODAGID can be supported. Local
        instances are allocated and managed by the node that owns the DODAGID,
        without any explicit coordination with other nodes, as further
        detailed below.</t>

        <t>A global RPLInstanceID is encoded in a RPLInstanceID field as
        follows: <figure anchor="GRIDFormat"
            title="RPLInstanceID Field Format for Global Instances">

        <t>A local RPLInstanceID is autoconfigured by the node that owns the
        DODAGID and it MUST be unique for that DODAGID. The DODAGID used to
        configure the local RPLInstanceID MUST be a reachable IPv6 address of
        the node, and it MUST be used as an endpoint of all communications within
        that Local instance.</t>

        <t>A local RPLInstanceID is encoded in a RPLInstanceID field as
        follows: <figure anchor="LRIDFormat"
            title="RPLInstanceID Field Format for Local Instances">

        <t>The 'D' flag in a local RPLInstanceID is always set to 0 in RPL
        control messages. It is used in data packets to indicate whether the
        DODAGID is the source or the destination of the packet. If the 'D' flag
        is set to 1, then the destination address of the IPv6 packet MUST be
        the DODAGID. If the 'D' flag is cleared, then the source address of the
        IPv6 packet MUST be the DODAGID.</t>

        <t>For example, consider a Node A that is the DODAG root of a Local
        RPL Instance, and has allocated a local RPLInstanceID. By definition,
        all traffic traversing that Local RPL Instance will either originate
        or terminate at Node A.&nbsp; In this case, the DODAGID will be the reachable
        IPv6 address of Node A.&nbsp; All traffic will contain the address of
        Node A, and thus the DODAGID, in either the source or destination address.
        Thus, the local RPLInstanceID may indicate that the DODAGID is
        equivalent to either the source address or the destination address by
        setting the 'D' flag appropriately.</t>

      <t>This document defines the RPL control message, a new ICMPv6 <xref

      <t>Most RPL control messages have the scope of a link. The only exception

      exchanged using a unicast address over multiple hops and thus uses
      global or unique-local addresses for both the source and destination
      addresses. For all other RPL control messages, the source address is a
      link-local address, and the destination address is either the
      all-RPL-nodes multicast address or a link-local unicast address of the
      destination. The all-RPL-nodes multicast address is a new address with a
      value of ff02::1a.</t>

      <t>In accordance with <xref target="RFC4443"></xref>, the RPL Control

        <t>Message Authentication Codes (MACs) and signatures provide
        authentication over the entire unsecured ICMPv6 RPL control message,
        including the Security section with all fields defined, but with the

        confidentiality of the secured RPL ICMPv6 message starting at the

        of the packet. The security transformation yields a secured ICMPv6 RPL

        (e.g., the Signature and/or Algorithm in use) will detail how to

        <t>The Destination Advertisement Object (DAO) is used to propagate
        destination information Upward along the DODAG. In Storing mode, the
        DAO message is unicast by the child to the selected parent(s). In

        message may optionally, upon explicit request or error, be
        acknowledged by its destination with a Destination Advertisement
        Acknowledgement (DAO-ACK) message back to the sender of the DAO.</t>

          back into an ND option to advertise in its own RAs so a node attached
          to the RPL router will end up using the DODAG for which the root has
          the best preference for the destination of a packet. In addition to
          the existing ND semantics, it is possible for an Objective Function
          to use this information to favor a DODAG whose root is most
          preferred for a specific destination. The format of the option is

There are 3 instances in this document:

              <postamble>The '*' denotes that the DODAG Parent Address subfield is not always
              present, as described below.</postamble>
            </figure></t>

          <t>The Transit Information option is used for a node to indicate
          attributes for a path to one or more destinations. The destinations
          are indicated by one or more Target options that immediately precede
          the Transit Information option(s).</t>

          <t>The Transit Information option can be used for a node to indicate
          its DODAG parents to an ancestor that is collecting DODAG routing
          information, typically, for the purpose of constructing source
          routes. In the Non-Storing mode of operation, this ancestor will be
          the DODAG root, and this option is carried by the DAO message. In
          the Storing mode of operation, the DODAG Parent Address subfield is not needed,
          since the DAO message is sent directly to the parent. The option
          length is used to determine whether or not the DODAG Parent Address subfield is present.</t>

          <t>A non-storing node that has more than one DAO parent MAY include
          a Transit Information option for each DAO parent as part of the
          non-storing destination advertisement operation. The node may
          distribute the bits in the Path Control field among different groups
          of DAO parents in order to signal a preference among parents. That
          preference may influence the decision of the DODAG root when
          selecting among the alternate parents/paths for constructing
          Downward routes.</t>

          <t>One or more Transit Information options MUST be preceded by one
          or more RPL Target options. In this manner, the RPL Target option
          indicates the child node, and the Transit Information option(s)
          enumerates the DODAG parents. The structure of the DAO message,
          further detailing how Target options are used in conjunction with
          Transit Information options, is further described in <xref
          target="DAOStructure"></xref>.</t>

          <t>A typical non-storing node will use multiple Transit Information
          options, and it will send the DAO message thus formed directly to
          the root. A typical storing node will use one Transit Information
          option with no parent field and will send the DAO message thus
          formed, with additional adjustments, to Path Control as detailed
          later, to one or multiple parents.</t>

          <t>For example, in a Non-Storing mode of operation let Tgt(T) denote
          a Target option for a Target T.&nbsp; Let Trnst(P) denote a Transit
          Information option that contains a parent address P.&nbsp; Consider the
          case of a non-storing Node N that advertises the self-owned targets
          N1 and N2 and has parents P1, P2, and P3. In that case, the DAO
          message would be expected to contain the sequence ((Tgt(N1),
          Tgt(N2)), (Trnst(P1), Trnst(P2), Trnst(P3))), such that the group
          of Target options {N1, N2} is described by the Transit Information
          options as having the parents {P1, P2, P3}. The non-storing node
          would then address that DAO message directly to the DODAG root and
          forward that DAO message through one of the DODAG parents: P1, P2, or
          P3.</t>

              not the DODAG Parent Address subfield is present.</t>

              <t hangText="External (E):">1-bit flag. The 'E' flag is set to
              indicate that the parent router redistributes external targets
              into the RPL network. An external Target is a Target that has
              been learned through an alternate protocol. The external targets
              are listed in the Target options that immediately precede the
              Transit Information option. An external Target is not expected
              to support RPL messages and options.</t>

              <t hangText="Flags:">The 7 bits remaining unused in the Flags
              field are reserved for flags. The field MUST be initialized to
              zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.</t>

              <t hangText="Path Control:">8-bit bit field. The Path Control
              field limits the number of DAO parents to which a DAO message
              advertising connectivity to a specific destination may be sent,
              as well as providing some indication of relative preference. The
              limit provides some bound on overall DAO message fan-out in the
              LLN. The assignment and ordering of the bits in the Path Control
              also serves to communicate preference. Not all of these bits may
              be enabled as according to the PCS in the DODAG Configuration.
              The Path Control field is divided into four subfields that
              contain two bits each: PC1, PC2, PC3, and PC4, as illustrated in
              <xref target="PathControlEncoding"></xref>. The subfields are
              ordered by preference, with PC1 being the most preferred and PC4
              being the least preferred. Within a subfield, there is no order
              of preference. By grouping the parents (as in ECMP) and ordering
              them, the parents may be associated with specific bits in the
              Path Control field in a way that communicates preference.

          <t>The Solicited Information option is used for a node to request
          DIO messages from a subset of neighboring nodes. The Solicited
          Information option may specify a number of predicate criteria to be
          matched by a receiving node. This is used by the requester to limit
          the number of replies from "non-interesting" nodes. These predicates
          affect whether a node resets its DIO Trickle timer, as described in
          <xref target="DIOTransmission"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The Solicited Information option contains flags that indicate
          which predicates a node should check when deciding whether to reset
          its Trickle timer. A node resets its Trickle timer when all
          predicates are true. If a flag is set, then the RPL node MUST check
          the associated predicate. If a flag is cleared, then the RPL node
          MUST NOT check the associated predicate. (If a flag is cleared, the
          RPL node assumes that the associated predicate is true.)</t>

          Information option in <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>, <xref
          target="RFC4862"></xref>, and <xref target="RFC6275"></xref> for use
          by RPL nodes and IPv6 hosts. In particular, a RPL node may use this

<t>If the only desired effect of a received PIO in a DIO is to provide

              set.</t>

              <t hangText="A:">1-bit autonomous address-configuration flag.
              When set, it indicates that this prefix can be used for stateless
              address configuration as specified in <xref
              target="RFC4862"></xref>. When both protocols (ND RAs and RPL
              DIOs) are used to carry PIOs on the same link, it is possible to
              use either one for SLAAC by a RPL node. It is also possible to
              make either protocol ineligible for SLAAC operation by forcing
              the 'A' flag to 0 for PIOs carried in that protocol.</t>

              <t hangText="R:">1-bit router address flag. When set, it indicates
              that the Prefix field contains a complete IPv6 address assigned

              option. The indicated prefix is the first prefix length bits of
              the Prefix field. The router IPv6 address has the same scope and
              conforms to the same lifetime values as the advertised prefix.
              This use of the Prefix field is compatible with its use in
              advertising the prefix itself, since Prefix Advertisement uses
              only the leading bits. Interpretation of this flag bit is thus
              independent of the processing required for the on-link (L) and

    <section anchor="SequenceNumbers" title="Sequence Counters">
      <t>This section describes the general scheme for bootstrap and operation
      of sequence counters in RPL, such as the DODAGVersionNumber in the DIO
      message, the DAOSequence in the DAO message, and the Path Sequence in
      the Transit Information option.</t>

      <section title="Sequence Counter Overview">
        <t>This specification utilizes three different sequence numbers to
        validate the freshness and the synchronization of protocol
        information:</t>

        <t><list hangIndent="24" style="hanging">
            <t hangText="DODAGVersionNumber:">This sequence counter is
            present in the DIO Base to indicate the Version of the DODAG being
            formed. The DODAGVersionNumber is monotonically incremented by the
            root each time the root decides to form a new Version of the DODAG
            in order to revalidate the integrity and allow a global repair to
            occur. The DODAGVersionNumber is propagated unchanged Down the
            DODAG as routers join the new DODAG Version. The
            DODAGVersionNumber is globally significant in a DODAG and
            indicates the Version of the DODAG in which a router is operating.
            An older (lesser) value indicates that the originating router has
            not migrated to the new DODAG Version and cannot be used as a
            parent once the receiving node has migrated to the newer DODAG
            Version.</t>

            <t hangText="DAOSequence:">This sequence counter is present in
            the DAO Base to correlate a DAO message and a DAO ACK message. The
            DAOSequence number is locally significant to the node that issues
            a DAO message for its own consumption to detect the loss of a DAO
            message and enable retries.</t>

            <t hangText="Path Sequence:">This sequence counter is present in
            the Transit Information option in a DAO message. The purpose of
            this counter is to differentiate a movement where a newer route
            supersedes a stale one from a route redundancy scenario where
            multiple routes exist in parallel for the same target. The Path
            Sequence is globally significant in a DODAG and indicates the
            freshness of the route to the associated target. An older (lesser)
            value received from an originating router indicates that the
            originating router holds stale routing states and the originating
            router should not be considered anymore as a potential next hop
            for the target. The Path Sequence is computed by the node that
            advertises the target, that is the Target itself or a router that
            advertises a Target on behalf of a host, and is unchanged as the
            DAO content is propagated towards the root by parent routers. If a
            host does not pass a counter to its router, then the router is in
            charge of computing the Path Sequence on behalf of the host and
            the host can only register to one router for that purpose. If a
            DAO message containing the same Target is issued to multiple parents
            at a given point in time for the purpose of route redundancy, then
            the Path Sequence is the same in all the DAO messages for that
            same target.</t>

      <section title="Sequence Counter Operation">
        <t>RPL sequence counters are subdivided in a 'lollipop' fashion <xref
        target="Perlman83"></xref>, where the values from 128 and greater are
        used as a linear sequence to indicate a restart and bootstrap the
        counter, and the values less than or equal to 127 used as a circular
        sequence number space of size 128 as in <xref
        target="RFC1982"></xref>. Consideration is given to the mode of
        operation when transitioning from the linear region to the circular
        region. Finally, when operating in the circular region, if sequence
        numbers are detected to be too far apart, then they are not comparable,
        as detailed below.</t>

        <t>A window of comparison, SEQUENCE_WINDOW = 16, is configured based
        on a value of 2^N, where N is defined to be 4 in this
        specification.</t>

        <t>For a given sequence counter: <list style="numbers">
            <t>The sequence counter SHOULD be initialized to an implementation
            defined value, which is 128 or greater prior to use. A recommended
            value is 240 (256 - SEQUENCE_WINDOW).</t>

            <t>When a sequence counter increment would cause the sequence
            counter to increment beyond its maximum value, the sequence
            counter MUST wrap back to zero. When incrementing a sequence
            counter greater than or equal to 128, the maximum value is 255.
            When incrementing a sequence counter less than 128, the maximum
            value is 127.</t>

            <t>When comparing two sequence counters, the following rules MUST
            be applied: <list style="numbers">
                <t>When a first sequence counter A is in the interval
                [128..255] and a second sequence counter B is in [0..127]:

                    <t>If (256 + B - A) is less than or equal to
                    SEQUENCE_WINDOW, then B is greater than A, A is less than
                    B, and the two are not equal.</t>

                    <t>If (256 + B - A) is greater than SEQUENCE_WINDOW, then
                    A is greater than B, B is less than A, and the two are not
                    equal.</t>
                  </list> For example, if A is 240, and B is 5, then (256 + 5
                - 240) is 21. 21 is greater than SEQUENCE_WINDOW (16); thus,
                240 is greater than 5. As another example, if A is 250 and B
                is 5, then (256 + 5 - 250) is 11. 11 is less than
                SEQUENCE_WINDOW (16); thus, 250 is less than 5.</t>

                <t>In the case where both sequence counters to be compared are
                less than or equal to 127, and in the case where both sequence
                counters to be compared are greater than or equal to 128:<list

    <section anchor="UpwardRoutes" title="Upward Routes">
      <t>This section describes how RPL discovers and maintains Upward routes.
      It describes the use of DODAG Information Objects (DIOs), the messages
      used to discover and maintain these routes. It specifies how RPL
      generates and responds to DIOs. It also describes DODAG Information
      Solicitation (DIS) messages, which are used to trigger DIO
      transmissions.</t>

      <t>As mentioned in <xref target="daop"></xref>, nodes that decide to
      join a DODAG MUST provision at least one DODAG parent as a default route
      for the associated instance. This default route enables a packet to be
      forwarded Upward until it eventually hits a common ancestor from which
      it will be routed Downward to the destination. If the destination is
      not in the DODAG, then the DODAG root may be able to forward the packet
      using connectivity to the outside of the DODAG; if it cannot forward
      the packet outside, then the DODAG root has to drop it.</t>

      <t>A DIO message can also transport explicit routing information: <list

          <t hangText="DODAGID:">The DODAGID is a Global or Unique Local IPv6

          the DODAGID.</t>

          <t hangText="RIO Prefix:">The root MAY place one or more Route

          incorporates the RIO from <xref target="RFC4191"></xref>. It is
          interpreted as a capability of the root as opposed to a routing
          advertisement, and it MUST NOT be redistributed in another routing
          protocol though it SHOULD be used by an ingress RPL router to select
          a DODAG when a packet is injected in a RPL domain from a node
          attached to that RPL router. An Objective Function MAY use the
          routes advertised in RIO or the preference for those routes in order

      <section anchor="DAGDiscovery"
               title="Upward Route Discovery and Maintenance">
        <t>Upward route discovery allows a node to join a DODAG by discovering
        neighbors that are members of the DODAG of interest and identifying a
        set of parents. The exact policies for selecting neighbors and parents
        is implementation dependent and driven by the OF. This section
        specifies the set of rules those policies must follow for
        interoperability.</t>

        <section anchor="parentset"
                 title="Neighbors and Parents within a DODAG Version">
          <t>RPL's Upward route discovery algorithms and processing are in
          terms of three logical sets of link-local nodes. First, the
          candidate neighbor set is a subset of the nodes that can be reached
          via link-local multicast. The selection of this set is
          implementation and OF dependent. Second, the parent set is
          a restricted subset of the candidate neighbor set. Finally, the
          preferred parent is a member of the parent set that is the preferred
          next hop in Upward routes. Conceptually, the preferred parent is a
          single parent; although, it may be a set of multiple parents if those
          parents are equally preferred and have identical Rank.</t>

          <t>More precisely: <list style="numbers">
              <t>The DODAG parent set MUST be a subset of the candidate
              neighbor set.</t>

              <t>A DODAG root MUST have a DODAG parent set of size zero.</t>

              <t>A node that is not a DODAG root MAY maintain a DODAG parent
              set of size greater than or equal to one.</t>

              <t>A node's preferred DODAG parent MUST be a member of its DODAG
              parent set.</t>

              <t>A node's Rank MUST be greater than all elements of its DODAG
              parent set.</t>

              <t>When Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD) <xref
              target="RFC4861"></xref>, or an equivalent mechanism, determines
              that a neighbor is no longer reachable, a RPL node MUST NOT
              consider this node in the candidate neighbor set when
              calculating and advertising routes until it determines that it
              is again reachable. Routes through an unreachable neighbor MUST
              be removed from the routing table.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>These rules ensure that there is a consistent partial order on
          nodes within the DODAG. As long as node Ranks do not change,
          following the above rules ensures that every node's route to a DODAG
          root is loop-free, as Rank decreases on each hop to the root.</t>

                from each DODAG parent, MUST belong to the same DODAG Version.
                Elements of a node's candidate neighbor set MAY belong to
                different DODAG Versions.</t>

                <t>A node is a member of a DODAG Version if every element of
                its DODAG parent set belongs to that DODAG Version, or if that
                node is the root of the corresponding DODAG.</t>

                <t>A node MUST NOT send DIOs for DODAG Versions of which it is
                not a member.</t>

                <t>DODAG roots MAY increment the DODAGVersionNumber that they
                advertise and thus move to a new DODAG Version. When a DODAG
                root increments its DODAGVersionNumber, it MUST follow the
                conventions of Serial Number Arithmetic as described in <xref
                target="SequenceNumbers"></xref>. Events triggering the
                increment of the DODAGVersionNumber are described later in
                this section and in <xref target="Manageability"></xref>.</t>

                <t>Within a given DODAG, a node that is a not a root MUST NOT
                advertise a DODAGVersionNumber higher than the highest
                DODAGVersionNumber it has heard. Higher is defined as the
                greater-than operator in <xref
                target="SequenceNumbers"></xref>.</t>

                <t>Once a node has advertised a DODAG Version by sending a
                DIO, it MUST NOT be a member of a previous DODAG Version of
                the same DODAG (i.e., with the same RPLInstanceID, the same
                DODAGID, and a lower DODAGVersionNumber). Lower is defined as
                the less-than operator in <xref
                target="SequenceNumbers"></xref>.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>When the DODAG parent set becomes empty on a node that is not a
            root, (i.e., the last parent has been removed, causing the node no longer to
            be associated with that DODAG), then the DODAG
            information should not be suppressed until after the expiration of
            an implementation-specific local timer. During the interval prior
            to suppression of the "old" DODAG state, the node will be able to
            observe if the DODAGVersionNumber has been incremented should any
            new parents appear. This will help protect against the possibility
            of loops that may occur if that node were to inadvertently rejoin
            the old DODAG Version in its own prior sub-DODAG.</t>

            <t>As the DODAGVersionNumber is incremented, a new DODAG Version
            spreads outward from the DODAG root. A parent that advertises the
            new DODAGVersionNumber cannot belong to the sub-DODAG of a node
            advertising an older DODAGVersionNumber. Therefore, a node can
            safely add a parent of any Rank with a newer DODAGVersionNumber
            without forming a loop.</t>

            <t>For example, suppose that a node has left a DODAG with
            DODAGVersionNumber N.&nbsp; Suppose that a node had a sub-DODAG and did
            attempt to poison that sub-DODAG by advertising a Rank of
            INFINITE_RANK, but those advertisements may have become lost in
            the LLN. Then, if the node did observe a candidate neighbor
            advertising a position in that original DODAG at
            DODAGVersionNumber N, that candidate neighbor could possibly have
            been in the node's former sub-DODAG, and there is a possible case
            where adding that candidate neighbor as a parent could cause a
            loop. In this case, if that candidate neighbor is observed to
            advertise a DODAGVersionNumber N+1, then that candidate neighbor
            is certain to be safe, since it is certain not to be in that
            original node's sub-DODAG, as it has been able to increment the
            DODAGVersionNumber by hearing from the DODAG root while that
            original node was detached. For this reason, it is
            useful for the detached node to remember the original DODAG
            information, including the DODAGVersionNumber N.</t>

            <t>Exactly when a DODAG root increments the DODAGVersionNumber is
            implementation dependent and out of scope for this specification.
            Examples include incrementing the DODAGVersionNumber periodically,
            upon administrative intervention, or on application-level
            detection of lost connectivity or DODAG inefficiency.</t>

            <t>After a node transitions to and advertises a new DODAG Version,
            the rules above make it unable to advertise the previous DODAG
            Version (prior DODAGVersionNumber) once it has committed to
            advertising the new DODAG Version.</t>

            virtual root of the DODAG and exposes a Rank of BASE_RANK over
            the backbone. All the LLN roots that are parented to that backbone
            root, including the backbone root if it also serves as the LLN root
            itself, expose a Rank of ROOT_RANK to the LLN. These virtual roots
            are part of the same DODAG and advertise the same DODAGID. They
            coordinate DODAGVersionNumbers and other DODAG parameters with the

            <t>The Objective Function and the set of advertised routing

                rule: a node MAY advertise an INFINITE_RANK within a DODAG

                higher than allowed by L + DAGMaxRankIncrease, when it

            <t>Conceptually, an implementation is maintaining a DODAG parent
            set within the DODAG Version. Movement entails changes to the
            DODAG parent set. Moving Up does not present the risk to create a
            loop but moving Down might, so that operation is subject to
            additional constraints.</t>

            <t>When a node migrates to the next DODAG Version, the DODAG
            parent set needs to be rebuilt for the new Version. An
            implementation could defer to migrate for some reasonable amount
            of time, to see if some other neighbors with potentially better
            metrics but higher Rank announce themselves. Similarly, when a
            node jumps into a new DODAG, it needs to construct a new DODAG
            parent set for this new DODAG.</t>

            <t>If a node needs to move Down a DODAG that it is attached to,
            increasing its Rank, then it MAY poison its routes and delay
            before moving as described in <xref
            target="DAGDiscoveryRulesPoison"></xref>.</t>

            <t>A node is allowed to join any DODAG Version that it has never
            been a prior member of without any restrictions, but if the node
            has been a prior member of the DODAG Version, then it must continue
            to observe the rule that it may not advertise a Rank higher than
            L+DAGMaxRankIncrease at any point in the life of the DODAG
            Version. This rule must be observed so as not to create a loophole
            that would allow the node to effectively increment its Rank all
            the way to INFINITE_RANK, which may have impact on other nodes and
            create a resource-wasting count-to-infinity scenario.</t>

        <t>A particular case that requires a leaf node to send a DIO is if
        that leaf node was a prior member of another DODAG and another node
        forwards a message assuming the old topology, triggering an
        inconsistency. The leaf node needs to transmit a DIO in order to
        repair the inconsistency. Note that due to the lossy nature of LLNs,
        even though the leaf node may have optimistically poisoned its routes
        by advertising a Rank of INFINITE_RANK in the old DODAG prior to
        becoming a leaf node, that advertisement may have become lost and a
        leaf node must be capable to send a DIO later in order to repair the
        inconsistency.</t>

        <t>In the general case, the leaf node MUST NOT advertise itself as a
        router (i.e., send DIOs).</t>

      <section title="Administrative Rank">
        <t>In some cases, it might be beneficial to adjust the Rank advertised
        by a node beyond that computed by the OF based on some implementation-specific policy and properties of the node. For example, a node that

    <section anchor="DownwardRoutes" title="Downward Routes">
      <t>This section describes how RPL discovers and maintains Downward
      routes. RPL constructs and maintains Downward routes with Destination
      Advertisement Object (DAO) messages. Downward routes support P2MP flows,
      from the DODAG roots toward the leaves. Downward routes also support P2P
      flows: P2P messages can flow toward a DODAG root (or a common ancestor)
      through an Upward route, then away from the DODAG root to a destination
      through a Downward route.</t>

      <t>This specification describes the two modes a RPL Instance may choose
      from for maintaining Downward routes. In the first mode, called
      "Storing", nodes store Downward routing tables for their sub-DODAG. Each
      hop on a Downward route in a storing network examines its routing table
      to decide on the next hop. In the second mode, called "Non-Storing",
      nodes do not store Downward routing tables. Downward packets are routed
      with source routes populated by a DODAG root <xref
      target="RFC6554"></xref>.</t>

      <t>RPL allows a simple one-hop P2P optimization for both storing and
      non-storing networks. A node may send a P2P packet destined to a one-hop
      neighbor directly to that node.</t>

      <section title="Destination Advertisement Parents">
        <t>To establish Downward routes, RPL nodes send DAO messages Upward.
        The next-hop destinations of these DAO messages are called "DAO
        parents". The collection of a node's DAO parents is called the "DAO
        parent set".</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>A node MAY send DAO messages using the all-RPL-nodes multicast
            address, which is an optimization to provision one-hop routing.
            The 'K' bit MUST be cleared on transmission of the multicast
            DAO.</t>

            <t>A node's DAO parent set MUST be a subset of its DODAG parent
            set.</t>

            <t>In Storing mode operation, a node MUST NOT address unicast DAO
            messages to nodes that are not DAO parents.</t>

            <t>In Storing mode operation, the IPv6 source and destination
            addresses of a DAO message MUST be link-local addresses.</t>

            <t>In Non-Storing mode operation, a node MUST NOT address unicast
            DAO messages to nodes that are not DODAG roots.</t>

            <t>In Non-Storing mode operation, the IPv6 source and destination
            addresses of a DAO message MUST be a unique-local or a global
            address.</t>

        <t>Destination Advertisement may be configured to be entirely

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>All nodes who join a DODAG MUST abide by the MOP setting from

            participate as a router, e.g., that do not match the advertised
            MOP, MAY join the DODAG as a leaf.</t>

            <t>If the MOP is 0, indicating no Downward routing, nodes MUST NOT
            transmit DAO messages and MAY ignore DAO messages.</t>

            <t>In Non-Storing mode, the DODAG root SHOULD store source routing
            table entries for destinations learned from DAOs. The DODAG root
            MUST be able to generate source routes for those destinations
            learned from DAOs that were stored.</t>

            <t>In Storing mode, all non-root, non-leaf nodes MUST store
            routing table entries for destinations learned from DAOs.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>A DODAG can have one of several possible modes of operation, as
        defined by the MOP field. Either it does not support Downward routes,
        it supports Downward routes through source routing from DODAG roots,
        or it supports Downward routes through in-network routing tables.</t>

        <t>When Downward routes are supported through source routing from
        DODAG roots, it is generally expected that the DODAG root has stored
        the source routing information learned from DAOs in order to construct
        the source routes. If the DODAG root fails to store some information,
        then some destinations may be unreachable.</t>

        <t>When Downward routes are supported through in-network routing
        tables, the multicast operation defined in this specification may or
        may not be supported, also as indicated by the MOP field.</t>

        <t>When Downward routes are supported through in-network routing
        tables, as described in this specification, it is expected that nodes
        acting as routers have been provisioned sufficiently to hold the
        required routing table state. If a node acting as a router is unable
        to hold the full routing table state then the routing state is not
        complete, messages may be dropped as a consequence, and a fault may be
        logged (<xref target="mgmtFault"></xref>). Future extensions to RPL
        may elaborate on refined actions/behaviors to manage this case.</t>

        <t>As of the writing of this specification, RPL does not support mixed-mode operation,
        where some nodes source route and other store routing tables: future
        extensions to RPL may support this mode of operation.</t>

        <section title="Maintenance of Path Sequence">

          counter in the Transit information option is used to indicate

          its DAO parents in order to enable multipath. All DAOs generated at
          the same time for the same Target MUST be sent with the same Path

          of receiving DAOs, it matters whether the DAO message is "new" or
          contains new information. In Non-Storing mode, every DAO message a

      <section anchor="DAOStructure" title="Structure of DAO Messages">
        <t>DAOs follow a common structure in both storing and non-storing
        networks. In the most general form, a DAO message may include several
        groups of options, where each group consists of one or more Target
        options followed by one or more Transit Information options. The
        entire group of Transit Information options applies to the entire
        group of Target options. Later sections describe further details for
        each mode of operation.</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>RPL nodes MUST include one or more RPL Target options in each
            DAO message they transmit. One RPL Target option MUST have a
            prefix that includes the node's IPv6 address if that node needs
            the DODAG to provision Downward routes to that node. The RPL
            Target option MAY be immediately followed by an opaque RPL Target
            Descriptor option that qualifies it.</t>

            <t>When a node updates the information in a Transit Information
            option for a Target option that covers one of its addresses, it
            MUST increment the Path Sequence number in that Transit
            Information option. The Path Sequence number MAY be incremented
            occasionally to cause a refresh to the Downward routes.</t>

            <t>One or more RPL Target options in a unicast DAO message MUST be
            followed by one or more Transit Information options. All the
            transit options apply to all the Target options that immediately
            precede them.</t>

            <t>Multicast DAOs MUST NOT include the DODAG Parent Address subfield in Transit
            Information options.</t>

            <t>A node that receives and processes a DAO message containing
            information for a specific Target, and that has prior information
            for that Target, MUST use the Path Sequence number in the Transit
            Information option associated with that Target in order to
            determine whether or not the DAO message contains updated
            information per <xref target="SequenceNumbers"></xref>.</t>

        <t>In Non-Storing mode, the root builds a strict source routing
        header, hop-by-hop, by recursively looking up one-hop information that
        ties a Target (address or prefix) and a transit address together. In
        some cases, when a child address is derived from a prefix that is
        owned and advertised by a parent, that parent-child relationship may
        be inferred by the root for the purpose of constructing the source
        routing header. In all other cases, it is necessary to inform the root
        of the transit-Target relationship from a reachable target, so as to
        later enable the recursive construction of the routing header. An
        address that is advertised as a Target in a DAO message MUST be
        collocated in the same router, or reachable on-link by the router that
        owns the address that is indicated in the associated Transit
        Information. The following additional rules apply to ensure the
        continuity of the end-to-end source route path:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>The address of a parent used in the transit option MUST be
            taken from a PIO from that parent with the 'R' flag set. The 'R'
            flag in a PIO indicates that the prefix field actually contains
            the full parent address but the child SHOULD NOT assume that the
            parent address is on-link.</t>

            <t>A PIO with an 'A' flag set indicates that the RPL child node may
            use the prefix to autoconfigure an address. A parent that
            advertises a prefix in a PIO with the 'A' flag set MUST ensure
            that the address or the whole prefix in the PIO is reachable from
            the root by advertising it as a DAO target. If the parent also
            sets the 'L' flag indicating that the prefix is on-link, then it
            MUST advertise the whole prefix as Target in a DAO message. If
       the 'L' flag is cleared and the 'R' flag is set, indicating that
       the parent provides its own address in the PIO, then the parent 
       MUST advertise that address as a DAO target.</t>

            <t>An address that is advertised as Target in a DAO message MUST
            be collocated in the same router or reachable on-link by the router
            that owns the address that is indicated in the associated Transit
            Information.</t>

            <t>In order to enable an optimum compression of the routing
            header, the parent SHOULD set the 'R' flag in all PIOs with the
            'A' flag set and the 'L' flag cleared, and the child SHOULD prefer
            to use as transit the address of the parent that is found in the
            PIO that is used to autoconfigure the address that is advertised
            as Target in the DAO message.</t>

            <t>A router might have targets that are not known to be on-link
            for a parent, either because they are addresses located on an
            alternate interface or because they belong to nodes that are
            external to RPL, for instance connected hosts. In order to inject
            such a Target in the RPL network, the router MUST advertise itself
            as the DODAG Parent Address subfield in the Transit Information option for that
            target, using an address that is on-link for that nodes DAO
            parent. If the Target belongs to an external node, then the router
            MUST set the External 'E' flag in the Transit Information.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>A child node that has autoconfigured an address from a parent PIO
        with the 'L' flag set does not need to advertise that address as a DAO
        Target since the parent ensures that the whole prefix is already
        reachable from the root. However, if the 'L' flag is not set, then it is
        necessary, in Non-Storing mode, for the child node to inform the root of
        the parent-child relationship, using a reachable address of the
        parent, so as to enable the recursive construction of the routing
        header. This is done by associating an address of the parent as
        transit with the address of the child as Target in a DAO message.</t>

      <section title="Triggering DAO Messages">
        <t>Nodes can trigger their sub-DODAG to send DAO messages. Each node

        through DIO messages.</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>If a node hears one of its DAO parents increment its DTSN, the

            target="ScheduleDAO" format="counter"></xref>.</t>

            <t>In Non-Storing mode, if a node hears one of its DAO parents
            increment its DTSN, the node MUST increment its own DTSN.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In a Storing mode of operation, as part of routine routing table
        updates and maintenance, a storing node MAY increment DTSN in order to
        reliably trigger a set of DAO updates from its immediate children. In
        a Storing mode of operation, it is not necessary to trigger DAO updates
        from the entire sub-DODAG, since that state information will propagate
        hop-by-hop Up the DODAG.</t>

        <t>In a Non-Storing mode of operation, a DTSN increment will also
        cause the immediate children of a node to increment their DTSN in
        turn, triggering a set of DAO updates from the entire sub-DODAG. Typically, in a
        Non-Storing mode of operation, only the root would
        independently increment the DTSN when a DAO refresh is needed but a
        global repair (such as by incrementing DODAGVersionNumber) is not
        desired. Typically, in a Non-Storing mode of operation, all non-root
        nodes would increment their DTSN only when their parent(s) are
        observed to do so.</t>

        <t>In general, a node may trigger DAO updates according to
        implementation-specific logic, such as based on the detection of a
        Downward route inconsistency or occasionally based upon an internal
        timer.</t>

        <t>  In a storing network, selecting a proper DelayDAO for triggered DAOs 
  can  greatly reduce the number of DAOs transmitted.  The trigger
flows
  Down the DODAG; in the best case, the DAOs flow Up the DODAG such
  that leaves send DAOs first, with each node sending a DAO message
  only once.  Such a scheduling could be approximated by setting
  DelayDAO inversely proportional to Rank.  Note that this suggestion
  is intended as an optimization to allow efficient aggregation (it is
  not required for correct operation in the general case).</t>

            <t>DAOs are sent directly to the root along a default route
            installed as part of the parent selection.</t>

            <t>When a node removes a node from its DAO parent set, it MAY
            generate a new DAO message with an updated Transit Information
            option.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In Non-Storing mode, a node uses DAOs to report its DAO parents to
        the DODAG root. The DODAG root can piece together a Downward route to
        a node by using DAO parent sets from each node in the route. The Path
        Sequence information may be used to detect stale DAO information. The
        purpose of this per-hop route calculation is to minimize traffic when
        DAO parents change. If nodes reported complete source routes, then on
        a DAO parent change, the entire sub-DODAG would have to send new DAOs
        to the DODAG root. Therefore, in Non-Storing mode, a node can send a
        single DAO, although it might choose to send more than one DAO message
        to each of multiple DAO parents.</t>

        <t>Nodes pack DAOs by sending a single DAO message with multiple RPL
        Target options. Each RPL Target option has its own, immediately
        following, Transit Information options.</t>

      <section anchor="DAOStoring" title="Storing Mode">
        <t>In Storing mode, RPL routes messages Downward by the IPv6
        destination address. The following rules apply to nodes that are in
        Storing mode:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>The DODAG Parent Address subfield of a Transmit Information option MUST
            be empty.</t>

            <t>On receiving a unicast DAO, a node MUST compute if the DAO
            would change the set of prefixes that the node itself advertises.
            This computation SHOULD include consultation of the Path Sequence
            information in the Transit Information options associated with the
            DAO, to determine if the DAO message contains newer information
            that supersedes the information already stored at the node. If so,
            the node MUST generate a new DAO message and transmit it,
            following the rules in <xref target="ScheduleDAO"></xref>. Such a
            change includes receiving a No-Path DAO.</t>

            <t>When a node generates a new DAO, it SHOULD unicast it to each
            of its DAO parents. It MUST NOT unicast the DAO message to nodes
            that are not DAO parents.</t>

            <t>When a node removes a node from its DAO parent set, it SHOULD
            send a No-Path DAO message (<xref target="DAOOptions"></xref>) to
            that removed DAO parent to invalidate the existing route.</t>

            <t>If messages to an advertised Downward address suffer from a
            forwarding error, Neighbor Unreachable Detection (NUD), or similar
            failure, a node MAY mark the address as unreachable and generate
            an appropriate No-Path DAO.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>DAOs advertise to which destination addresses and prefixes a node has
        routes. Unlike in Non-Storing mode, these DAOs do not communicate
        information about the routes themselves: that information is stored
        within the network and is implicit from the IPv6 source address. When
        a storing node generates a DAO, it uses the stored state of DAOs it
        has received to produce a set of RPL Target options and their
        associated Transmit Information options.</t>

        <t>Because this information is stored within each node's routing
        tables, in Storing mode, DAOs are communicated directly to DAO parents,
        who store this information.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="PathControl" title="Path Control">
        <t>A DAO message from a node contains one or more Target options. Each
        Target option specifies either a prefix advertised by the node, a
        prefix of addresses reachable outside the LLN, the address of a
        destination in the node's sub-DODAG, or a multicast group to which a node
        in the sub-DODAG is listening. The Path Control field of the
        Transit Information option allows nodes to request or allow for
        multiple Downward routes. A node constructs the Path Control field of
        a Transit Information option as follows:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>The bit width of the Path Control field MUST be equal to the
            value (PCS + 1), where PCS is specified in the control field of
            the DODAG Configuration option. Bits greater than or equal to the
            value (PCS + 1) MUST be cleared on transmission and MUST be
            ignored on reception. Bits below that value are considered
            "active" bits.</t>

            <t>The node MUST logically construct groupings of its DAO parents
            while populating the Path Control field, where each group consists
            of DAO parents of equal preference. Those groups MUST then be
            ordered according to preference, which allows for a logical
            mapping of DAO parents onto Path Control subfields (see <xref
            target="PathControlEncoding"></xref>). Groups MAY be repeated in
            order to extend over the entire bit width of the patch control
            field, but the order, including repeated groups, MUST be retained
            so that preference is properly communicated.</t>

            <t>For a RPL Target option describing a node's own address or a
            prefix outside the LLN, at least one active bit of the Path
            Control field MUST be set. More active bits of the Path Control
            field MAY be set.</t>

            <t>If a node receives multiple DAOs with the same RPL Target
            option, it MUST bitwise-OR the Path Control fields it receives.
            This aggregated bitwise-OR represents the number of Downward
            routes the prefix requests.</t>

            <t>When a node sends a DAO message to one of its DAO parents, it
            MUST select one or more of the bits that are set active in the
            subfield that is mapped to the group containing that DAO parent
            from the aggregated Path Control field. A given bit can only be
            presented as active to one parent. The DAO message it transmits to
            its parent MUST have these active bits set and all other active
            bits cleared.</t>

            <t>For the RPL Target option and DAOSequence number, the DAOs a
            node sends to different DAO parents MUST have disjoint sets of
            active Path Control bits. A node MUST NOT set the same active bit
            on DAOs to two different DAO parents.</t>

            <t>Path Control bits SHOULD be allocated according to the
            preference mapping of DAO parents onto Path Control subfields,
            such that the active Path Control bits, or groupings of bits, that
            belong to a particular Path Control subfield are allocated to DAO
            parents within the group that was mapped to that subfield.</t>

            <t>In a Non-Storing mode of operation, a node MAY pass DAOs
            through without performing any further processing on the Path
            Control field.</t>

            <t>A node MUST NOT unicast a DAO message that has no active bits
            in the Path Control field set. It is possible that, for a given
            Target option, a node does not have enough aggregate Path
            Control bits to send a DAO message containing that Target to each
            of its DAO parents, in which case those least preferred DAO
            Parents may not get a DAO message for that Target.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The Path Control field allows a node to bound how many Downward
        routes will be generated to it. It sets a number of bits in the Path
        Control field equal to the maximum number of Downward routes it
        prefers. At most, each bit is sent to one DAO parent; clusters of bits
        can be sent to a single DAO parent for it to divide among its own DAO
        parents.</t>

        <t>A node that provisions a DAO route for a Target that has an
        associated Path Control field SHOULD use the content of that Path
        Control field in order to determine an order of preference among
        multiple alternative DAO routes for that Target. The Path Control
        field assignment is derived from preference (of the DAO parents), as
        determined on the basis of this node's best knowledge of the
        "end-to-end" aggregated metrics in the Downward direction as per the
        Objective Function. In Non-Storing mode the root can determine the
        Downward route by aggregating the information from each received DAO,
        which includes the Path Control indications of preferred DAO
        parents.</t>

        <section anchor="PathControlExample" title="Path Control Example">
          <t>Suppose that there is an LLN operating in Storing mode that
          contains a Node N with four parents, P1, P2, P3, and P4. Let N have
          three children, C1, C2, and C3 in its sub-DODAG. Let PCS be 7, such
          that there will be 8 active bits in the Path Control field:
          11111111b. Consider the following example:</t>

          <t>The Path Control field is split into four subfields, PC1
          (11000000b), PC2 (00110000b), PC3 (00001100b), and PC4 (00000011b),

          preference per <xref target="PathControlEncoding"></xref>. The
          implementation at Node N, in this example, groups {P1, P2} to be of
          equal preference to each other and the most preferred group
          overall. {P3} is less preferred to {P1, P2}, and more preferred to
          {P4}. Let Node N then perform its Path Control mapping such that:

           {P4}     -> PC3 (00001100b) in the Path Control field

]]></artwork>
            </figure>Note that the implementation repeated {P4} in order to
          get complete coverage of the Path Control field.</t>

          <t><list style="numbers">
              <t>Let C1 send a DAO containing a Target T with a Path Control
              10000000b. Node N stores an entry associating 10000000b with the
              Path Control field for C1 and Target T.</t>

              <t>Let C2 send a DAO containing a Target T with a Path Control
              00010000b. Node N stores an entry associating 00010000b with the

              Path Control field for C1 and Target T.</t>

              <t>At some later time, Node N generates a DAO for Target T.&nbsp; Node
              N will construct an aggregate Path Control field by ORing
              together the contribution from each of its children that have
              given a DAO for Target T.&nbsp; Thus, the aggregate Path Control field
              has the active bits set as: 10011100b.</t>

              <t>Node N then distributes the aggregate Path Control bits among
              its parents P1, P2, P3, and P4 in order to prepare the DAO
              messages.</t>

              <t>P1 and P2 are eligible to receive active bits from the most
              preferred subfield (11000000b). Those bits are 10000000b in the
              aggregate Path Control field. Node N must set the bit to one of the
              two parents only. In this case, Node P1 is allocated the bit
              and gets the Path Control field 10000000b for its DAO. There are
              no bits left to allocate to Node P2; thus, Node P2 would have a
              Path Control field of 00000000b and a DAO cannot be generated to
              Node P2 since there are no active bits.</t>

              <t>The second-most preferred subfield (00110000b) has the active
              bits 00010000b. Node N has mapped P3 to this subfield. Node N
              may allocates the active bit to P3, constructing a DAO for P3
              containing Target T with a Path Control of 00010000b.</t>

              <t>The third-most preferred subfield (00001100b) has the active
              bits 00001100b. Node N has mapped P4 to this subfield. Node N
              may allocate both bits to P4, constructing a DAO for P4
              containing Target T with a Path Control of 00001100b.</t>

              <t>The least preferred subfield (00000011b) has no active bits.
              Had there been active bits, those bits would have been added to
              the Path Control field of the DAO constructed for P4.</t>

              <t>The process of populating the DAO messages destined for P1,
              P2, P3, P4 with other targets (other than T) proceeds

    <section anchor="SecurityMechanisms" title="Security Mechanisms">
      <t>This section describes the generation and processing of secure RPL
      messages. The high-order bit of the RPL message code identifies whether or not
      a RPL message is secure. In addition to secure versions of basic
      control messages (DIS, DIO, DAO, DAO-ACK), RPL has several messages
      that are relevant only in networks that are security enabled.</t>

      <t>Implementation complexity and size is a core concern for LLNs such
      that it may be economically or physically impossible to include
      sophisticated security provisions in a RPL implementation. Furthermore,
      many deployments can utilize link-layer or other security mechanisms to
      meet their security requirements without requiring the use of security
      in RPL.</t>

      <t>Therefore, the security features described in this document are
      OPTIONAL to implement. A given implementation MAY support a subset
      (including the empty set) of the described security features, for
      example, it could support integrity and confidentiality, but not
      signatures. An implementation SHOULD clearly specify which security
      mechanisms are supported, and it is RECOMMENDED that implementers
      carefully consider security requirements and the availability of
      security mechanisms in their network.</t>

      <section anchor="SecurityOverview" title="Security Overview">
        <t>RPL supports three security modes:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Unsecured. In this security mode, RPL uses basic DIS, DIO, DAO,
            and DAO-ACK messages, which do not have Security sections. As a
            network could be using other security mechanisms, such as
            link-layer security, unsecured mode does not imply all messages
            are sent without any protection.</t>

            <t>Preinstalled. In this security mode, RPL uses secure messages.
            To join a RPL Instance, a node must have a preinstalled key.
            Nodes use this to provide message confidentiality, integrity, and
            authenticity. A node may, using this preinstalled key, join the
            RPL network as either a host or a router.</t>

            <t>Authenticated. In this security mode, RPL uses secure messages.
            To join a RPL Instance, a node must have a preinstalled key.
            Nodes use this key to provide message confidentiality, integrity,
            and authenticity. Using this preinstalled key, a node may join the
            network as a host only. To join the network as a router, a node
            must obtain a second key from a key authority. This key authority
            can authenticate that the requester is allowed to be a router
            before providing it with the second key. Authenticated mode cannot
            be supported by symmetric algorithms. As of the writing of this specification,
            RPL supports only symmetric algorithms: authenticated mode is
            included for the benefit of potential future cryptographic
            primitives. See <xref target="KeyInstallation"></xref>.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Whether or not the RPL Instance uses unsecured mode is signaled by
        whether it uses secure RPL messages. Whether a secured network uses
        the preinstalled or authenticated mode is signaled by the 'A' bit of
        the DAG Configuration option.</t>

        <t>This specification specifies CCM -- Counter with CBC-MAC (Cipher
        Block Chaining - Message Authentication Code) -- as the cryptographic
        basis for RPL security <xref target="RFC3610"></xref>. In this
        specification, CCM uses AES-128 as its underlying cryptographic
        algorithm. There are bits reserved in the Security section to specify
        other algorithms in the future.</t>

        <t>All secured RPL messages have either a MAC or a signature. Optionally, secured RPL messages also have
        encryption protection for confidentiality. Secured RPL message formats
        support both integrated encryption/authentication schemes (e.g., CCM)
        as well as schemes that separately encrypt and authenticate
        packets.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="SecureJoining" title="Joining a Secure Network">
        <t>RPL security assumes that a node wishing to join a secured network
        has been pre-configured with a shared key for communicating with
        neighbors and the RPL root. To join a secure RPL network, a node
        either listens for secure DIOs or triggers secure DIOs by sending a
        secure DIS. In addition to the DIO/DIS rules in <xref
        target="UpwardRoutes"></xref>, secure DIO and DIS messages have these
        rules:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>If sent, this initial secure DIS MUST set the Key Identifier
            Mode field to 0 (00) and MUST set the Security Level field to 1
            (001). The key used MUST be the pre-configured group key (Key Index
            0x00).</t>

            <t>When a node resets its Trickle timer in response to a secure
            DIS (<xref target="DIOTransmission"></xref>), the next DIO it
            transmits MUST be a secure DIO with the same security
            configuration as the secure DIS. If a node receives multiple
            secure DIS messages before it transmits a DIO, the secure DIO MUST
            have the same security configuration as the last DIS to which it is
            responding.</t>

            <t>When a node sends a DIO in response to a unicast secure DIS
            (<xref target="DIOTransmission"></xref>), the DIO MUST be a secure
            DIO.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The above rules allow a node to join a secured RPL Instance using
        the pre-configured shared key. Once a node has joined the DODAG using
        the pre-configured shared key, the 'A' bit of the Configuration option
        determines its capabilities. If the 'A' bit of the Configuration option is
        cleared, then nodes can use this preinstalled, shared key to exchange
        messages normally: it can issue DIOs, DAOs, etc.</t>

        <t>If the 'A' bit of the Configuration option is set and the RPL
        Instance is operating in authenticated mode:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>A node MUST NOT advertise a Rank besides INFINITE_RANK in
            secure DIOs secured with Key Index 0x00. When processing DIO
            messages secured with Key Index 0x00, a processing node MUST
            consider the advertised Rank to be INFINITE_RANK. Any other value
            results in the message being discarded.</t>

            <t>Secure DAOs using a Key Index 0x00 MUST NOT have a RPL Target
            option with a prefix besides the node's address. If a node
            receives a secured DAO message using the preinstalled, shared key
            where the RPL Target option does not match the IPv6 source
            address, it MUST discard the secured DAO message without further
            processing.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The above rules mean that in RPL Instances where the 'A' bit is
        set, using Key Index 0x00, a node can join the RPL Instance as a host
        but not a router. A node must communicate with a key authority to
        obtain a key that will enable it to act as a router.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="KeyInstallation" title="Installing Keys">
        <t>Authenticated mode requires a would-be router to dynamically
        install new keys once they have joined a network as a host. Having
        joined as a host, the node uses standard IP messaging to communicate
        with an authorization server, which can provide new keys.</t>

        <t>The protocol to obtain such keys is out of scope for this
        specification and to be elaborated in future specifications. That
        elaboration is required for RPL to securely operate in authenticated
        mode.</t>

      <section anchor="ConsistencyChecks" title="Consistency Checks">
        <t>RPL nodes send Consistency Check (CC) messages to protect against
        replay attacks and synchronize counters.</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>If a node receives a unicast CC message with the 'R' bit cleared,
            and it is a member of or is in the process of joining the
            associated DODAG, it SHOULD respond with a unicast CC message to
            the sender. This response MUST have the 'R' bit set, and it MUST have
            the same CC nonce, RPLInstanceID, and DODAGID fields as the message
            it received.</t>

            <t>If a node receives a multicast CC message, it MUST discard the
            message with no further processing.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Consistency Check messages allow nodes to issue a
        challenge-response to validate a node's current counter value. Because
        the CC nonce is generated by the challenger, an adversary replaying
        messages is unlikely to be able to generate a correct response. The
        counter in the Consistency Check response allows the challenger to
        validate the counter values it hears.</t>

      <section anchor="SecurityCounter" title="Counters">
        <t>In the simplest case, the counter value is an unsigned integer that
        a node increments by one or more on each secured RPL transmission. The
        counter MAY represent a timestamp that has the following
        properties:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>The timestamp MUST be at least six octets long.</t>

            <t>The timestamp MUST be in 1024 Hz (binary millisecond)
            granularity.</t>

            <t>The timestamp start time MUST be January 1, 1970, 12:00:00AM
            UTC.</t>

            <t>If the counter represents a timestamp, the counter value
            MUST be a value computed as follows. Let T be the timestamp, S be
            the start time of the key in use, and E be the end time of the key
            in use. Both S and E are represented using the same three rules as the
            timestamp described above. If E &gt; T &lt; S, then the counter is
            invalid and a node MUST NOT generate a packet. Otherwise, the
            counter value is equal to T-S.</t>

            <t>If the counter represents such a timestamp, a node MAY set the
            'T' flag of the Security section of secured RPL packets.</t>

            <t>If the Counter field does not present such a timestamp, then a
            node MUST NOT set the 'T' flag.</t>

            <t>If a node does not have a local timestamp that satisfies the
            above requirements, it MUST ignore the 'T' flag.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>If a node supports such timestamps and it receives a message with
        the 'T' flag set, it MAY apply the temporal check on the received
        message described in <xref target="TemporalCheck"></xref>. If a node
        receives a message without the 'T' flag set, it MUST NOT apply this
        temporal check. A node's security policy MAY, for application reasons,
        include rejecting all messages without the 'T' flag set.</t>

        <t>The 'T' flag is present because many LLNs today already maintain
        global time synchronization at sub-millisecond granularity for
        security, application, and other reasons. Allowing RPL to leverage
        this existing functionality when present greatly simplifies solutions
        to some security problems, such as delay protection.</t>

      <section title="Transmission of Outgoing Packets">
        <t>Given an outgoing RPL control packet and the required security
        protection, this section describes how RPL generates the secured
        packet to transmit. It also describes the order of cryptographic
        operations to provide the required protection.</t>

        <t>The requirement for security protection and the level of security
        to be applied to an outgoing RPL packet shall be determined by the
        node's security policy database. The configuration of this security
        policy database for outgoing packet processing is implementation
        specific.</t>

        <t>Where secured RPL messages are to be transmitted, a RPL node MUST
        set the Security section (T, Sec, KIM, and LVL) in the outgoing RPL
        packet to describe the protection level and security settings that are
        applied (see <xref target="RPLSecurityFields"></xref>). The Security
        subfield bit of the RPL Message Code field MUST be set to indicate the
        secure RPL message.</t>

        <t>The counter value used in constructing the AES-128 CCM nonce (<xref
        target="CCMNonce"></xref>) to secure the outgoing packet MUST be an
        increment of the last counter transmitted to the particular
        destination address.</t>

        <t>Where security policy specifies the application of delay
        protection, the Timestamp counter used in constructing the CCM nonce
        to secure the outgoing packet MUST be incremented according to the
        rules in <xref target="SecurityCounter"></xref>. Where a Timestamp
        counter is applied (indicated with the 'T' flag set), the locally
        maintained Timestamp counter MUST be included as part of the transmitted
        secured RPL message.</t>

        <t>The cryptographic algorithm used in securing the outgoing packet
        shall be specified by the node's security policy database and MUST be
        indicated in the value of the Sec field set within the outgoing
        message.</t>

        <t>The security policy for the outgoing packet shall determine the
        applicable KIM and Key Identifier specifying the
        security key to be used for the cryptographic packet processing,
        including the optional use of signature keys (see <xref
        target="RPLSecurityFields"></xref>). The security policy will also
        specify the algorithm (Algorithm) and level of protection (Level) in
        the form of authentication or authentication and encryption, and
        potential use of signatures that shall apply to the outgoing
        packet.</t>

        <t>Where encryption is applied, a node MUST replace the original
        packet payload with that payload encrypted using the security
        protection, key, and CCM nonce specified in the Security section of
        the packet.</t>

        <t>All secured RPL messages include integrity protection. In
        conjunction with the security algorithm processing, a node derives
        either a MAC or signature that MUST be
        included as part of the outgoing secured RPL packet.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Reception of Incoming Packets">
        <t>This section describes the reception and processing of a secured
        RPL packet. Given an incoming secured RPL packet, where the Security
        subfield bit of the RPL Message Code field is set, this section
        describes how RPL generates an unencrypted variant of the packet and
        validates its integrity.</t>

        <t>The receiver uses the RPL security control fields to determine the
        necessary packet security processing. If the described level of
        security for the message type and originator is unknown or does not
        meet locally maintained security policies, a node MUST discard the
        packet without further processing, MAY raise a management alert, and
        MUST NOT send any messages in response. These policies can include
        security levels, keys used, source identifiers, or the lack of
        timestamp-based counters (as indicated by the 'T' flag). The
        configuration of the security policy database for incoming packet
        processing is out of scope for this specification (it may, for
        example, be defined through DIO Configuration or through out-of-band
        administrative router configuration).</t>

        <t>Where the message Security Level (LVL) indicates an encrypted RPL
        message, the node uses the key information identified through the KIM
        field as well as the CCM nonce as input to the message payload
        decryption processing. The CCM nonce shall be derived from the message
        Counter field and other received and locally maintained information
        (see <xref target="SecurityNonce"></xref>). The plaintext message
        contents shall be obtained by invoking the inverse cryptographic mode
        of operation specified by the Sec field of the received packet.</t>

        <t>The receiver shall use the CCM nonce and identified key information
        to check the integrity of the incoming packet. If the integrity check
        fails against the received MAC, a node
        MUST discard the packet.</t>

        <t>If the received message has an initialized (zero value) counter
        value and the receiver has an incoming counter currently maintained
        for the originator of the message, the receiver MUST initiate a
        counter resynchronization by sending a Consistency Check response
        message (see <xref target="ConsistencyCheck"></xref>) to the message
        source. The Consistency Check response message shall be protected with
        the current full outgoing counter maintained for the particular node
        address. That outgoing counter will be included within the security
        section of the message while the incoming counter will be included
        within the Consistency Check message payload.</t>

        <t>Based on the specified security policy, a node MAY apply replay
        protection for a received RPL message. The replay check SHOULD be
        performed before the authentication of the received packet. The
        counter, as obtained from the incoming packet, shall be compared against
        the watermark of the incoming counter maintained for the given
        origination node address. If the received message counter value is
        non-zero and less than the maintained incoming counter watermark, a
        potential packet replay is indicated and the node MUST discard the
        incoming packet.</t>

        <t>If delay protection is specified as part of the incoming packet
        security policy checks, the Timestamp counter is used to validate the
        timeliness of the received RPL message. If the incoming message
        Timestamp counter value indicates a message transmission time prior to
        the locally maintained transmission time counter for the originator
        address, a replay violation is indicated and the node MUST discard the
        incoming packet. If the received Timestamp counter value indicates a
        message transmission time that is earlier than the Current time less
        the acceptable packet delay, a delay violation is indicated and the
        node MUST discard the incoming packet.</t>

        <t>Once a message has been decrypted, where applicable, and has
        successfully passed its integrity check, replay check, and optionally delay-protection checks, the node can update its local security information,
        such as the source's expected counter value for replay comparison.</t>

        <t>A node MUST NOT update its security information on receipt of a
        message that fails security policy checks or other applied integrity,
        replay, or delay checks.</t>

        <section anchor="TemporalCheck" title="Timestamp Key Checks">
          <t>If the 'T' flag of a message is set and a node has a local
          timestamp that follows the requirements in <xref
          target="SecurityCounter"></xref>, then a node MAY check the temporal
          consistency of the message. The node computes the transmit time of
          the message by adding the counter value to the start time of the
          associated key. If this transmit time is past the end time of the
          key, the node MAY discard the message without further processing. If
          the transmit time is too far in the past or future compared to the
          local time on the receiver, it MAY discard the message without
          further processing.</t>

      <section title="Coverage of Integrity and Confidentiality">
        <t>For a RPL ICMPv6 message, the entire packet is within the scope of
        RPL security.</t>

        <t>MACs and signatures are calculated
        over the entire unsecured IPv6 packet. When computing MACs and
        signatures, mutable IPv6 fields are considered to be filled with
        zeroes, following the rules in Section 3.3.3.1 of <xref
        target="RFC4302"></xref> (IPsec Authenticated Header). MAC and
        signature calculations are performed before any compression that lower
        layers may apply.</t>

        <t>When a RPL ICMPv6 message is encrypted, encryption starts at the
        first byte after the Security section and continues to the last byte
        of the packet. The IPv6 header, ICMPv6 header, and RPL message up to
        the end of the Security section are not encrypted, as they are needed
        to correctly decrypt the packet.</t>

        <t>For example, a node sending a message with LVL=1, KIM=0, and
        Algorithm=0 uses the CCM algorithm <xref target="RFC3610"></xref> to
        create a packet with attributes ENC-MAC-32: it encrypts the packet and
        appends a 32-bit MAC. The block cipher key is determined by the Key
        Index. The CCM nonce is computed as described in <xref
        target="SecurityNonce"></xref>; the message to authenticate and
        encrypt is the RPL message starting at the first byte after the
        Security section and ends with the last byte of the packet. The
        additional authentication data starts with the beginning of the IPv6
        header and ends with the last byte of the RPL Security section.</t>

          <t>The signature scheme in RPL for Security Mode 3 is an
          instantiation of the RSA algorithm (RSASSA-PSS) as defined in
          Section 8.1 of <xref target="RFC3447"></xref>. As public key, it uses
          the pair (n,e), where n is a 2048&nbhy;bit or 3072-bit RSA modulus and
          where e=2^{16}+1. It uses CCM mode <xref target="RFC3610"></xref> as
          the encryption scheme with M=0 (as a stream-cipher). Note that
          although <xref target="RFC3610"></xref> disallows the CCM mode with
          M=0, RPL explicitly allows the CCM mode with M=0 when used in
          conjunction with a signature, because the signature provides
          sufficient data authentication. Here, the CCM mode with M=0 is
          specified as in <xref target="RFC3610"></xref>, but where the M'
          field in Section 2.2 MUST be set to 0. It uses the SHA-256 hash
          function specified in Section 6.2 of <xref target="FIPS180"></xref>.
          It uses the message encoding rules of Section 8.1 of <xref

          <t>Let 'a' be a concatenation of a 6-byte representation of
          counter and the message header. The packet payload is the
          right-concatenation of packet data 'm' and the signature 's'. This
          signature scheme is invoked with the right-concatenation of the
          message parts a and m, whereas the signature verification is invoked
          with the right-concatenation of the message parts a and m and with
          signature s.</t>

          <t>RSA signatures of this form provide sufficient protection for RPL
          networks. If needed, alternative signature schemes that produce
          more concise signatures is out of scope for this specification and
          may be the subject of a future specification.</t>

          <t>An implementation that supports RSA signing with either 2048-bit
          or 3072-bit signatures SHOULD support verification of both 2048-bit
          and 3072-bit RSA signatures. This is in consideration of providing

        <t>This document specifies a routing protocol. These non-normative
        suggestions are provided to aid in the design of a forwarding
        implementation by illustrating how such an implementation could work
        with RPL.</t>

        <t>When forwarding a packet to a destination, precedence is given to
        selection of a next-hop successor as follows:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>This specification only covers how a successor is selected from
            the DODAG Version that matches the RPLInstanceID marked in the
            IPv6 header of the packet being forwarded. Routing outside the
            instance can be done as long as additional rules are put in place
            such as strict ordering of instances and routing protocols to
            protect against loops. Such rules may be defined in a separate
            document.</t>

            <t>If a local administrative preference favors a route that has
            been learned from a different routing protocol than RPL, then use
            that successor.</t>

            <t>If the packet header specifies a source route by including an
            RH4 header as specified in <xref
            target="RFC6554"></xref>, then use that
            route. If the node fails to forward the packet with that specified
            source route, then that packet should be dropped. The node MAY log
            an error. The node may send an ICMPv6 error in Source Routing
            Header message to the source of the packet (see <xref
            target="ICMPv6ErrSrcRte"></xref>).</t>

            <t>If there is an entry in the routing table matching the
            destination that has been learned from a multicast destination
            advertisement (e.g., the destination is a one-hop neighbor), then
            use that successor.</t>

            <t>If there is an entry in the routing table matching the
            destination that has been learned from a unicast destination
            advertisement (e.g., the destination is located Down the
            sub-DODAG), then use that successor. If there are DAO Path Control
            bits associated with multiple successors, then consult the Path
            Control bits to order the successors by preference when choosing.

        <t>RPL loop avoidance mechanisms are kept simple and designed to
        minimize churn and states. Loops may form for a number of reasons,
        e.g., control packet loss. RPL includes a reactive loop detection
        technique that protects from meltdown and triggers repair of broken
        paths.</t>

        <t>RPL loop detection uses RPL Packet Information that is transported
        within the data packets, relying on an external mechanism such as

            RPLInstanceID is part of the RPL Packet Information.</t>

            <t>A RPL router that forwards a packet in the RPL network MUST
            check if the packet includes the RPL Packet Information. If not,

            <t>When the DODAG root increments the DODAGVersionNumber, a
            temporary Rank discontinuity may form between the next DODAG
            Version and the prior DODAG Version, in particular, if nodes are
            adjusting their Rank in the next DODAG Version and deferring their
            migration into the next DODAG Version. A router that is still a
            member of the prior DODAG Version may choose to forward a packet
            to a (future) parent that is in the next DODAG Version. In some
            cases, this could cause the parent to detect an inconsistency
            because the Rank-ordering in the prior DODAG Version is not
            necessarily the same as in the next DODAG Version, and the packet
            may be judged not to be making forward progress. If the sending
            router is aware that the chosen successor has already joined the
            next DODAG Version, then the sending router MUST update the
            SenderRank to INFINITE_RANK as it forwards the packets across the
            discontinuity into the next DODAG Version in order to avoid a
            false detection of Rank inconsistency.</t>

            <t>One inconsistency along the path is not considered a critical
            error and the packet may continue. However, a second detection along
            the path of the same packet should not occur and the packet MUST be
            dropped.</t>

            <t>This process is controlled by the Rank-Error bit associated
            with the packet. When an inconsistency is detected on a packet, if
            the Rank-Error bit was not set, then the Rank-Error bit is set. If

                   title="DAO Inconsistency Detection and Recovery">
            <t>DAO inconsistency loop recovery is a mechanism that applies to
            Storing mode of operation only.</t>

            <t>In Non-Storing mode, the packets are source routed to the
            destination, and DAO inconsistencies are not corrected locally.
            Instead, an ICMP error with a new code "Error in Source Routing
            Header" is sent back to the root. The "Error in Source Routing
            Header" message has the same format as the "Destination
            Unreachable Message", as specified in <xref
            target="RFC4443"></xref>. The portion of the invoking packet that
            is sent back in the ICMP message should record at least up to the
            routing header, and the routing header should be consumed by this
            node so that the destination in the IPv6 header is the next hop
            that this node could not reach.</t>

            <t>A DAO inconsistency happens when a router has a Downward route
            that was previously learned from a DAO message via a child, but
            that Downward route is not longer valid in the child, e.g., because
            that related state in the child has been cleaned up. With DAO
            inconsistency loop recovery, a packet can be used to recursively
            explore and clean up the obsolete DAO states along a sub-DODAG.</t>

            <t>In a general manner, a packet that goes Down should never go Up
            again. If DAO inconsistency loop recovery is applied, then the
            router SHOULD send the packet back to the parent that passed it
            with the Forwarding-Error 'F' bit set and the 'O' bit left
            untouched. Otherwise, the router MUST silently discard the
            packet.</t>

            <t>Upon receiving a packet with a Forwarding-Error bit set, the
            node MUST remove the routing states that caused forwarding to that
            neighbor, clear the Forwarding-Error bit, and attempt to send the
            packet again. The packet may be sent to an alternate neighbor,
            after the expiration of a user-configurable implementation-specific timer. If that alternate neighbor still has an
            inconsistent DAO state via this node, the process will recurse,
            this node will set the Forwarding-Error 'F' bit, and the routing
            state in the alternate neighbor will be cleaned up as well.</t>

    <section anchor="MulticastOperation" title="Multicast Operation">
      <t>This section describes a multicast routing operation over an IPv6 RPL
  network and, specifically, how unicast DAOs can be used to relay group
  registrations.  The same DODAG construct can be used to forward unicast
  and multicast traffic. This section is limited to a description of how
  group registrations may be exchanged and how the forwarding
  infrastructure operates. It does not provide a full description of
  multicast within an LLN and, in particular, does not describe the
  generation of DODAGs specifically targeted at multicast or the
  details of operating RPL for multicast -- that will be the subject of
  further specifications.</t>
 
<t>  The multicast group registration uses DAO messages that are identical
  to unicast except for the type of address that is transported.  The
  main difference is that the multicast traffic going down is copied to
  all the children that have registered with the multicast group, whereas
  unicast traffic is passed to one child only.</t>

      <t>Nodes that support the RPL Storing mode of operation SHOULD also
      support multicast DAO operations as described below. Nodes that only
      support the Non-Storing mode of operation are not expected to support
      this section.</t>

      <t>The multicast operation is controlled by the MOP field in the DIO.
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>If the MOP field requires multicast support, then a node that
          joins the RPL network as a router must operate as described in this
          section for multicast signaling and forwarding within the RPL
          network. A node that does not support the multicast operation
          required by the MOP field can only join as a leaf.</t>

          <t>If the MOP field does not require multicast support, then
          multicast is handled by some other way that is out of scope for this
          specification. (Examples may include a series of unicast copies or
          limited-scope flooding).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>A router might select to pass a listener registration DAO message to
      its preferred parent only; in which case, multicast packets coming back
      might be lost for all of its sub-DODAGs if the transmission fails over
      that link. Alternatively, the router might select copying additional
      parents as it would do for DAO messages advertising unicast
      destinations; in which case, there might be duplicates that the router
      will need to prune.</t>

      <t>As a result, multicast routing states are installed in each router on
      the way from the listeners to the DODAG root, enabling the root to copy
      a multicast packet to all its children routers that had issued a DAO
      message including a Target option for that multicast group.</t>

      <t>For a multicast packet sourced from inside the DODAG, the packet is
      passed to the preferred parents, and if that fails, then to the
      alternates in the DODAG. The packet is also copied to all the registered
      children, except for the one that passed the packet. Finally, if there
      is a listener in the external infrastructure, then the DODAG root has to
      further propagate the packet into the external infrastructure.</t>

      <t>As a result, the DODAG root acts as an automatic proxy Rendezvous
      Point for the RPL network and as source towards the non-RPL domain for
      all multicast flows started in the RPL domain. So, regardless of whether
      the root is actually attached to a non-RPL domain, and regardless of
      whether the DODAG is grounded or floating, the root can serve inner
      multicast streams at all times.</t>

    <section anchor="MaintenanceRoutingAdjacency"
             title="Maintenance of Routing Adjacency">
      <t>The selection of successors, along the default paths Up along the
      DODAG, or along the paths learned from destination advertisements Down
      along the DODAG, leads to the formation of routing adjacencies that
      require maintenance.</t>

      <t>In IGPs, such as OSPF <xref target="RFC4915"></xref> or IS-IS <xref
      target="RFC5120"></xref>, the maintenance of a routing adjacency
      involves the use of keepalive mechanisms (Hellos) or other protocols
      such as the <xref target="RFC5881"> Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
      </xref>  and the MANET <xref target="RFC6130">
      Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)</xref>. Unfortunately, such a
      proactive approach is often not desirable in constrained environments
      where it would lead to excessive control traffic in light of the data
      traffic with a negative impact on both link loads and nodes
      resources.</t>

      <t>By contrast with those routing protocols, RPL does not define any
      keepalive mechanisms to detect routing adjacency failures: this is
      because in many cases, such a mechanism would be too expensive in terms
      of bandwidth and, even more importantly, energy (a battery-operated device
      could not afford to send periodic keepalives). Still RPL requires an
      external mechanisms to detect that a neighbor is no longer reachable.
      Such a mechanism should preferably be reactive to traffic in order to
      minimize the overhead to maintain the routing adjacency and focus on
      links that are actually being used.</t>

      <t>Example reactive mechanisms that can be used include: <list>
          <t>The <xref target="RFC4861"> Neighbor Unreachability Detection
          </xref> mechanism.</t>

    <section anchor="OFGuide" title="Guidelines for Objective Functions">
      <t>An Objective Function (OF), in conjunction with routing metrics and
      constraints, allows for the selection of a DODAG to join, and a number
      of peers in that DODAG as parents. The OF is used to compute an ordered
      list of parents. The OF is also responsible to compute the Rank of the
      device within the DODAG Version.</t>

      <t>The Objective Function is indicated in the DIO message using an
      Objective Code Point (OCP), and it indicates the method that must be used
      to construct the DODAG. The Objective Code Points are specified in <xref
      target="RFC6552"></xref> and related companion
      specifications.</t>

      <section title="Objective Function Behavior">
        <t>Most Objective Functions are expected to follow the same abstract
        behavior at a node: <list style="symbols">
            <t>The parent selection is triggered each time an event indicates
            that a potential next-hop information is updated. This might
            happen upon the reception of a DIO message, a timer elapse, all
            DODAG parents are unavailable, or a trigger indicating that the
            state of a candidate neighbor has changed.</t>

            <t>An OF scans all the interfaces on the node. Although, there may
            typically be only one interface in most application scenarios,
            there might be multiple of them and an interface might be
            configured to be usable or not for RPL operation. An interface can
            also be configured with a preference or dynamically learned to be
            better than another by some heuristics that might be link-layer
            dependent and are out of scope for this specification. Finally, an
            interface might or might not match a required criterion for an Objective
            Function, for instance, a degree of security. As a result, some
            interfaces might be completely excluded from the computation, for
            example, if those interfaces cannot satisfy some advertised
            constraints, while others might be more or less preferred.</t>

            <t>An OF scans all the candidate neighbors on the possible
            interfaces to check whether they can act as a router for a DODAG.
            There might be many of them and a candidate neighbor might
            need to pass some validation tests before it can be used. In
            particular, some link layers require experience on the activity
            with a router to enable the router as a next hop.</t>

            <t>An OF computes Rank of a node for comparison by adding to the
            Rank of the candidate a value representing the relative locations
            of the node and the candidate in the DODAG Version.<list

                <t>To keep loop avoidance and metric optimization in
                alignment, the increase in Rank should reflect any increase in
                the metric value. For example, with a purely additive metric,
                such as ETX, the increase in Rank can be made proportional to
                the increase in the metric.</t>

            current best parent and compares its capabilities with the current
            candidate neighbor. The OF defines a number of tests that are
            critical to reach the objective. A test between the routers

      <t>This specification directly borrows the Prefix Information Option
      (PIO) and the Route Information Option (RIO) from IPv6 ND. It is
      envisioned that, as future specifications build on this base, there may
      be additional cause to leverage parts of IPv6 ND. This section provides
      some suggestions for future specifications.</t>

      <t>First and foremost, RPL is a routing protocol. One should take great
      care to preserve architecture when mapping functionalities between RPL
      and ND. RPL is for routing only. That said, there may be persuading
      technical reasons to allow for sharing options between RPL and IPv6 ND
      in a particular implementation/deployment.</t>

      <t>In general, the following guidelines apply: <list style="symbols">
          <t>RPL Type codes must be allocated from the RPL Control Message
          options registry.</t>

          <t>RPL Length fields must be expressed in units of single octets, as
          opposed to ND Length fields, which are expressed in units of 8 octets.</t>

          <t>RPL options are generally not required to be aligned to 8-octet
          boundaries.</t>

             title="Summary of Requirements for Interoperable Implementations">
      <t>This section summarizes basic interoperability and references
      normative text for RPL implementations operating in one of three major
      modes. Implementations are expected to support either no Downward
      routes, Non-Storing mode only, or Storing mode only. A fourth mode,
      operation as a leaf, is also possible.</t>

      <t>Implementations conforming to this specification may contain
      different subsets of capabilities as appropriate to the application
      scenario. It is important for the implementer to support a level of
      interoperability consistent with that required by the application
      scenario. To this end, further guidance may be provided beyond this
      specification (e.g., as applicability statements), and it is understood
      that in some cases such further guidance may override portions of this
      specification.</t>

      <section title="Common Requirements">
        <t>In a general case, the greatest level of interoperability may be
        achieved when all of the nodes in a RPL LLN are cooperating to use the
        same MOP, OF, metrics, and constraints, and are thus able to act as
        RPL routers. When a node is not capable of being a RPL router, it may be
        possible to interoperate in a more limited manner as a RPL leaf.</t>

        <t>All RPL implementations need to support the use of RPL Packet
        Information transported within data packets (<xref
        target="loopdetect"></xref>). One such mechanism is described in <xref
        target="RFC6553"></xref>.</t>

        <t>RPL implementations will need to support the use of Neighbor
        Unreachability Detection (NUD), or an equivalent mechanism, to
        maintain the reachability of neighboring RPL nodes (<xref
        target="parentset"></xref>). Alternate mechanisms may be optimized to
        the constrained capabilities of the implementation, such as hints from
        the link layer.</t>

        <t>This specification provides means to obtain a PIO and thus form an
        IPv6 address. When that mechanism is used, it may be necessary to
        perform address resolution and duplicate address detection through an
        external process, such as IPv6 ND <xref target="RFC4861"></xref> or
        6LoWPAN ND <xref target="6LOWPAN-ND"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="Manageability" title="Manageability Considerations">
      <t>The aim of this section is to give consideration to the manageability
      of RPL, and how RPL will be operated in an LLN. The scope of this section
      is to consider the following aspects of manageability: configuration,
      monitoring, fault management, accounting, and performance of the
      protocol in light of the recommendations set forth in <xref
      target="RFC5706"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="Introduction">
        <t>Most of the existing IETF management standards are MIB modules
(data models based on the Structure of
        Management Information (SMI)) to
        monitor and manage networking devices.</t>

        <t>For a number of protocols, the IETF community has used the IETF
        Standard Management Framework, including the Simple Network Management
        Protocol <xref target="RFC3410"></xref>, the Structure of Management
        Information <xref target="RFC2578"></xref>, and MIB data models for
        managing new protocols.</t>

        <t>As pointed out in <xref target="RFC5706"></xref>, the common policy
        in terms of operation and management has been expanded to a policy
        that is more open to a set of tools and management protocols rather
        than strictly relying on a single protocol such as SNMP.</t>

        <t>In 2003, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a workshop on
        Network Management <xref target="RFC3535"></xref> that discussed the
        strengths and weaknesses of some IETF network management protocols and
        compared them to operational needs, especially configuration.</t>

        <t>One issue discussed was the user-unfriendliness of the binary
        format of SNMP <xref target="RFC3410"></xref>. In the case of LLNs, it
        must be noted that at the time of writing, the CoRE working group is
        actively working on resource management of devices in LLNs. Still, it
        is felt that this section provides important guidance on how RPL
        should be deployed, operated, and managed.</t>

        <t>As stated in <xref target="RFC5706"></xref>:</t>
<t><list style="empty"><t> A management
        information model should include a discussion of what is manageable,
        which aspects of the protocol need to be configured, what types of
        operations are allowed, what protocol-specific events might occur,
        which events can be counted, and for which events an operator should
        be notified. </t></list></t>

<t>These aspects are discussed in detail in the following
        sections.</t>

        <t>RPL will be used on a variety of devices that may have resources
        such as memory varying from a few kilobytes to several hundreds of kilobytes
        and even megabytes. When memory is highly constrained, it may not be
        possible to satisfy all the requirements listed in this section. Still
        it is worth listing all of these in an exhaustive fashion, and
        implementers will then determine which of these requirements could be
        satisfied according to the available resources on the device.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Configuration Management">
        <t>This section discusses the configuration management, listing the
        protocol parameters for which configuration management is
        relevant.</t>

        <t>Some of the RPL parameters are optional. The requirements for
        configuration are only applicable for the options that are used.</t>

        <section title="Initialization Mode">
          <t>"Architectural Principles of the Internet" <xref
          target="RFC1958"></xref>, Section 3.8, states: "Avoid options and
          parameters whenever possible. Any options and parameters should be
          configured or negotiated dynamically rather than manually".  This is
          especially true in LLNs where the number of devices may be large and
          manual configuration is infeasible. This has been taken into account
          in the design of RPL whereby the DODAG root provides a number of
          parameters to the devices joining the DODAG, thus avoiding
          cumbersome configuration on the routers and potential sources of
          misconfiguration (e.g., values of Trickle timers, etc.). Still, there
          are additional RPL parameters that a RPL implementation should allow
          to be configured, which are discussed in this section.</t>

          <section title="DIS Mode of Operation upon Boot-Up">
            <t>When a node is first powered up:<list style="numbers">
                <t>The node may decide to stay silent, waiting to receive DIO
                messages from DODAG of interest (advertising a supported OF
                and metrics/constraints) and not send any multicast DIO
                messages until it has joined a DODAG.</t>

                <t>The node may decide to send one or more DIS messages
                (optionally, requesting DIO for a specific DODAG) as an initial
                probe for nearby DODAGs, and in the absence of DIO messages in
                reply after some configurable period of time, the node may
                decide to root a floating DODAG and start sending multicast
                DIO messages.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>A RPL implementation SHOULD allow configuring the preferred
            mode of operation listed above along with the required parameters

          number of the default values can be used, and when required these

          (prioritization, etc.). Such processing rules are out of scope for
          this specification. When used, a RPL implementation SHOULD allow
          configuring the Target Descriptor on a per-Target basis (for example,
          using access lists).</t>

          <t>A node whose DODAG parent set is empty may become the DODAG root
          of a floating DODAG. It may also set its DAGPreference such that it
          is less preferred. Thus, a RPL implementation MUST allow configuring
          the set of actions that the node should initiate in this case:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>Start its own (floating) DODAG: the new DODAGID must be
              configured in addition to its DAGPreference.</t>

              <t>Poison the broken path (see procedure in <xref

          <t>In addition, a RPL implementation SHOULD allow for configuring

          <t>DAG root behavior: in some cases, a node may not want to
          permanently act as a floating DODAG root if it cannot join a
          grounded DODAG. For example, a battery-operated node may not want to
          act as a floating DODAG root for a long period of time. Thus, a RPL
          implementation MAY support the ability to configure whether or not a

          time.</t>

          <t>DAG Version Number Increment: a RPL implementation may allow, by
          configuration at the DODAG root, refreshing the DODAG states by
          updating the DODAGVersionNumber. A RPL implementation SHOULD allow
          configuring whether or not periodic or event triggered mechanisms
          are used by the DODAG root to control DODAGVersionNumber change
          (which triggers a global repair as specified in <xref

        <section title="Configuration of RPL Parameters Related to DAO-Based Mechanisms">
          <t>DAO messages are optional and used in DODAGs that require

          <t>As stated in <xref target="ScheduleDAO"></xref>, it is
          recommended to delay the sending of DAO message to DAO parents in
          order to maximize the chances to perform route aggregation. Upon
          receiving a DAO message, the node should thus start a DelayDAO
          timer. The default value is DEFAULT_DAO_DELAY. A RPL implementation
          MAY allow for configuring the DelayDAO timer.</t>

          <t>In a Storing mode of operation, a storing node may increment DTSN
          in order to reliably trigger a set of DAO updates from its immediate
          children, as part of routine routing table updates and maintenance.
          A RPL implementation MAY allow for configuring a set of rules
          specifying the triggers for DTSN increment (manual or
          event-based).</t>

          <t>When a DAO entry times out or is invalidated, a node SHOULD make
          a reasonable attempt to report a No-Path to each of the DAO parents.
          That number of attempts MAY be configurable.</t>

          <t>An implementation should support rate-limiting the sending of DAO
          messages. The related parameters MAY be configurable.</t>

          is expected to be used in a number of contexts where network
          characteristics such as the number of nodes and link and node types
          are expected to vary significantly. Thus, these default values are
          likely to change with the context and as the technology evolves.
          Indeed, LLNs' related technology (e.g., hardware, link layers) have
          been evolving dramatically over the past few years and such

        advertised by a neighbor by means of DIO messages.</t>

        <t>This document specifies operation within a single DODAG. A DODAG is
        characterized by the following tuple (RPLInstanceID, DODAGID).
        Furthermore, as pointed out above, DIO messages are used to advertise
        other DODAG characteristics such as the routing metrics and
        constraints used to build to the DODAG and the Objective Function in
        use (specified by OCP).</t>

        <t>The first policy rules consist of specifying the following
        conditions that a RPL node must satisfy to join a DODAG:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">

          </list></t>

        <t>A RPL implementation MUST allow configuring these parameters and
        SHOULD specify whether the node must simply ignore the DIO if the
        advertised DODAG is not compliant with the local policy or whether the
        node should join as the leaf node if only the list of supported
        routing metrics and constraints, and the OF is not supported.
        Additionally, a RPL implementation SHOULD allow for the addition of the
        DODAGID as part of the policy.</t>

        <t>A RPL implementation SHOULD allow configuring the set of acceptable
        or preferred Objective Functions (OFs) referenced by their Objective
        Code Points (OCPs) for a node to join a DODAG, and what action should
        be taken if none of a node's candidate neighbors advertise one of the
        configured allowable Objective Functions, or if the advertised
        metrics/constraint is not understood/supported. Two actions can be
        taken in this case:</t>

        preference for the routing protocol from which the route was
        learned.</t>

        <t>Internal Data Structures: some RPL implementations may limit the
        size of the candidate neighbor list in order to bound the memory
        usage; in which case, some otherwise viable candidate neighbors may not
        be considered and simply dropped from the candidate neighbor list.</t>

        <t>RPL has very limited impact on other protocols. Where more than one
        routing protocol is required on a router, such as an LBR, it is expected

        routing protocols to allow for reachability between the two routing
        domains. Such redistribution SHOULD be governed by the use of user
        configurable policy.</t>

        <t>With regard to the impact in terms of traffic on the network, RPL
        has been designed to limit the control traffic thanks to mechanisms
        such as Trickle timers (<xref target="DIOTransmission"></xref>). Thus,
        the impact of RPL on other protocols should be extremely limited.</t>

      <section title="Performance Management">
        <t>Performance management is always an important aspect of a protocol,
        and RPL is not an exception. Several metrics of interest have been
        specified by the IP Performance Monitoring (IPPM) working group: that
        being said, they will be hardly applicable to LLN considering the cost
        of monitoring these metrics in terms of resources on the devices and
        required bandwidth. Still, RPL implementations MAY support some of
        these, and other parameters of interest are listed below:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Number of repairs and time to repair in seconds (average,
            variance)</t>

            <t>Number of times and time period during which a devices could not
            forward a packet because of a lack of a reachable neighbor in its
            routing table</t>

            <t>Monitoring of resources consumption by RPL in terms of
            bandwidth and required memory</t>

            <t>Number of RPL control messages sent and received</t>

      <section title="Diagnostics">
        <t>There may be situations where a node should be placed in "verbose"
        mode to improve diagnostics. Thus, a RPL implementation SHOULD provide
        the ability to place a node in and out of verbose mode in order to get
        additional diagnostic information.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <section title="Overview">
        <t>From a security perspective, RPL networks are no different from any
        other network. They are vulnerable to passive eavesdropping attacks
        and, potentially, even active tampering when physical access to a wire
        is not required to participate in communications. The very nature of
        ad hoc networks and their cost objectives impose additional security
        constraints, which perhaps make these networks the most difficult
        environments to secure. Devices are low-cost and have limited
        capabilities in terms of computing power, available storage, and power
        drain; it cannot always be assumed they have a trusted computing
        base or a high-quality random number generator aboard. Communications
        cannot rely on the online availability of a fixed infrastructure and
        might involve short-term relationships between devices that may never
        have communicated before. These constraints might severely limit the
        choice of cryptographic algorithms and protocols and influence the
        design of the security architecture because the establishment and
        maintenance of trust relationships between devices need to be
        addressed with care. In addition, battery lifetime and cost
        constraints put severe limits on the security overhead these networks
        can tolerate, something that is of far less concern with higher
        bandwidth networks. Most of these security architectural elements can
        be implemented at higher layers and may, therefore, be considered to
        be out of scope for this specification. Special care, however, needs
        to be exercised with respect to interfaces to these higher layers.</t>

        <t>The security mechanisms in this standard are based on symmetric-key
        and public-key cryptography and use keys that are to be provided by
        higher-layer processes. The establishment and maintenance of these
        keys are out of scope for this specification. The mechanisms assume a
        secure implementation of cryptographic operations and secure and
        authentic storage of keying material.</t>

        <t>The security mechanisms specified provide particular combinations
        of the following security services:</t>

        <t><list hangIndent="24" style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Data confidentiality:">Assurance that transmitted
            information is only disclosed to parties for which it is
            intended.</t>

            <t hangText="Data authenticity:">Assurance of the source of
            transmitted information (and, hereby, that information was not
            modified in transit).</t>

            <t hangText="Replay protection:">Assurance that a duplicate of
            transmitted information is detected.</t>

            <t hangText="Timeliness (delay protection):">Assurance that
            transmitted information was received in a timely manner.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The actual protection provided can be adapted on a per-packet basis
        and allows for varying levels of data authenticity (to minimize
        security overhead in transmitted packets where required) and for
        optional data confidentiality. When nontrivial protection is required,
        replay protection is always provided.</t>

        <t>Replay protection is provided via the use of a non-repeating value
        (CCM nonce) in the packet protection process and storage of some
        status information (originating device and the CCM nonce counter last
        received from that device), which allows detection of whether this
        particular CCM nonce value was used previously by the originating
        device. In addition, so-called delay protection is provided amongst
        those devices that have a loosely synchronized clock on board. The
        acceptable time delay can be adapted on a per-packet basis and allows
        for varying latencies (to facilitate longer latencies in packets
        transmitted over a multi-hop communication path).</t>

        <t>Cryptographic protection may use a key shared between two peer
        devices (link key) or a key shared among a group of devices (group
        key), thus allowing some flexibility and application-specific
        trade-offs between key storage and key maintenance costs versus the
        cryptographic protection provided. If a group key is used for
        peer-to-peer communication, protection is provided only against
        outsider devices and not against potential malicious devices in the
        key-sharing group.</t>

        <t>Data authenticity may be provided using symmetric-key-based or
        public-key-based techniques. With public-key-based techniques (via
        signatures), one corroborates evidence as to the unique originator of
        transmitted information, whereas with symmetric-key-based techniques,
        data authenticity is only provided relative to devices in a
        key-sharing group. Thus, public-key-based authentication may be useful
        in scenarios that require a more fine-grained authentication than can
        be provided with symmetric-key-based authentication techniques alone,
        such as with group communications (broadcast, multicast) or in
        scenarios that require non-repudiation.</t>

<abstract><t>In Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), memory constraints on routers may limit them to maintaining at most a few routes.  In some configurations, it is necessary to use these memory constrained routers to deliver datagrams to nodes within the LLN.  The Routing for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) protocol can be used in some deployments to store most, if not all, routes on one (e.g. the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) root) or few routers and forward the IPv6 datagram using a source routing technique to avoid large routing tables on memory constrained routers.  This document specifies a new IPv6 Routing header type for delivering datagrams within a RPL Instance.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>The IETF 6LoWPAN working group defines IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Networks such as IEEE 802.15.4.  This and other similar link technologies have limited or no usage of multicast signaling due to energy conservation.  In addition, the wireless network may not strictly follow traditional concept of IP subnets and IP links.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery was not designed for non-transitive wireless links.  The traditional IPv6 link concept and heavy use of multicast make the protocol inefficient and sometimes impractical in a low power and lossy network.  This document describes simple optimizations to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, addressing mechanisms and duplicate address detection for 6LoWPAN and similar networks.  The document, thus updates RFC 4944 to specify the use of the optimizations defined here.</t></abstract>

      schemes supported by information distributed within RPL. However, if an
      implementation includes another address autoconfiguration scheme, RPL
      nodes might be configured not to set the 'A' flag in PIO options, though
      the PIO can still be used to distribute prefix and addressing
      information.</t>

        <t><xref target="FigureCase1"></xref> illustrates the logical
        addressing architecture of a simple RPL network operating in Storing
        mode. In this example, each Node, A, B, C, and D, owns its own prefix
        and makes that prefix available for address autoconfiguration by
        on-link devices. (This is conveyed by setting the 'A' flag and the 'L'
        flag in the PIO of the DIO messages). Node A owns the prefix A::/64,
        Node B owns B::/64, and so on. Node B autoconfigures an on-link
        address with respect to Node A, A::B. &nbsp;Nodes C and D similarly
        autoconfigure on-link addresses from Node B's prefix, B::C and B::D,
        respectively. Nodes have the option of setting the 'R' flag and
        publishing their address within the Prefix field of the PIO.</t>

        <t><xref target="FigureCase3"></xref> illustrates the logical
        addressing architecture of a simple RPL network operating in
        Non-Storing mode. In this example, each Node, A, B, C, and D, owns its
        own prefix, and makes that prefix available for address
        autoconfiguration by on-link devices. (This is conveyed by setting the
        'A' flag and the 'L' flag in the PIO of the DIO messages.) Node A owns
        the prefix A::/64, Node B owns B::/64, and so on. Node B
        autoconfigures an on-link address with respect to Node A, A::B. &nbsp;Nodes
        C and D similarly autoconfigure on-link addresses from Node B's
        prefix, B::C and B::D, respectively. Nodes have the option of setting
        the 'R' flag and publishing their address within the Prefix field of
        the PIO.</t>

        <t>Consider the simple network illustrated in <xref

        routers participating in a RPL network: a DODAG root, Nodes A, Y, and
        Z. &nbsp;The DODAG root and Node Z also have connectivity to different
        external network domains (i.e., external to the RPL network). Note that
        those external networks could be RPL networks or another type of

        <t>In this example, the DODAG root makes a prefix available to the RPL
        subnet for address autoconfiguration. Here, the entire RPL subnet uses
        that same prefix, RPL::/64, for address autoconfiguration, though in
        other implementations more complex/hybrid schemes could be
        employed.</t>

        <t>The DODAG root has connectivity to an external (with respect to
        that RPL network) prefix EXT_1::/64. The DODAG root may have learned
        of connectivity to this prefix, for example, via explicit
        configuration or IPv6 ND on a non-RPL interface. The DODAG root is
        configured to announce information on the connectivity to this
        prefix.</t>

        <t>Similarly, Node Z has connectivity to an external prefix
        EXT_2::/64. Node Z also has a sub-DODAG underneath of it.</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>The DODAG root adds a RIO to its DIO messages. The RIO contains
            the external prefix EXT_1::/64. This information may be repeated
            in the DIO messages emitted by the other nodes within the DODAG.
            Thus, the reachability to the prefix EXT_1::/64 is disseminated
            down the DODAG.</t>

            <t>Node Z may advertise reachability to the Target network
            EXT_2::/64 by sending DAO messages using EXT_2::/64 as a Target in
            the Target option and itself (Node Z) as a parent in the Transit
            Information option. (In Storing mode, that Transit Information
            option does not need to contain the address of Node Z). A
            non-storing root then becomes aware of the 1-hop link (Node Z --
            EXT_2::/64) for use in constructing source routes. Node Z may
            additionally advertise its reachability to EXT_2::/64 to nodes in
            its sub-DODAG by sending DIO messages with a PIO, with the 'A'
            flag cleared.</t>
