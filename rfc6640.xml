    <abstract>
      <t>This document attempts to provide a list of the frequently
      asked questions (FAQs) posed by IETF meeting attendees regarding
      travel logistics and local information. It is intended to assist those
      who are willing to provide local information, so that if they wish to
      pre-populate answers to some or all of these questions either in the
      IETF wiki or a meeting-specific site, they have a reasonably complete
      list of ideas to draw from. It is not meant as a list of required
      information that the host or Secretariat needs to provide; it merely
serves as a
      guideline.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IETF attendees come from all over the world. The typical IETF meeting
      has representatives from over 50 countries. It is quite likely
      that a large portion of the participants in any given IETF are newcomers
      to the specific location where it is being held or even to the country or
      region itself. As a result, they are going to have questions regarding
      their personal travel needs and logistics that may only be
      answerable by someone who has been to the area before, someone
      who lives there, and/or someone who speaks the local language.</t>

      <t>The IETF, the Secretariat, and any local host organizations
      responsible for the logistics of making IETF meetings happen are not
      travel agencies, but they often can and do assist with identifying and
      hosting the common information that most attendees wish to have while
      they are planning their trip. This document attempts to cover the most
      commonly asked questions and categories for information. This document
      is not intended to provide answers to these questions for every possible
      location in which IETF meetings may be held. Rather, it is intended to
      provide a set of FAQs for use by the hosts and others who have
      experience with the area where the event is being held, so that
      questions and answers can be handled efficiently, rather than waiting until
      someone sends an email to the meeting attendees mailing list in the days
      leading up to the meeting.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Why is this document necessary?">
      <t>In reading this document, one may ask, "Isn't that why search engines
      and travel sites exist?" Although we can sometimes
      find what we're looking for with search engines, that results in
      hundreds of people spending time searching, which is not very
      efficient. In addition, despite the widely held belief that if it is
      published on the Internet, it must be true, sometimes the information
      that is available is either inaccurate, incomplete, or out of date, so
      it may be less reliable than firsthand information from someone who has been
      there. Also, no matter how much online translation has improved, some of
      the most useful local travel sites may be difficult for
      non-native speakers to navigate and find information, because navigation
      buttons, graphics, and other active content are typically not
      machine-translatable, and non-native speakers may not realize when
      machine translation is inaccurate in a critical way. Lastly, while the
      companies that serve as hosts for IETF meetings often have participants
      attending IETF, the folks who are responsible for handling the details
      of hosting an IETF may not be regular attendees. Therefore, this
      document, especially <xref target="helpfulinfo"/>, is intended to be something that can be
      provided to host event organizers that may not have much familiarity
      with the IETF, so that they have a better sense of the information that
      attendees will find helpful.</t>

      <t>The format of this document was chosen so that it captures the
      FAQs, but usually not their answers. This is
      because IETF RFCs are typically static and infrequently updated, which
      does not make them a particularly suitable format to contain
      location-specific information. The questions found in this document are
      a result of informal review of the attendees mailing
      lists from past meetings and feedback from many individuals; they are believed to be
      reasonably static from one meeting to the next. This document is not
      necessarily all-inclusive, but it should serve as a reasonable baseline
      such that a static format like an RFC is appropriate. It is likely that
      this RFC will need to be revised periodically -- a clue that this is
      necessary will be when, over the course of multiple meetings, multiple
      additional questions that are not covered by this document repeatedly surface on
      the attendees mailing list and thus become FAQs.</t>

      <t>The answers to this document's questions are expected to be stored in
      a location that is easily updated by multiple parties, so that
      site-specific information can be refined and updated as often as
      necessary, thereby creating a living document. There are several options
      as to where to store this location-specific living document. 
For some past IETF meetings, the hosting organization or an individual
<xref target="HIROSHIMA"></xref> has set up a special website. The best recent examples of these, in
terms of the information provided, are www.ietf75.se and
ietf71.comcast.net. Unfortunately, these types of sites are not maintained
indefinitely once the IETF meeting for which they were set up has concluded, so
the only way to review them as examples is to use the Internet Wayback Machine
<xref target="WEBARCHIVE"></xref>.
Such a website has been a
      source of much additional information about the location and is always
      quite helpful. If the host decides to set up a site like this, the hope
      is that this document will provide guidance as to the type of
      information with which to populate such a site. However, it is by no
      means a requirement that the host set up an external website. Further,
      not every IETF meeting has a local host, or even a host at all. In these
      cases, the need for the same set of information is not lessened, but the
      IETF will be more reliant on the willingness of those with experience in
      the area where the meeting will be held to share the benefit of that
      experience with others. The IETF has provided a hosted <xref
      target="WIKI">wiki</xref> that can simply be populated with the same
      sorts of information. This has the added benefit of having a single
      location where additional information can be provided by experienced
      travelers, locals, and host representatives alike; it is therefore not
      completely reliant on the host. In the case where the IETF-hosted wiki
      is to be used, this document may serve as a framework of categories that
      could be pre-built when the site-specific page is set up, so that others
      can begin populating the information.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Helpful Information" anchor="helpfulinfo">
      <t>There are a number of general categories of information listed below.
      Some sections, such as Sections <xref target="travel" format="counter" />
and <xref target="regintconsid" format="counter" />, contain information necessary for travel; the
      rest can be considered nice to have. All of it comes from actual
      FAQs from the attendees mailing lists.</t>

      <t>Much of the needed information may already be available in another
      form online. There is no need to reproduce information that can be found
      on external websites, so simply providing pointers to information
      already available in other locations is quite appropriate. However, it
      is very helpful if some validation and vetting of the provided
      information is performed in order to avoid outdated or inaccurate
      information. Additionally, because this is a static and
      location-agnostic document, it's quite likely that some questions are
      either irrelevant or confusing for some locations. Therefore, "not
      really relevant here" and "we don't know" may be valid answers to some
      of these questions. In those cases, it's better to say this explicitly rather
      than to simply omit the section, as this will confirm that the
      information was not simply omitted. The main thing to remember when
      providing information in these categories is that those traveling to the
      event have not been there before, so one should not assume a high
      level of background knowledge about the area, its customs, etc.</t>

      <section title="Travel" anchor="travel">
        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Recommended airport(s) for domestic and international
            connections. To avoid confusion, include the appropriate
International Air Transport Association (IATA) airport code(s)
            whenever possible.</t>

            <t>Non-flight options to get to the city where the meeting is
            being held (e.g., if there are convenient rail travel options).</t>
          </list></t>

        <section title="Transit between the Airport or Train Station and Primary Hotels">
          <t>Information in this section is especially critical if the airport
          is significantly distant from the venue or use of a taxi is
          otherwise impractical or not recommended (e.g., if attendees must use
          a train or long-distance bus to get to the venue from the
          airport). If train travel options are provided as an alternative to
          flying, it is recommended that the list below be provided for those
          options as well (e.g., transit between the train station and primary
          hotel).</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>Estimated travel time. This is also important for return
              travel from the venue to the airport. It is worth noting any
              recommendations about leaving extra time if airport security and
              check-in is always busy or if there will be significant differences
              in travel time due to rush hour traffic.</t>

              <t>Shuttles (if applicable).</t>

              <t>Arranging transit directly with the hotel (if applicable).
              Hotels sometimes provide car service or are willing to pay taxi
              bills upon your arrival so that the charges can be added to the
              hotel bill instead of requiring local currency. It is helpful to
              know in advance if this is common or uncommon in the local
              area.</t>
            </list></t>

          <section title="Taxi Information">
            <t><list style="symbols">

                <t>Foreign currency accepted?</t>

                <t>Estimated costs for taxis, as well as any
                rules/recommendations about metered fares versus fixed-rate or
                pre-negotiated fares</t>

                <t>Description of "official" taxis if appropriate</t>

                <t>Links to websites or phone numbers for remote/pre-booking
                taxis</t>

                <t>How to find the taxi stand at the airport/train station</t>

                <t>Printable local-language address card to show taxi driver
                in case of language barrier</t>

                <t>Ride sharing (the IETF wiki usually has a section where
                attendees can post arrival times and work out taxi sharing)</t>

          </section>

          <section title="Mass Transit">
            <t>Navigating an unfamiliar mass transit system can be
            challenging. Things that seem obvious to locals may not be
            obvious to visitors.</t>

                stamped, how to transfer, etc.)</t>

                <t>How trains/buses are labeled and how to identify the
                destination of a particular train/bus</t>

                <t>The general frequency of service -- in particular, whether
                one should just go to the station or consult a schedule
                first</t>

                <t>Which transit system to use for which destination (when
                there are multiple transit systems in the area)</t>

                <t>Nearby stations and how to identify a station entrance
                (common logo, color, etc.)</t>

               <t>It may be helpful to advise when things are not commonly
labeled in a western character set (e.g., place signs) and provide pictures or
unicode text representations of the signage as it will appear.</t>

        <section title="Getting Around near the Conference Venue">
          <t>The same information relevant for airport transit will likely be
          relevant here, including taxi and mass transit information. If
          possible, walking directions between the conference venue and the
          hotel(s) should be provided if the venue is not co-located with the
          hotel.</t>

          <t>Additionally, it is helpful to note if having a vehicle available
          (rental or personal car) is a help or a hindrance in getting around
          in the local area. For example, it may not be recommended to try to
          drive in the area near the conference venue due to:<list
              style="symbols">
              <t>Parking availability and costs</t>

              <t>Congestion charges and other restrictions on when and where
              one can drive</t>

            <t>Visa requirements, pointers regarding travel documents.  IETF
            typically provides information about visas via a pointer to an
            embassy or similar page that has general information about common
            types of visas, when they are required, waived, etc. It also
            includes information about how to obtain a letter of invitation
            should one be required. It is helpful to provide information that
            goes beyond that, especially if there are known issues where it
            may be difficult for entrants from certain countries to get a visa
            processed in the time between when the meeting is announced and
            when travel must commence. If there are expedite processes, this
            is a good place to discuss them.</t>

            <t>National/regional holidays, work stoppages/strikes, or other
            issues that may impact travel or business hours during the week

              with health or respiratory problems may need to be able to
              locate local air-quality monitoring information to determine how to
              best prepare themselves.</t>

      <section title="Food" anchor="food">
        <t>The nature of IETF's schedule means that food and drink provide
        both a welcome break as well as a venue to continue discussions with
        colleagues, either related to IETF work, other shop talk, or anything
        *but* shop talk. During IETF's lunch break, approximately 1000 people
        are simultaneously looking for reasonably priced lunch options, with
        time frames ranging from "grab and go" for a working lunch to 75
        minutes for a sit-down meal. When meetings have concluded for the day,
        the wide variety of attendees means that people are looking for all
        types of food, all price ranges, and atmospheres ranging from a place
        suitable for an in-depth conversation to a table at the bar. The more
        information that is available about the food and drink options nearby,
        the better. This information is especially helpful during the first
        few days of the conference, because the number of folks looking for
        assistance from the hotel concierge or other information desk staff at

              <t>Special dietary needs such as vegan, vegetarian, halal, and
kosher.  It's also extremely helpful to discuss methods for

            <t>Soccer: If the weather cooperates, it is common for some
            IETFers to try to hold a "soccer BoF" -- a pick-up soccer game
            sometime during the week of IETF. Thus, a field
            appropriate for soccer in close proximity to the venue is useful
            information to have.</t>

      <section title="Tourism and Souvenirs">
        <t>While this is certainly not necessary information for the primary
        goal of an IETF attendee, many attendees earmark a day or two on
        either side of the conference for sightseeing, so this is an
        opportunity to highlight local attractions. Links to sites containing
        information about walking tours, local tourist attractions and the
        like are certainly appreciated. If there are events scheduled adjacent
        to IETF such as music or food festivals, cultural events, etc.,
        attendees are happy to hear about these events as well. </t>

        <t>Additionally, many attendees choose to purchase souvenirs as gifts
        or for personal use. In addition to the standard "tourist-trap" items
        such as t-shirts and knick-knacks, many attendees look for
        items that are locally crafted, local specialties, or otherwise
        significant to the local area and culture. This is another topic that can be highlighted in the information provided to
        attendees.</t>
