    <abstract>
      <t>
        Remote triggered black hole filtering describes a method of mitigating
        the effects of denial-of-service attacks by selectively discarding
        traffic based on source or destination address. Remote triggered black
        hole routing describes a method of selectively re-routing traffic into
        a sinkhole router (for further analysis) based on destination address.
        This document updates the "IPv6 Special Purpose Address Registry" by
        explaining why a unique IPv6 prefix should be formally assigned by
        IANA for the purpose of facilitating IPv6 remote triggered black hole
        filtering and routing.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        Remote Triggered Black Hole (RTBH) filtering describes a class of
        methods of blocking IP traffic either from a specific source (<xref
        target="RFC5635"/>) or to a specific destination (<xref
        target="RFC3882"/>) on a network. RTBH routing describes a class of
        methods of re-routing IP traffic destined to the attacked/targeted
        host to a special path (tunnel) where a sniffer could capture the
        traffic for analysis. Both of these methods operate by setting the
        next-hop address of an IP packet with a specified source or
        destination address to be a unicast prefix that is connected locally
        or remotely to a router's discard, null, or tunnel interface.
        Typically, reachability information for this prefix is propagated
        throughout an autonomous system using a dynamic routing protocol such
        as BGP (<xref target="RFC3882"/>). By deploying RTBH systems across a
        network, traffic to or from specific destinations may be selectively
        black-holed or re-routed to a sinkhole device in a manner that is
        efficient, scalable, and straightforward to implement. 
      </t>
      <t>
        On some networks, operators configure RTBH installations using <xref
        target="RFC1918"/> address space or the address blocks reserved for
        documentation in <xref target="RFC5737"/>. This approach is inadequate
        because RTBH configurations are not documentation, but rather
        operationally important features of many public-facing production
        networks. Furthermore, <xref target="RFC3849" /> specifies that the
        IPv6 documentation prefix should be filtered in both local and public
        contexts. On this basis, it is suggested that both private network
        address blocks and the documentation prefixes described in <xref
        target="RFC5737"/> are inappropriate for RTBH configurations and that
        a dedicated IPv6 prefix should be assigned instead.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document updates the "IPv6 Special Purpose Address Registry" <xref
        target="IANA-IPV6REG" />.
      </t>
      <section title="Notational Conventions">
        <t>
           The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
          "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
          document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
          target="RFC2119" />.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="A Discard Prefix for IPv6">
      <t>
        For the purposes of implementing an IPv6 RTBH
        configuration, a unicast address block is required. There are
        currently no IPv6 unicast address blocks that are specifically
        nominated for the purposes of implementing such RTBH systems.
      </t>
      <t>
        While it could be argued that there are other addresses and address
        prefixes that could be used for this purpose (e.g., documentation
        prefixes, private address space), or that an operator could assign an
        address block from their own address space for this purpose, there is
        currently no operational clarity on what address block would be
        appropriate or inappropriate to use for this purpose. By assigning a
        globally unique discard prefix for IPv6, the IETF will introduce good
        practice for the implementation of IPv6 RTBH configurations and will
        facilitate operational clarity by allowing operators to implement
        consistent and deterministic inter-domain prefix and traffic filtering
        policies for black-holed traffic.
      </t>
      <t>
        As <xref target="RFC3882" /> and <xref target="RFC5635" /> describe
        situations where more than one discard address may be used for
        implementing multiple RTBH scenarios, a single
        address is not sufficient to cover all likely RTBH situations.
        Consequently, an address block is required.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Operational Implications" anchor="implications">
      <t>
        This assignment MAY be carried in a dynamic routing protocol within an
        autonomous system. The assignment SHOULD NOT be announced to or
        accepted from third-party autonomous systems, and IPv6 traffic with a
        destination address within this prefix SHOULD NOT be forwarded to or
        accepted from third-party autonomous systems. If the prefix or a
        subnet of the prefix is inadvertently announced to or accepted from a
        third-party autonomous system, this may cause excessive volumes of
        traffic to pass unintentionally between the two networks, which
        would aggravate the effect of a denial-of-service attack.
      </t>
      <t>
        On networks that implement IPv6 remote triggered black holes, some or
        all of this network block MAY be configured with a next-hop
        destination of a discard or null interface on any or all IPv6 routers
        within the autonomous system. 
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
        Per this document, IANA has recorded the allocation of the IPv6
        address prefix 0100::/64 as a Discard-Only Prefix in the "Internet
Protocol Version 6 Address Space" and added the prefix to the "IANA IPv6 Special
Purpose Address Registry"
        <xref target="IANA-IPV6REG" />. No end party has been
        assigned to this prefix. The prefix has been allocated from ::/3.
     </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        As the prefix specified in this document ought not normally be
        transmitted or accepted over inter-domain BGP sessions for the
        reasons described in <xref target="implications" />, it is usually
        appropriate to include this prefix in inter-domain BGP prefix
        filters <xref target="RFC3704" /> or otherwise ensure the prefix is
        neither transmitted to nor accepted from a third-party autonomous
        system.
