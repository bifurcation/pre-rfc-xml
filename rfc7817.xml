        This document describes the Transport Layer Security (TLS) server identity verification procedure for SMTP Submission,
        IMAP, POP, and ManageSieve clients. 
It replaces 
Section 2.4 (Server Identity Check) of RFC 2595 and updates 
Section 4.1 (Processing After the STARTTLS Command) of RFC 3207,
Section 11.1 (STARTTLS Security Considerations) of RFC 3501, and 
Section 2.2.1 (Server Identity Check) of RFC 5804.

    <section title="Introduction">

	<t>
   Use of TLS by SMTP Submission, IMAP, POP, and ManageSieve clients is described in <xref target="RFC3207"/>,
   <xref target="RFC3501"/>, <xref target="RFC2595"/>, and <xref target="RFC5804"/>, respectively.
   Each of the documents describes slightly different rules for server certificate identity verification
   (or doesn't define any rules at all). In reality, email client and server developers implement many of
   these protocols at the same time, so it would be good to define modern and consistent rules for verifying
   email server identities using TLS.
	</t>
	
	<t>
	 This document describes the updated TLS server identity verification procedure
	 for SMTP Submission <xref target="RFC6409"/> <xref target="RFC3207"/>, IMAP <xref target="RFC3501"/>,
	 POP <xref target="RFC1939"/>, and ManageSieve <xref target="RFC5804"/> clients.
   <xref target="rules"/> of this document replaces Section 2.4 of <xref target="RFC2595"/>.
	</t>

	 Note that this document doesn't apply to use of TLS in
	 MTA-to-MTA SMTP.

     Open Issue: This is covered by draft-friedl-uta-smtp-mta-certs,

	</t>
	
	<t>
    This document provides a consistent TLS server identity
    verification procedure across multiple email-related protocols.
    This should make it easier for Certification Authorities (CAs) and ISPs to deploy TLS
    for email use and would enable email client developers to write more secure
    code.

      <t>
        The following terms or concepts are used through the document:

        <list style='hanging'>
          <t hangText='reference identifier:'>
            One
            of the domain names that the email client (an SMTP, IMAP, POP3,
            or ManageSieve client) associates with the target email server.
            For some identifier types, the identifier also
            includes an application service type.
            Reference identifiers are used for performing name checks on
            server certificates. (This term is formally defined in <xref target='RFC6125'/>.)

      <t>CN-ID, DNS-ID, SRV-ID, and URI-ID are identifier types (see <xref target='RFC6125'/> for details).
      For convenience, their short definitions from <xref target='RFC6125'/> are listed below:

   <section title="Email Server Certificate Verification Rules" anchor="rules">

     <t>
   During a TLS negotiation, an email client (i.e., an SMTP, IMAP, POP3,
   or ManageSieve client) MUST check its understanding
   of the server identity (client's reference identifiers) against the server's identity as presented in
   the server Certificate message in order to prevent man-in-the-middle
   attacks. This check is only performed after the server certificate passes
   certification path validation as described in Section 6 of <xref target='RFC5280'/>.
   Matching is performed according to the rules specified in
   Section 6 of <xref target='RFC6125'/>,
   including the relative order of matching of different identifier types, "certificate pinning", and the procedure on failure to match.
   The following inputs are used by the verification procedure used in
   <xref target='RFC6125'/>:
   
<list style="numbers">

       <t>
       For DNS-ID and CN-ID identifier types, the client MUST use
       one or more of the following as "reference identifiers":
       (a) the domain portion of the user's email address,
       (b) the hostname it used to open the connection (without CNAME canonicalization).
       The client MAY also use (c) a value securely derived from (a) or (b), such as
       using "secure" DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4033"/> <xref target="RFC4034"/>
       <xref target="RFC4035"/>
       validated lookup.
     </t>
         
       <t>
       When using email service discovery procedure specified in <xref target="RFC6186"/>,
       the client MUST also use the domain portion of the user's email address as another "reference identifier"
       to compare against an SRV-ID identifier in the server certificate.
       </t>

</list>
       
     </t>

	<t>    
   The rules and guidelines defined in <xref target='RFC6125'/>
   apply to an email server certificate with the following supplemental rules:
   
<list style="numbers">
    
      <t>
      Support for the DNS-ID identifier type (subjectAltName of dNSName type <xref target="RFC5280"/>) is REQUIRED
      in email client software implementations.
      </t>

      <t>
      Support for the SRV-ID identifier type (subjectAltName of SRVName type <xref target="RFC4985"/>) is REQUIRED for
      email client software implementations that support <xref target="RFC6186"/>.
      A list of SRV-ID types for email services is specified in <xref target="RFC6186"/>.
      For the ManageSieve protocol, the service name "sieve" is used.
      </t>
    
      <t>A URI-ID identifier type (subjectAltName of uniformResourceIdentifier type <xref target="RFC5280"/>) MUST NOT be used by clients for server verification, as
      URI-IDs were not historically used for email.</t>

      <t>For backward compatibility with deployed software, a CN-ID identifier type (CN attribute from the subject name, see <xref target='RFC6125'/>)
         MAY be used for server identity verification.</t>
	  
      <t>Email protocols allow use of certain wildcards in identifiers
      presented by email servers.
      The "*" wildcard character MAY be used as the left-most name
      component of a DNS-ID or CN-ID in the certificate.
      For example, a DNS-ID of "*.example.com" would
      match "a.example.com", "foo.example.com", etc., but would not match
      "example.com".
      Note that the wildcard character MUST NOT be used as a fragment
      of the left-most name component (e.g., "*oo.example.com",
      "f*o.example.com", or "foo*.example.com").

      <section title="Notes on Handling of Delegated Email Services by Certification Authorities" anchor="ca-delegated">

        <t>
        <xref target="RFC6186"/> provides an easy way for organizations to autoconfigure
        email clients. It also allows for delegation of email services to an email hosting provider.
        When connecting to such delegated hosting service, an email client that attempts to verify
        TLS server identity needs to know that if it connects to "imap.hosting.example.net",
        such server is authorized to provide email access for an email such as alice@example.org.
        In absence of SRV-IDs, users of compliant email clients would be forced to manually confirm exceptions
        because the TLS server certificate verification procedures specified in this document would result in failure
        to match the TLS server certificate against the expected domain(s).
        
        One way to provide such authorization is for the TLS certificate for "imap.hosting.example.net"
        to include SRV-ID(s) (or a DNS-ID) for the "example.org" domain.
        
        Note that another way is for DNS Service Record (SRV) lookups to be protected by DNSSEC, but this solution depends
        on ubiquitous use of DNSSEC and availability of DNSSEC-aware APIs and thus is not discussed in this document.
        A future update to this document might rectify this.
        </t>

        <t>
        A CA that receives a Certificate Signing Request containing multiple unrelated DNS-IDs and/or SRV-IDs
        (e.g., a DNS-ID of "example.org" and a DNS-ID of "example.com") needs to
	verify that the entity that supplied such Certificate Signing Request
	is authorized to provide email service for all requested domains.</t>

	<t>The ability to issue certificates that contain an SRV-ID (or a
	DNS-ID for the domain part of email addresses) implies the ability to verify
	that entities requesting them are authorized to run email service for
	these SRV-IDs/DNS-IDs.  In particular, CAs that
	can't verify such authorization (whether for a particular domain or
	in general) MUST NOT include such email SRV-IDs/DNS-IDs in
	certificates they issue.  This document doesn't specify exact
	mechanism(s) that can be used to achieve this.  However, a few
	special case recommendations are listed below.</t>

        <t>A CA willing to sign a certificate containing
	a particular DNS-ID SHOULD also support signing a certificate
        containing one or more of the email SRV-IDs for the same domain
        because the SRV-ID effectively provides more restricted access to an email service for the domain
        (as opposed to unrestricted use of any services for the same domain,
	as specified by the DNS-ID).
        </t>

        <t>
        A CA that also provides DNS service for a domain can
        use DNS information to validate SRV-IDs/DNS-IDs for the domain.
        </t>

        <t>
        A CA that is also a Mail Service Provider for a hosted domain can
        use that knowledge to validate SRV-IDs/DNS-IDs for the domain.

            DNS-IDs, or a single certificate with wildcard in a CN-ID can be used).

      <section title="Notes on Hosting Multiple Domains" anchor="msp-hosted">

        <t>A server that hosts multiple domains needs to do one of the following (or some combination thereof):

        <list style='numbers'>

          <t>
          Use DNS SRV records to redirect each hosted email service to a fixed domain,
          deploy TLS certificate(s) for that single domain, and instruct users to
          configure their clients with appropriate pinning (unless the SRV records
          can always be obtained via DNSSEC).  Some email clients come with
	  preloaded lists of pinned certificates for some popular domains; this can avoid the need
	  for manual confirmation.
          </t>
          
          <t>
          Use a single TLS certificate that includes a complete list of all the domains
          it is serving.
          </t>

          <t>
          Serve each domain on its own IP/port, using separate TLS certificates on each IP/port.
          </t>

          <t>
          Use the Server Name Indication (SNI) TLS extension <xref target='RFC6066'/> to select the right certificate
          to return during TLS negotiation. Each domain has its own TLS certificate in this case.
          </t>

        </list>
        </t>

        <t>
        Each of these deployment choices have their scaling disadvantages when the list of domains changes.
        Use of DNS SRV without an SRV-ID requires manual confirmation from users. While preloading pinned
        certificates avoids the need for manual confirmation, this information can get stale quickly
        or would require support for a new mechanism for distributing preloaded pinned certificates.
        A single certificate (the second choice) requires that when a domain is added,
        then a new Certificate Signing Request that includes a complete list of all the domains
        needs to be issued and passed to a CA in order to generate a new certificate.
        A separate IP/port can avoid regenerating the certificate but requires more transport layer resources.
        Use of TLS SNI requires each email client to use it.
        </t>

        <t>
        Several Mail Service Providers host hundreds and even thousands of domains.
        This document, as well as its predecessors, RFCs 2595, 3207, 3501, and 5804,
        don't address scaling issues caused by use of TLS in multi-tenanted environments.
        Further work is needed to address this issue, possibly using DNSSEC or something like
        <xref target="RFC7711">PKIX over Secure HTTP (POSH)</xref>.

   <section title="Examples">
	
      <t>
   Consider an IMAP-accessible email server that supports both
   IMAP and IMAP-over-TLS (IMAPS) at the host
   "mail.example.net" servicing email addresses of the form
   "user@example.net".
   A certificate for this service needs to include
   DNS-IDs of "example.net" (because it is the domain portion of emails)
   and "mail.example.net" (this is what a user of this server enters manually if not using <xref target="RFC6186"/>).
   It might also include a CN-ID of "mail.example.net"
   for backward compatibility with deployed infrastructure.
      </t>
      <t>
   Consider the IMAP-accessible email server from the previous paragraph
   that is additionally discoverable via DNS SRV lookups
   in domain "example.net" (using DNS SRV records "_imap._tcp.example.net"
   and "_imaps._tcp.example.net").  In addition to the DNS-ID/CN-ID identity types specified above,
   a certificate for this service also needs to include SRV-IDs of "_imap.example.net" (when STARTTLS is used on the IMAP port)
   and "_imaps.example.net" (when TLS is used on IMAPS port). See <xref target="RFC6186"/> for more details.
   (Note that unlike DNS SRV there is no "_tcp" component in SRV-IDs).
      </t>
      
      <t>
   Consider the IMAP-accessible email server from the first paragraph
   that is running on a host also known as "mycompany.example.com".
   In addition to the DNS-ID identity types specified above,
   a certificate for this service also needs to include a 
   DNS-ID of "mycompany.example.com" (this is what a user of this server enters manually if not using <xref target="RFC6186"/>).
   It might also include a CN-ID of "mycompany.example.com" instead of the CN-ID "mail.example.net"
   for backward compatibility with deployed infrastructure.
   (This is so, because a certificate can only include a single CN-ID)
      </t>
      
	
      <t>
   Consider an SMTP Submission server at the host
   "submit.example.net" servicing email addresses of the form
   "user@example.net" and discoverable via DNS SRV lookups
   in domain "example.net" (using DNS SRV record "_submission._tcp.example.net").
   A certificate for this
   service needs to include SRV-IDs of "_submission.example.net"
   (see <xref target="RFC6186"/>) along with DNS-IDs of
   "example.net" and "submit.example.net".  It might also include a CN-ID
   of "submit.example.net" for backward compatibility
   with deployed infrastructure.
      </t>

      <t>
   Consider a host "mail.example.net" servicing email addresses of the form
   "user@example.net" and discoverable via DNS SRV lookups in domain "example.net",
   which runs SMTP Submission, IMAPS and POP3S (POP3-over-TLS), and ManageSieve services.
   Each of the servers can use their own certificate specific to their service
   (see examples above). Alternatively, they can all share a single certificate
   that would include SRV-IDs of "_submission.example.net",
   "_imaps.example.net", "_pop3s.example.net", and "_sieve.example.net"
   along with DNS-IDs of "example.net" and "mail.example.net".
   It might also include a CN-ID of "mail.example.net"
   for backward compatibility with deployed infrastructure.

      <t><xref target="msp"/> covers operational considerations (in particular, use of DNS SRV for autoconfiguration)
      related to generating TLS certificates for email servers so that they can be successfully verified by email clients.

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="seccons">

	    <t>The goal of this document is to improve interoperability and
      thus security of email clients wishing to access email servers
      over TLS-protected email protocols by specifying a consistent
      set of rules that email service providers, email client writers,
      and CAs can use when creating server certificates.</t>

      <t>
      The TLS server identity check for email relies on use of trustworthy DNS hostnames
      when constructing "reference identifiers" that are checked against an email server certificate.
      Such trustworthy names are either entered manually (for example, if they are advertised on a Mail Service Provider's website),
      explicitly confirmed by the user (e.g., if they are a target of a DNS SRV lookup), or
      derived using a secure third party service (e.g., DNSSEC-protected SRV records
      that are verified by the client or trusted local resolver).
      Future work in this area might benefit from integration with DNS-Based
      Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) <xref target="RFC6698"/>,
      but it is not covered by this document.

    <section title="Changes to RFCs 2595, 3207, 3501, and 5804">

      <t>This section lists detailed changes this document applies to RFCs 2595, 3207, 3501, and 5804.</t>

      <t>The entire Section 2.4 of RFC 2595 is replaced with the following text:
      <list>
        <t>
          During the TLS negotiation, the client checks its understanding
          of the server identity against the provided server's identity as specified in
          <xref target="rules"/> of [RFC7817].
        </t>
      </list>
      </t>
      
      <t>The 3rd paragraph (and its subparagraphs) in Section 11.1 of RFC 3501 is replaced with the following text:
      <list>
        <t>
          During the TLS negotiation, the IMAP client checks its understanding
          of the server identity against the provided server's identity as specified in
          <xref target="rules"/> of [RFC7817].
        </t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>The 3rd paragraph (and its subparagraphs) in Section 4.1 of RFC 3207 is replaced with the following text:
      <list>
        <t>
          During the TLS negotiation, the Submission client checks its understanding
          of the server identity against the provided server's identity as specified in
          <xref target="rules"/> of [RFC7817].
        </t>
      </list>
      </t>


      <t>Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.1.1 of RFC 5804 are replaced with the following text:
      <list>
        <t>
          During the TLS negotiation, the ManageSieve client checks its understanding
          of the server identity against the server's identity as specified in
          <xref target="rules"/> of [RFC7817]. When the
	  reference identity is an IP address, the iPAddress
          subjectAltName SHOULD be used by the client for comparison.  The
          comparison is performed as described in Section 2.2.1.2 of RFC 5804.
