<abstract>

<t>
   This document defines two Management Information Base (MIB) modules that
   contain Textual Conventions to represent commonly used Bidirectional
   Forwarding Detection (BFD) management information.  The intent is
   that these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and used in
   BFD-related MIB modules that would otherwise define their own
   representations.

    <section title="Introduction">

<t>
   This document defines two MIB modules that contain Textual Conventions
   for Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocols.  These
   Textual Conventions should be imported by MIB modules that manage
   BFD protocols.
</t>

<t>
   Note that names of Textual Conventions defined in this document are
   prefixed with either "Bfd" or "IANA" to make it obvious to readers that 
   some are specific to BFD modules, whereas others are IANA maintained.
</t> 

<t>
   For an introduction to the concepts of BFD, see <xref target="RFC5880" />, <xref target="RFC5881" />, <xref target="RFC5883" />, <xref target="RFC6428" />, and <xref target="RFC7130" />.

<section title="Requirements Language">

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>

<t>
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 <xref target="RFC3410" />.
</t>

<t>
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 <xref target="RFC2578" />, STD 58, RFC 2579 <xref target="RFC2579" /> and STD 58, RFC 2580 <xref target="RFC2580" />.

 DESCRIPTION
     "BFD authentication key type.

      An IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC is always interpreted
      within the context of an IANAbfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC
      value.  Every usage of the IANAbfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC
      textual convention is required to specify the
      IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC object that provides the
      context.  It is suggested that the
      IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC object be logically registered
      before the object(s) that use the
      IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC textual convention, if they
      appear in the same logical row.

      The value of an IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC must
      always be consistent with the value of the associated
      IANAbfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC object.  Attempts to set an
      IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC object to a value inconsistent
      with the associated IANAbfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC must fail
      with an inconsistentValue error.

      The following size constraints for an
      IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC object are defined for the
      associated IANAbfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC values show below:

      noAuthentication(-1): SIZE(0)
      reserved(0): SIZE(0)
      simplePassword(1): SIZE(1..16)
      keyedMD5(2): SIZE(16)
      meticulousKeyedMD5(3): SIZE(16)
      keyedSHA1(4): SIZE(20)
      meticulousKeyedSHA1(5): SIZE(20)

      When this textual convention is used as the syntax of an
      index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
      sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58.  In this case,
      the object definition MUST include a 'SIZE' clause to limit
      the number of potential instance sub-identifiers; otherwise,
      the applicable constraints MUST be stated in the appropriate
      conceptual row DESCRIPTION clauses, or in the surrounding
      documentation if there is no single DESCRIPTION clause that
      is appropriate."
