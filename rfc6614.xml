	    <t>This document specifies a transport profile for RADIUS using Transport Layer Security (TLS) over TCP as the transport protocol. This enables dynamic trust
relationships between RADIUS servers.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>
  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
	<t>The RADIUS protocol <xref target="RFC2865" /> is a widely deployed
authentication and authorization protocol. The supplementary RADIUS Accounting
specification <xref target="RFC2866" /> provides accounting mechanisms,
thus delivering a full Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) solution. However, RADIUS is experiencing several
shortcomings, such as its dependency on the unreliable transport protocol UDP
and the lack of security for large parts of its packet payload. RADIUS security
is based on the MD5 algorithm, which has been proven to be insecure.</t>
	
	<t>The main focus of RADIUS over TLS is to provide a means to secure the
communication between RADIUS/TCP peers using TLS. The most
important use of this specification lies in roaming environments where RADIUS packets need
to be transferred through different administrative domains and untrusted,
potentially hostile networks. An example for a worldwide roaming environment
that uses RADIUS over TLS to secure communication is "eduroam", see <xref
target="eduroam"/>.</t>
	
	<t>There are multiple known attacks on the MD5 algorithm that is used
in RADIUS to provide integrity protection and a limited confidentiality
protection (see <xref target="MD5-attacks" />). RADIUS over TLS wraps the entire RADIUS packet payload into a TLS stream and
thus mitigates the risk of attacks on MD5.</t> 
	
	<t>Because of the static trust establishment between RADIUS peers (IP
address and shared secret), the only scalable way of creating a massive
deployment of RADIUS servers under the control of different administrative entities
is to introduce some form of a proxy chain to route the access requests to their
home server. This creates a lot of overhead in terms of possible points of
failure, longer transmission times, as well as middleboxes through which
authentication traffic flows. These middleboxes may learn privacy-relevant data
while forwarding requests. The new features in RADIUS over TLS obsolete the use of IP
addresses and shared MD5 secrets to identify other peers and thus allow the
use of more contemporary trust models, e.g., checking a certificate by inspecting the
issuer and other certificate properties.</t>
	<section title="Requirements Language" anchor="reqlang">
		<t>In this document, several words are used to signify the
requirements of the specification.  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
"REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119

        <section title="Document Status" anchor="status">
                <t>This document is an Experimental RFC.</t>
                <t>It is one out of several approaches to address known cryptographic weaknesses of the RADIUS protocol (see also <xref target="radius-compat"/>). The specification does not fulfill all recommendations on a AAA transport profile as per <xref target="RFC3539"/>; in particular, by being based on TCP as a transport layer, it does not prevent head-of-line blocking issues.</t>
<t>If this specification is indeed selected for advancement to Standards Track, certificate verification options (Section 2.3, point 2) need to be refined.</t>

<t>Another experimental characteristic of this specification is the question of
key management between RADIUS/TLS peers. RADIUS/UDP only allowed for manual key
management, i.e., distribution of a shared secret between a client and a
server. 
RADIUS/TLS allows manual distribution of long-term proofs of peer identity as
well (by using TLS-PSK ciphersuites, or identifying clients by a certificate
fingerprint), but as a new feature enables use of X.509 certificates in a PKIX
infrastructure. It remains to be seen if one of these methods will prevail or
if both will find their place in real-life deployments.  
The authors can imagine pre-shared keys (PSK) to be popular in small-scale
deployments (Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) or isolated enterprise
deployments) where scalability is not an issue and the deployment of a
Certification Authority (CA) is considered too much of a hassle; however, the
authors can also imagine large roaming consortia to make use of PKIX.  
Readers of this specification are encouraged to read the discussion of key
management issues within <xref target="RFC6421"/> as well as <xref
target="RFC4107"/>.</t> 
<t>It has yet to be decided whether this approach is to be chosen for Standards
Track. One key aspect to judge whether the approach is usable on a large scale
is by observing the uptake, usability, and operational behavior of the protocol
in large-scale, real-life deployments.</t> 
<t>An example for a worldwide roaming environment that uses RADIUS over TLS to
secure communication is "eduroam", see <xref target="eduroam"/>.</t>

	<section title="TCP port and Packet Types" anchor="ports">
		<t>The default destination port number for RADIUS over TLS is TCP/2083.
There are no separate ports for authentication, accounting, and dynamic
authorization changes. The source port is arbitrary. See <xref target="design-radius" /> for considerations regarding the separation of authentication, accounting, and dynamic authorization traffic.</t>

	<section title="TLS Negotiation" anchor="starttls">
		<t>RADIUS/TLS has no notion of negotiating TLS in an established connection. Servers and clients need to be preconfigured to use RADIUS/TLS for a given endpoint.</t>

		<t>RADIUS/TLS nodes
			<list style="numbers">
				<t>establish TCP connections as per <xref

				<t>after completing the TCP handshake, immediately negotiate TLS sessions according to <xref target="RFC5246" /> or its predecessor TLS 1.1. The following restrictions apply:
					<list style="symbols">
						<t>Support for TLS v1.1 <xref target="RFC4346"/> or later (e.g., TLS 1.2 <xref target="RFC5246"/>) is REQUIRED. To prevent known attacks on TLS versions prior to 1.1, implementations MUST NOT negotiate TLS versions prior to 1.1.</t>

						<t>Support for and negotiation of compression is OPTIONAL.</t>
						<t>Support for TLS-PSK mutual authentication <xref target="RFC4279"/> is OPTIONAL.</t>
						<t>RADIUS/TLS implementations
MUST, at a minimum, support negotiation of the TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA,
and SHOULD support TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA and TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA as
well (see <xref target="design-cipher" />.</t> 
						<t>In addition, RADIUS/TLS implementations MUST support negotiation of the mandatory-to-implement ciphersuites required by the versions of TLS that they support.</t>
					</list>
				</t>
				<t>Peer authentication can be performed in any of the following three operation models:
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>TLS with X.509 certificates using PKIX trust models (this model is mandatory to implement):
					<list style="symbols">
					<t>Implementations MUST allow the configuration of a list of trusted Certification Authorities for incoming connections.  </t>
					<t>Certificate validation MUST include the verification rules as per <xref target="RFC5280" />.</t>
					<t>Implementations SHOULD indicate their trusted Certification Authorities (CAs). For TLS 1.2, this is done using <xref target="RFC5246" />, Section 7.4.4, "certificate_authorities" (server side) and <xref target="RFC6066" />, Section 6 "Trusted CA Indication" (client side). See also <xref target="design-cert" />.</t>

<t>
                                                        Peer validation always
includes a check on whether the locally configured expected DNS name or IP
address of the server that is contacted matches its presented certificate. DNS
names and IP addresses can be contained in the Common Name (CN) or
subjectAltName entries. For verification, only one of these entries is to be
considered. The following precedence applies: for DNS name validation,
subjectAltName:DNS has precedence over CN; for IP address validation,
subjectAltName:iPAddr has precedence over CN. Implementors of this specification are advised to read <xref target="RFC6125"/>, Section 6, for more details on DNS name validation.
                                                </t>	
						<t>Implementations MAY allow the configuration of a set of additional properties of the certificate to check for a peer's authorization to communicate (e.g., a set of allowed values in subjectAltName:URI or a set of allowed X509v3 Certificate Policies).</t>
						<t>When the configured trust base changes (e.g., removal of a CA from the list of trusted CAs; issuance of a new CRL for a given CA), implementations MAY renegotiate the TLS session to reassess the connecting peer's continued authorization.</t>
					</list>
					</t>
					<t>TLS with X.509 certificates using certificate fingerprints (this model is optional to implement): Implementations SHOULD allow the configuration of a list of trusted certificates, identified via fingerprint of the DER encoded certificate octets. Implementations MUST support SHA-1 as the hash algorithm for the fingerprint. To prevent attacks based on hash collisions, support for a more contemporary hash function such as SHA-256 is RECOMMENDED.</t>

				</t>
				<t>
					start exchanging RADIUS datagrams (note <xref target="design-radius" /> (1)). The shared secret to compute the (obsolete) MD5 integrity checks and attribute encryption MUST be "radsec" (see <xref target="design-radius" /> (2)).
				</t>
			</list>
		</t>
	</section>
	<section title="Connecting Client Identity">
		<t>In RADIUS/UDP, clients are uniquely identified by their IP
address. Since the shared secret is associated with the origin IP address,
if more than one RADIUS client is associated with the same IP
address, then those clients also must utilize the same shared secret,
a practice that is inherently insecure, as noted in <xref target="RFC5247" />.
		</t>
		<t>RADIUS/TLS supports multiple operation modes.</t>
                <t>In TLS-PSK operation, a client is uniquely identified by its TLS identifier.</t>
		<t>In TLS-X.509 mode using fingerprints, a client is uniquely identified by the fingerprint of the presented client certificate.</t>
		<t>In TLS-X.509 mode using PKIX trust models, a client is uniquely identified by the tuple (serial number of presented client certificate;Issuer).</t>
		<t>Note well: having identified a connecting entity does not mean the server necessarily wants to communicate with that client. For example, if the Issuer is not in a trusted set of Issuers, the server may decline to perform RADIUS transactions with this client.</t>
		<t>There are numerous trust models in PKIX environments, and it is beyond the scope of this document to define how a particular deployment determines whether a client is trustworthy. 
		   Implementations that want to support a wide variety of trust models should expose as many details of the presented certificate to the administrator as possible so that the trust model can be implemented by the administrator. As a suggestion, at least the following parameters of the X.509 client certificate should be exposed:
		<list style="symbols">
		  <t>Originating IP address</t>
		  <t>Certificate Fingerprint</t>
		  <t>Issuer</t>
		  <t>Subject</t>
		  <t>all X509v3 Extended Key Usage</t>
		  <t>all X509v3 Subject Alternative Name</t>
		  <t>all X509v3 Certificate Policies</t>
		</list>
In TLS-PSK operation, at least the following parameters of the TLS connection should be exposed:
		<list style= "symbols">

		  <t>TLS Identifier</t>

	<section title="RADIUS Datagrams">
		<t>Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting packets are sent
according to the following rules:</t>
		<t>RADIUS/TLS clients transmit the same packet types on the connection they initiated as a RADIUS/UDP client would (see <xref target="design-radius" /> (3) and (4)). For example, they send

				<t>Disconnect-Request</t>
				<t>...</t>
			</list></t>
		<t>RADIUS/TLS servers transmit the same packet types on
connections they have accepted as a RADIUS/UDP server would. For example, they
send 
			<list style= "symbols">
				<t>Access-Challenge</t>
                                <t>Access-Accept</t>

				<t>Accounting-Request</t>
				<t>Status-Server</t>
				<t>Disconnect-ACK</t>
				<t>...</t>

<t>Due to the use of one single TCP port for all packet types, it is required
that a RADIUS/TLS server signal which types of packets
are supported on a server to a connecting peer. See also <xref target="design-radius"/> for a
discussion of signaling.

		<t>When an unwanted packet of type 'Accounting-Request' is
received, the RADIUS/TLS server SHOULD reply with an Accounting-Response

				<t>If a RADIUS/TLS client is in possession of
multiple certificates from different CAs (i.e., is part of multiple roaming
consortia) and dynamic discovery is used, the discovery mechanism possibly does
not yield sufficient information to identify the consortium uniquely (e.g., DNS
discovery). Subsequently, the client may not know by itself which client
certificate to use for the TLS handshake. Then, it is necessary for the server to
signal to which consortium it belongs and which certificates it expects. If
there is no risk of confusing multiple roaming consortia, providing this
information in the handshake is not crucial.
			</t>
			<t>If a RADIUS/TLS server is in possession of
multiple certificates from different CAs (i.e., is part of multiple roaming
consortia), it will need to select one of its certificates to present to the
RADIUS/TLS client. If the client sends the Trusted CA Indication, this hint can make
the server select the appropriate certificate and prevent a handshake failure.
Omitting this indication makes it impossible to deterministically select the
right certificate in this case. If there is no risk of confusing multiple
roaming consortia, providing this indication in the handshake is not crucial.

cases. The existing implementations of RADIUS/TLS use OpenSSL as a cryptographic
backend, which supports all of the ciphersuites listed in the rules in the

	    <section title="RADIUS Datagram Considerations"
anchor="design-radius">

		    <t><list style="format (%d)">
<t> After the TLS session is established, RADIUS packet
payloads are exchanged over the encrypted TLS tunnel. In RADIUS/UDP, the
packet size can be determined by evaluating the size of the datagram that
arrived. Due to the stream nature of TCP and TLS, this does not hold true for
RADIUS/TLS packet exchange. Instead, packet boundaries of RADIUS packets that arrive
in the stream are calculated by evaluating the packet's Length field. Special
care needs to be taken on the packet sender side that the value of the Length
field is indeed correct before sending it over the TLS tunnel, because incorrect
packet lengths can no longer be detected by a differing datagram boundary. See
Section 2.6.4 of <xref target="RFC6613" /> for more details.</t>
		    <t>Within RADIUS/UDP <xref target="RFC2865"/>, a shared
secret is used for hiding attributes such as User-Password, as well as in
computation of the Response Authenticator.  In RADIUS accounting <xref
target="RFC2866"/>, the shared secret is used in computation of both the Request
Authenticator and the Response Authenticator. Since TLS  provides integrity
protection and encryption sufficient to substitute for RADIUS application-layer
security, it is not necessary to configure a RADIUS shared secret. The use of a
fixed string for the obsolete shared secret eliminates possible node
misconfigurations.</t>
		    <t>RADIUS/UDP <xref target="RFC2865" /> uses different UDP
ports for authentication, accounting, and dynamic authorization changes. RADIUS/TLS
allocates a single port for all RADIUS packet types. Nevertheless, in RADIUS/TLS, the
notion of a client that sends authentication requests and processes replies
associated with its users' sessions and the notion of a server that receives
requests, processes them, and sends the appropriate replies is to be preserved.
The normative rules about acceptable packet types for clients and servers mirror
the packet flow behavior from RADIUS/UDP.</t>
		    <t>RADIUS/UDP <xref target="RFC2865" /> uses negative ICMP
responses to a newly allocated UDP port to signal that a peer RADIUS server does
not support the reception and processing of the packet types in <xref
target="RFC5176" />. These packet types are listed as to be received in RADIUS/TLS
implementations. Note well: it is not required for an implementation to actually
process these packet types; it is only required that the NAK be sent as defined above.</t>

			<t>RADIUS/UDP <xref target="RFC2865" /> uses negative ICMP
responses to a newly allocated UDP port to signal that a peer RADIUS server does
not support the reception and processing of RADIUS Accounting packets. There is no RADIUS
datagram to signal an Accounting NAK. Clients may be misconfigured for sending Accounting packets to a
RADIUS/TLS server that does not wish to process their Accounting packet. To prevent a regression
of detectability of this situation, the Accounting-Response + Error-Cause signaling was introduced.</t></list></t>

to RADIUS/UDP or cross compatibility to the other transports, i.e., an
implementation that utilizes RADIUS/TLS only will not be able to receive or send
RADIUS packet payloads over other transports. An implementation wishing to be
backward or cross compatible (i.e., wishes to serve clients using other
transports than RADIUS/TLS) will need to implement these other transports along with the RADIUS/TLS
transport and be prepared to send and receive on all implemented transports,
which is called a "multi-stack implementation".
	    </t>
	    <t>
		If a given IP device is able to receive RADIUS payloads on
multiple transports, this may or may not be the same instance of software, and
it may or may not serve the same purposes. It is not safe to assume that both
ports are interchangeable. In particular, it cannot be assumed that state is
maintained for the packet payloads between the transports. Two such instances
MUST be considered separate RADIUS server entities.
	    </t>

    <section title="Diameter Compatibility" anchor="compat">
	    <t>
		    Since RADIUS/TLS is only a new transport profile for RADIUS,
the compatibility of RADIUS/TLS - Diameter <xref target="RFC3588" /> and RADIUS/UDP <xref
target="RFC2865" /> - Diameter <xref target="RFC3588" /> is identical. The
considerations regarding payload size in <xref
target="RFC6613" /> apply.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
	    <t>
		    The computational resources to establish a TLS tunnel are
significantly higher than simply sending mostly unencrypted UDP datagrams.
Therefore, clients connecting to a RADIUS/TLS node will more easily create high load
conditions and a malicious client might create a Denial-of-Service attack more
easily.</t>
	    <t>
		    Some TLS ciphersuites only provide integrity validation of
their payload, and provide no encryption. This specification forbids the use of
such ciphersuites. Since the RADIUS payload's shared secret is fixed to the well-known term "radsec"
(see Section 2.3 (4)), failure to comply with this requirement will expose the entire
datagram payload in plaintext, including User-Password, to intermediate IP
nodes.
	    </t>
	    <t>By virtue of being based on TCP, there are several generic attack vectors to slow down or prevent the TCP connection from being established; see <xref target="RFC4953"/> for details. If a TCP connection is not up when a packet is to be processed, it gets re-established, so such attacks in general lead only to a minor performance degradation (the time it takes to re-establish the connection). There is one notable exception where an attacker might create a bidding-down attack though.
		    If peer communication between two devices is configured for
both RADIUS/TLS (i.e., TLS security over TCP as a transport, shared secret fixed to "radsec") and RADIUS/UDP (i.e., shared secret
    security with a secret manually configured by the administrator), and 
the RADIUS/UDP transport is the failover option if the TLS session cannot be established, 
a bidding-down attack can occur if an adversary can maliciously close the TCP connection 
or prevent it from being established. Situations where clients are
configured in such a way are likely to occur during a migration phase from 
RADIUS/UDP to RADIUS/TLS. By preventing the TLS session setup, the attacker can reduce the security of the
packet payload from the selected TLS ciphersuite packet encryption
to the classic MD5 per-attribute encryption. The situation should be avoided by
disabling the weaker RADIUS/UDP transport as soon as the new RADIUS/TLS connection
is established and tested. Disabling can happen at either the RADIUS client or
server side:
<list style="symbols">
	<t>Client side: de-configure the failover setup, leaving RADIUS/TLS as the only communication option</t>
	<t>Server side: de-configure the RADIUS/UDP client from the list of valid RADIUS clients</t>
</list>
	    </t>
	    <t>RADIUS/TLS provides authentication and encryption
between RADIUS peers. In the presence of proxies, the intermediate proxies can
still inspect the individual RADIUS packets, i.e., "end-to-end" encryption is not
provided. Where intermediate proxies are untrusted, it is desirable to use other
RADIUS mechanisms to prevent RADIUS packet payload from inspection by such
proxies. One common method to protect passwords is the use of the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) and EAP methods that
utilize TLS.</t>
<t>
	When using certificate fingerprints to identify RADIUS/TLS peers, any
two certificates that produce the same hash value (i.e., that have a hash
collision) will be considered the same client. Therefore, it is important to
make sure that the hash function used is cryptographically uncompromised so
that an attacker is very unlikely to be able to produce a hash collision with a
certificate of his choice. While this specification mandates support for SHA-1,
a later revision will likely demand support for more contemporary hash
functions because as of issuance of this document, there are already attacks on
SHA-1.

The protocol transports data "in the clear", although some parts of the packets can have "hidden" content.

This document specifies how the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol may be used as a fix for these problems.

    <section title="Implementation Overview: Radiator" anchor="radiator">
	    <t>Radiator implements the RadSec protocol for proxying requests
with the &lt;Authby RADSEC&gt; and &lt;ServerRADSEC&gt; clauses in the Radiator
configuration file.</t>
	    <t>The &lt;AuthBy RADSEC&gt; clause defines a RadSec client, and
causes Radiator to send RADIUS requests to the configured RadSec server using
the RadSec protocol.</t>
	    <t>The &lt;ServerRADSEC&gt; clause defines a RadSec server, and
causes Radiator to listen on the configured port and address(es) for connections
from &lt;Authby RADSEC&gt; clients. When an &lt;Authby RADSEC&gt; client
connects to a &lt;ServerRADSEC&gt; server, the client sends RADIUS requests
through the stream to the server. The server then handles the request in the
same way as if the request had been received from a conventional UDP RADIUS
client.</t>
	    <t>Radiator is compliant to RADIUS/TLS if the following
options are used:
	    	<list style="empty">
			<t>&lt;AuthBy RADSEC&gt;
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>Protocol tcp</t>
					<t>UseTLS</t>
					<t>TLS_CertificateFile</t>
					<t>Secret radsec</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>&lt;ServerRADSEC&gt;
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>Protocol tcp</t>
					<t>UseTLS</t>
					<t>TLS_RequireClientCert</t>
					<t>Secret radsec</t>
				</list>
			</t>
		</list>
		As of Radiator 3.15, the default shared secret for RadSec
connections is configurable and defaults to "mysecret" (without quotes). For
compliance with this document, this setting needs to be configured for the
shared secret "radsec". The implementation uses TCP keepalive socket options,
but does not send Status-Server packets. Once established, TLS connections are
kept open throughout the server instance lifetime.
	    </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Implementation Overview: radsecproxy" anchor="radsecproxy">
	    <t>The RADIUS proxy named radsecproxy was written in order to allow
use of RadSec in current RADIUS deployments. This is a generic proxy that
supports any number and combination of clients and servers, supporting RADIUS
over UDP and RadSec. The main idea is that it can be used on the same host as a
non-RadSec client or server to ensure RadSec is used on the wire; however, as a
generic proxy, it can be used in other circumstances as well.</t>

	    <t>The configuration file consists of client and server clauses, where
  there is one such clause for each client or server.  In such a clause,
  one specifies either "type tls" or "type udp" for TLS or UDP
  transport. Versions prior to 1.6 used "mysecret" as a default shared
  secret for RADIUS/TLS; version 1.6 and onwards uses "radsec". For
  backwards compatibility with older versions, the secret can be
  changed (which makes the configuration not compliant with this
  specification).</t>

	    <t>In order to use TLS for clients and/or servers, one must also
specify where to locate CA certificates, as well as certificate and key for the
client or server. This is done in a TLS clause. There may be one or several TLS
clauses. A client or server clause may reference a particular TLS clause, or
just use a default one. One use for multiple TLS clauses may be to present one
certificate to clients and another to servers.</t>
	    <t>If any RadSec (TLS) clients are configured, the proxy will, at
startup, listen on port 2083, as assigned by IANA for the OSC RadSec
implementation. An alternative port may be specified. When a client connects,
the client certificate will be verified, including checking that the configured
Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or IP address matches what is in the certificate. Requests coming from a
RadSec client are treated exactly like requests from UDP clients.
	    </t>
	    <t>At startup, the proxy will try to establish a TLS connection to
each (if any) of the configured RadSec (TLS) servers. If it fails to connect to
a server, it will retry regularly. There is some back-off where it will retry
quickly at first, and with longer intervals later. If a connection to a server
goes down, it will also start retrying regularly. When setting up the TLS
connection, the server certificate will be verified, including checking that the
configured FQDN or IP address matches what is in the certificate. Requests are
sent to a RadSec server, just like they would be to a UDP server.</t>
	    <t>The proxy supports Status-Server messages. They are only sent to
a server if enabled for that particular server. Status-Server requests are
always responded to.</t>
	    <t>This RadSec implementation has been successfully tested together
with Radiator. It is a freely available, open-source implementation. For source
code and documentation, see <xref target="radsecproxy-impl" />.</t>

<section title="Assessment of Crypto-Agility Requirements" anchor="crypto-agility">
<t>The RADIUS Crypto-Agility Requirements document <xref target="RFC6421"/> defines
numerous classification criteria for protocols that strive to enhance the security
of RADIUS. It contains mandatory (M) and recommended (R) criteria that crypto-agile
protocols have to fulfill. The authors believe that the following assessment
about the crypto-agility properties of RADIUS/TLS are true.</t>
<t>By virtue of being a transport profile using TLS over TCP as a transport protocol, the cryptographically agile
properties of TLS are inherited, and RADIUS/TLS subsequently meets the following points:
<list>
<t>(M) negotiation of cryptographic algorithms for integrity and auth</t>
<t>(M) negotiation of cryptographic algorithms for encryption</t>
<t>(M) replay protection</t>
<t>(M) define mandatory-to-implement cryptographic algorithms</t>
<t>(M) generate fresh session keys for use between client and server</t>
<t>(R) support for Perfect Forward Secrecy in session keys</t>
<t>(R) support X.509 certificate-based operation</t>
<t>(R) support Pre-Shared keys</t>
<t>(R) support for confidentiality of the entire packet</t>
<t>(M/R) support Automated Key Management</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>The remainder of the requirements is discussed individually below in more detail:
<list>
<t>(M) "...avoid security compromise, even in situations where the existing cryptographic algorithms utilized by RADIUS implementations are shown to be weak enough to provide little or no security" <xref target="RFC6421" />.  The existing algorithm, based on MD5, is not of any significance in RADIUS/TLS; its compromise does not compromise the outer transport security.</t>
<t>(R) mandatory-to-implement algorithms are to be NIST-Acceptable with no deprecation date - The mandatory-to-implement algorithm is TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA. This ciphersuite supports three-key 3DES operation, which is classified as Acceptable with no known deprecation date by NIST.</t>
<t>(M) demonstrate backward compatibility with RADIUS - There are multiple implementations supporting both RADIUS and RADIUS/TLS, and the translation between them.</t>
<t>(M) After legacy mechanisms have been compromised, secure algorithms MUST be used, so that backward compatibility is no longer possible - In RADIUS, communication between client and server is always a manual configuration; after a compromise, the legacy client in question can be de-configured by the same manual configuration.</t>
<t>(M) indicate a willingness to cede change control to the IETF - Change control of this protocol is with the IETF.</t>
<t>(M) be interoperable between implementations based purely on the information in the specification - At least one implementation was created exclusively based on this specification and is interoperable with other RADIUS/TLS implementations.</t>
<t>(M) apply to all packet types - RADIUS/TLS operates on the transport layer, and can carry all packet types.</t>
<t>(R) message data exchanged with Diameter SHOULD NOT be affected - The solution is Diameter-agnostic.</t>
<t>(M) discuss any inherent assumptions - The authors are not aware of any
implicit assumptions that would be yet-unarticulated in the document.</t> 
<t>(R) provide recommendations for transition - The Security Considerations section contains a transition path.</t>
<t>(R) discuss legacy interoperability and potential for bidding-down attacks - The Security Considerations section contains a corresponding discussion.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Summarizing, it is believed that this specification fulfills all the mandatory and all the recommended requirements for a crypto-agile solution and should thus be considered UNCONDITIONALLY COMPLIANT.</t>
