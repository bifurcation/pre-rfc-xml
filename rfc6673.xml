    <abstract>
      <t>Many user applications (and the transport protocols that make them
      possible) require two-way communications. To assess this capability, and
      to achieve test system simplicity, round-trip loss measurements are
      frequently conducted in practice. The Two-Way Active Measurement
      Protocol specified in RFC 5357 establishes a round-trip loss measurement
      capability for the Internet. However, there is currently no round-trip
      packet loss metric specified according to the RFC 2330 framework.</t>

      <t>This memo adds round-trip loss to the set of IP Performance Metrics
      (IPPM).</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This memo defines a metric to quantify an IP network's ability to
      transfer packets in both directions from one host to another host.
      Two-way communication is almost always needed; thus, failure to transfer
      a packet in either direction constitutes a round-trip packet loss.</t>

      <t>This memo defines a metric for round-trip packet loss on Internet
      paths. It builds on the notions and conventions introduced in the IP
      Performance Metrics (IPPM) framework <xref target="RFC2330"></xref>.
      Also, the specifications of the one-way packet loss metric for IPPM
      <xref target="RFC2680"></xref> and the round-trip delay metric for IPPM
      <xref target="RFC2681"></xref> are frequently referenced and modified to
      match the round-trip circumstances addressed here. However, this memo
      assumes that the reader is familiar with the references; thus, it does
      not repeat material as was done in <xref target="RFC2681"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This memo uses the terms "two-way" and "round-trip" synonymously.</t>

      <section title="Motivation">
        <t>Many user applications and the transport protocols that make them
        possible require two-way communications. For example, the TCP
        SYN-&gt;, &lt;-SYN-ACK, ACK-&gt; three-way handshake attempted
        billions of times each day cannot be completed without two-way
        connectivity in a near-simultaneous time interval. Thus, measurements
        of Internet round-trip packet loss performance provide a basis to
        infer application performance more easily.</t>

        <t>Measurement system designers have also recognized advantages of
        system simplicity when one host simply echoes or reflects test packets
        to the sender. Round-trip packet loss measurements are frequently
        conducted and reported in practice. The ubiquitous "ping" tools allow
        the measurement of round-trip packet loss and delay but usually
        require ICMP Echo-Request/Reply support, and ICMP packets may
        encounter exceptional treatment on the measurement path (see
        Section&nbsp;2.6 of <xref target="RFC2681"></xref>). The Two-Way Active Measurement
        Protocol (TWAMP) specified in <xref target="RFC5357"></xref>
        establishes a round-trip packet loss measurement capability for the
        Internet. However, there is currently no round-trip packet loss metric
        specified according to the <xref target="RFC2330"></xref>
        framework.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC2681"></xref> indicates that round-trip
        measurements may sometimes encounter "asymmetric" paths. When loss is
        observed using a round-trip measurement, there is often a desire to
        ascertain which of the two directional paths "lost" the packet. Under
        some circumstances, it is possible to make this inference. The
        round-trip measurement method raises a few complications when
        interpreting the embedded one-way results, and the user should be
        aware of them.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC2681"></xref> also points out that loss
        measurement conducted sequentially in both directions of a path and
        reported as a round-trip result may be exactly the desired metric. On
        the other hand, it may be difficult to derive the state of round-trip
        packet loss from one-way measurements conducted in each direction
        unless a method to match the appropriate one-way measurements has been
        pre-arranged.</t>

        <t>Finally, many measurement systems report statistics on a
        conditional delay distribution, where the condition is packet arrival
        at the destination. This condition is encouraged in <xref
        target="RFC3393"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5481"></xref>, and
        <xref target="RFC6703"/>. As a result, lost packets need to
        be reported separately, according to a standardized metric. This memo
        defines such a metric.</t>

        <t>See Section 1.1 of <xref target="RFC2680"></xref> for additional
        motivation of the packet loss metric.</t>

        <t>We add the following guidance regarding the responder process to

        <t>A response that was not generated within Tmax is inadequate for any
        realistic test, and the Src will discard such responses. A responder
        that serves typical round-trip packet loss testing (which is relevant
        to higher-layer application performance) SHOULD produce a response in
        1 second or less. A responder that is unable to satisfy this
        requirement SHOULD log the fact so that an operator can adjust the
        load and priorities as necessary. Analysis of responder timestamps
        <xref target="RFC5357"></xref> that finds responses are not generated
        in a timely fashion SHOULD result in operator notification, and the
        operator SHOULD suspend tests to the responder, since it may be

      <t>Given the singleton metric Type-P-Round-trip-Loss, we now define one

      define a sample of values of parameter TstampSrc. This can be done in
      several ways, including the following:<list style="numbers">
          <t>Poisson: a pseudo-random Poisson process of rate lambda, whose
          values fall between T and Tf. The time interval between successive

          <t>Periodic: a periodic stream process with pseudo-random start time

        are reordered, and they are obviously not lost because they have
        arrived within some reasonable waiting time threshold. The presence of

      <t>This section raises considerations for results collected using a
      round-trip measurement architecture, such as in TWAMP <xref
      target="RFC5357"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The sampling process for the reverse path (Dst-&gt;Src) is a
      conditional process that depends on successful packet arrival at the Dst
      and correct operation at the Dst to generate the reflected packet.
      Therefore, the sampling process for the reverse path will be
      significantly affected when appreciable loss occurs on the Src-&gt;Dst
      path, making an attempt to assess the reverse path performance invalid
      (for loss or possibly any metric).</t>

      <t>Further, the sampling times for the reverse path (Dst-&gt;Src) are a
      random process that depends on the original sample times (TstampSrc),
      the one-way delay for successful packet arrival at the Dst, and time
      taken at the Dst to generate the reflected packet. Therefore, the
      sampling process for the reverse path will be significantly affected
      when appreciable delay variation occurs on the Src-&gt;Dst path, making
      an attempt to assess the reverse path performance invalid (for loss or
      possibly any metric).</t>

      <t>As discussed above in <xref target="sample-discuss"/>,
      packet reordering is always a
      possibility. In addition to the severe delay variation that usually
      accompanies it, reordering on the Src-&gt;Dst path will cause a
      misalignment of sequence numbers applied at the Dst when compared to
      the sender numbers. Measurement implementations MUST address this
      possible outcome.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Measurement Considerations and Calibration" anchor="meas-cons">
      <t>Prior to conducting this measurement, the participating hosts MUST be
      configured to send and receive test packets of the chosen Type-P.
      Standard measurement protocols are capable of this task <xref
      target="RFC5357"></xref>, but any reliable method is sufficient (e.g.,
      if the issues with ICMP discussed in Section 2.6 of <xref
      target="RFC2681"> </xref> can be alleviated, and the requirements of
      Sections <xref target="sing-def" format="counter"/>
      and <xref target="sing-discuss" format="counter"/> above are met,
      then ICMP could be used).</t>

      <t>Two key features of the host that receives test packets and returns
      them to the originating host are described in Section 4.2 of <xref
      target="RFC5357"></xref>. Every received test packet MUST result in a
      responding packet, and the response MUST be generated as quickly as
      possible. This implies that interface buffers will be serviced promptly
      and that buffer discards will be extremely rare. These features of the
      measurement equipment MUST be calibrated according to Section 3.7.3 of
      <xref target="RFC2679"></xref> when operating under a representative
      measurement load (as defined by the user). Both unexpected test packet
      discards, and the systematic and random errors and uncertainties, MUST
      be recorded.</t>

      <t>We note that Section 4.2.1 of <xref target="RFC5357"></xref>
      specifies a method to collect all four significant timestamps needed to
      describe a packet's round-trip delay <xref target="RFC2681"></xref> and
      remove the processing time incurred at the responding host. This
      information supports the measurement of the corresponding one-way delays
      encountered on the round-trip path, which can identify path asymmetry or
      unexpected processing time at the responding host.</t>

      <t></t>

      <section title="Denial-of-Service Attacks">
        <t>This metric requires a stream of packets sent from one host
        (source) to another host (destination) through intervening networks,
        and back. This method could be abused for denial-of-service attacks
        directed at the destination and/or the intervening network(s).</t>

        <t>Administrators of source, destination, and intervening
        network(s) should establish bilateral or multilateral agreements
        regarding the timing, size, and frequency of collection of sample
        metrics. Use of this method in excess of the terms agreed upon
        by the
        participants may be cause for immediate rejection or discard of
        packets, or other escalation procedures as defined between the affected
        parties.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="User Data Confidentiality">
        <t>Active use of this method generates packets for a sample, rather
        than taking samples based on user data, and does not threaten user
        data confidentiality. Passive measurement must restrict attention to
        the headers of interest. Since user payloads may be temporarily stored
        for length analysis, suitable precautions MUST be taken to keep this
        information safe and confidential. In most cases, a hashing function
        will produce a value suitable for payload comparisons.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Interference with the Metrics">
        <t>It may be possible to identify that a certain packet or stream of
        packets is part of a sample. With that knowledge at the destination
        and/or the intervening networks, it is possible to change the
        processing of the packets (e.g., increasing or decreasing delay) in a
        way that may distort the measured performance. It may also be possible
        to generate additional packets that appear to be part of the sample
        metric. These additional packets are likely to perturb the results of
        the sample measurement.</t>

        <t>Authentication or encryption techniques, such as digital
        signatures, MAY be used where appropriate to guard against injected
        traffic attacks. <xref target="RFC5357"></xref> includes both
        authentication and encryption features.</t>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>Metrics previously defined in the IETF were registered in the IANA
      IPPM Metrics Registry; however, this process was discontinued when the
      registry structure was found to be inadequate, and the registry was
      declared obsolete <xref target="RFC6248"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Although the metrics in this document may be considered for some form
      of registration in the future, no IANA action is requested at this
      time.</t>

    <section title="Acknowledgements">
      <t>The author thanks Tiziano Ionta for his careful review of this memo,
      primarily resulting in the development of measurement considerations
      using TWAMP <xref target="RFC5357"></xref> as an example method. The
      reviews of Adrian Farrel and Benoit Claise also contributed to the
      clarity of the memo.</t>
