    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the scope and set of requirements for the
      Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM) architecture, data
      model, and transfer protocols.
      The requirements and scope are based on the agreed-upon use cases
      described in RFC 7632.

         <section title="Introduction">
        <t> Today's environment of rapidly evolving security threats highlights the need to automate the sharing of security information (such as posture information) while protecting user information and the systems that store,
            process, and transmit this information.  Security threats can be detected
            in a number of ways. The Security Automation and Continuous
	    Monitoring (SACM) charter focuses on how to collect and share this
	    information based on use cases
            that involve posture assessment of endpoints.</t>
      
      <t> Scalable and sustainable collection, expression, and evaluation of endpoint information is foundational to SACM's objectives.  To secure and defend a network, one must reliably determine what devices are
          on the network, how those devices are configured from a hardware
          perspective, what software products are installed on those devices,
          and how those products are configured.  We need to be able to
          determine, share, and use this information in a secure, timely,
          consistent, and automated manner to perform endpoint posture
          assessments.</t>
      

      <t> This document focuses on describing the requirements for
      facilitating the exchange of posture assessment information in the
      enterprise, in particular, for the use cases as exemplified in <xref
      target="RFC7632"/>.</t> 

   <t>As proposals are evaluated for SACM standardization, the documents 
   describing each proposal are expected to include a section that 
   describes how the enumerated requirements are addressed.</t>
      <t> This document uses terminology defined in <xref target="TERMS"/>.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">

          <t>
              Use of each capitalized word within a sentence or phrase carries the
              following meaning during the SACM WG's protocol selection process:

    <section anchor="reqmts" title="Requirements">
        
       <t> This document defines requirements based on the SACM use cases described in <xref target="RFC7632"/>.
       This section describes the requirements used by SACM to assess and compare candidate data models, interfaces,
       and protocols.  These requirements express characteristics or features that a candidate
       protocol, information model, or data model must be capable of offering to ensure security and interoperability.</t>

       <t> Multiple data models, protocols, and transfers may be employed in a
       SACM environment. A SACM transfer protocol is one that runs on top of
       transport-layer protocols such as
       TCP/IP or internet-layer protocols such as
       HTTP, carries operations (requests/responses), and moves data. </t>

       <t> SACM will define an architecture and information model focused on
       addressing the needs for determining, sharing, and using posture
       information securely via posture information providers and posture
       information consumers.  With the information model defining assets and
       attributes to facilitate the guidance, collection, and assessment of
       posture, tasks that should be considered include: </t>
            <t><list hangIndent="1" style="numbers">
    
            <t>Asset Classification: Map the target endpoint and/or the assets on the target endpoints to asset classes.  This enables identification of the attributes needed to exchange information pertaining to the target endpoint. </t>
            
			<t>Attribute Definition: Define the attributes desired to be collected from each target endpoint.   For instance, organizations will want to know what software is installed and its critical security attributes such as patch level. </t>
            
            <t>Policy Definition: This is where an organization can express its policy for acceptable or problematic values of an endpoint attribute. The expected values of an endpoint attribute are determined for later comparison against the actual endpoint attribute values during the evaluation process. Expected values may include both values that are good as well as values that represent problems, such as vulnerabilities. The organization can also specify the endpoint attributes that are to be present for a given target endpoint.</t>

            <t>Information Collection: Collect information (attribute values) from the target endpoint to populate the endpoint data.</t>
    
            <t>Endpoint Assessment: Evaluate the actual values of the endpoint attributes against those expressed in the policy. (An evaluation result may become additional endpoint data.)</t>
    
            <t>Result Reporting: Report the results of the evaluation for use
	    by other components. Examples of the use of a report would be additional evaluation, network enforcement, vulnerability detection, and license management.</t>

            </list></t>

       <section anchor="general" title="Requirements for SACM">

           <t> Many deployment scenarios can be instantiated to address the
	   above tasks and the use cases defined in <xref target="RFC7632"/>. To ensure interoperability, scalability, and flexibility in any of these deployments, the following requirements are defined for proposed SACM standards:</t>

      <t><list hangIndent="1" style="hanging">
        

         <t hangText="G-001 (Solution Extensibility):"> The information model,
	 data models, protocols, and transfers defined
	 by SACM MUST be designed to allow support for future extensions.  SACM MUST allow for both standardized and proprietary
	 extensions. 

         <list hangIndent="1" style="numbers">
           
                <t> The information model and programmatic interfaces (see G-012 for one example) MUST support the ability to add new operations while maintaining backwards compatibility. SACM-defined transfer protocols MUST have extensibility to allow them to transfer operations that are defined in the future.</t>
                
                <t> The query language MUST allow for general inquiries as
		well as expression of specific attributes or relationships
		between attributes; the retrieval of specific information
		based on an event or on a continuous basis; and the ability to
		retrieve specific pieces of information, specific types or
		classes of information, or the entirety of available
		information.</t>
                
                <t> The information model MUST accommodate the interoperable addition of new data types and/or schemas.</t>
                
                </list></t>

         <t hangText="G-002 (Interoperability):"> The data models, protocols, and transports MUST be specified with enough details to ensure interoperability. </t>

         <t hangText="G-003 (Scalability):"> SACM needs to support a broad set of deployment scenarios. The data models, protocols, and transports have to be scalable unless they are specifically defined to apply to a special-purpose scenario, such as constrained devices.  A SACM transfer protocol standard SHOULD include a section on scalability considerations that addresses the number of endpoints and amount of information to which it can reasonably be expected to scale. Scalability must be addressed to support:

    <list style="symbols">
        <t> Large messages: It is possible that the size of posture assessment information can vary from a single assessment that is small in size to a very large message or a very large set of assessments (up to multiple gigabytes in size). </t>
        <t> Large number of messages per second: A deployment may involve many rapid or simultaneous events that require processing, generating many messages per second. </t>
        <t> Large number of providers and consumers: A deployment may consist of a very large number of endpoints requesting and/or producing posture assessment information. </t>
        <t> Large number of target endpoints: A deployment may be managing information of a very large number of target endpoints. </t>
        </list> </t>

        <t hangText="G-004 (Versatility):"> The data model, protocols, and transports must be suitably specified to enable implementations to fit into different deployment models and scenarios, including considerations for implementations of data models and transports operating in constrained environments. Separate solutions may be necessary to meet the needs of specific deployment models and scenarios.</t>
       
	   <t hangText="G-005 (Information Extensibility):"> Non-standard (implementation-specific) attributes MUST be supported. A method SHOULD be defined for preventing collisions from occurring in the naming of all attributes independent of their source. For interoperability and scope boundary, the information model MUST define the mandatory set of attributes.</t>
       
	   <t hangText="G-006 (Data Protection):"> To protect the information
	   being shared, SACM components MUST protect the integrity and
	   confidentiality of data in transit (end to end) and data at rest
	   (as information is stored in repositories).  Mechanisms for this
	   protection are unspecified but should include industry best
	   practices.  These mechanisms are required to be available (i.e.,
	   all data-handling components must support them) but are not
	   required to be used in all cases. </t>


        <t hangText="G-007 (Data Partitioning):"> A method for partitioning data MUST be supported to accommodate considerations such as geographic, regulatory, operational requirements, overlay boundaries, and federation (where the data may be collected in multiple locations and either centralized or kept in the local region). Where replication of data is supported, it is required that methods exist to prevent update loops.</t>
        
        <t hangText="G-008 (Versioning and Backward Compatibility):">
	Announcement and negotiation of versions, inclusive of existing
	capabilities (such as transfer protocols, data models, specific
	attributes within data models, standard attribute expression sets,
	etc.)&nbsp;MUST be supported.  Negotiation for both versioning and
	capabilities is needed to accommodate future growth and ecosystems
	with mixed capabilities. </t>

   
        <t hangText="G-009 (Information Discovery):"> There MUST be mechanisms
	for components to discover what information is available across the
	ecosystem (i.e., a method for cataloging data available in the
	ecosystem and advertising it to consumers), where to go to get a
	specific piece of that information (i.e., which provider has the
	information), and what schemas are in use for organizing the
	information. 

   For example, a method can be provided by which a node can locate the
   advertised information so that consumers are not required to have a
   priori knowledge to find available information.</t>

        <t hangText="G-010 (Target Endpoint Discovery):"> SACM MUST define the
	means by which target endpoints may be discovered.  The use case
	in Section 2.1.2 of <xref target="RFC7632"/> describes the need to
	discover endpoints and their composition. </t>

        <t hangText="G-011 (Push and Pull Access):"> Three methods of data
	access MUST be supported: a Pull model, a solicited Push model, and an
	unsolicited Push model. All of the methods of data access MUST
	support the ability for the initiator to filter the set of posture
	assessment information to be delivered. Additionally, the provider of
	the information MUST be able to filter the set of posture assessment
	information based on the permissions of the recipient. This
	requirement is driven by the use cases in Sections 2.1.3 and 2.1.4 of <xref
	target="RFC7632"/>.</t>
        
        <t hangText="G-012 (SACM Component Interface):"> The interfaces by which SACM components communicate to share endpoint posture information MUST be well defined. That is, the interface defines the data model, SACM transfer protocols, and network transfer protocols to enable SACM components to communicate.  </t>
            
        <t hangText="G-013 (Endpoint Location and Network Topology):"> The SACM architecture and interfaces MUST allow for the target endpoint (network) location and network topology to be modeled and understood.  Where appropriate, the data model and the interfaces SHOULD allow for discovery of the target endpoint location, network topology, or both. </t>
        
	<t hangText="G-014 (Target Endpoint Identity):"> The SACM architecture and interfaces MUST support the ability of components to provide attributes that can be used to compose an identity for a target endpoint. These identities MAY be composed of attributes from one or more SACM components.</t>
    
    <t hangText="G-015 (Data Access Control):"> Methods of access control must be supported to accommodate considerations such as geographic, regulatory, operational, and federations. Entities accessing or publishing data MUST identify themselves and pass access policy.</t>

             <section anchor="arch" title="Requirements for the Architecture">

<t> Following are the requirements for the SACM architecture: </t>
           <t><list hangIndent="1" style="hanging">
               <t hangText="ARCH-001 (Component Functions):"> At the simplest abstraction, the SACM architecture MUST represent the core components and interfaces needed to perform the production and consumption of posture assessment information. </t>

              
               <t hangText="ARCH-002 (Scalability):"> The architectural components MUST account for a range of deployments, from very small sets of endpoints to very large deployments.  </t>
               
               <t hangText="ARCH-003 (Flexibility):"> The architectural
	       components MUST account for different deployment scenarios
	       where the architectural components may be implemented,
	       deployed, or used within a single application, service, or
	       network, or may comprise a federated system. </t>
               
               <t hangText="ARCH-004 (Separation of Data and Management Functions):"> SACM MUST define both the configuration and management of the SACM data models and protocols used to transfer and share posture assessment information.</t>
               
               <t hangText="ARCH-005 (Topology Flexibility):"> Both centralized
	       and decentralized (peer-to-peer) information exchange MUST be
	       supported.  Centralized data exchange enables use of a common
	       data format to bridge together data exchange between diverse
	       systems and can leverage a virtual data store that centralizes
	       and offloads all data access, storage, and maintenance to a
	       dedicated resource. Decentralized data exchange enables
	       simplicity of sharing data between relatively uniform systems
	       and between small numbers of systems, especially within a
	       single enterprise domain. The fact that a centralized or
	       decentralized deployment is used SHOULD be invisible to a
	       consumer. However, there may be cases where the producer
	       chooses
                   to include that information due to consumer preference.</t>
               
               <t hangText="ARCH-006 (Capability Negotiation):"> Announcement and negotiation of functional capabilities (such as authentication protocols, authorization schemes, data models, transfer protocols, etc.) MUST be supported, enabling a SACM component to make inquiries about the capabilities of other components in the SACM ecosystem.</t>
               
        <t hangText="ARCH-007 (Role-Based Authorization):"> The SACM architecture MUST be capable of effecting role-based authorization. Distinction of endpoints capable of and authorized to provide or consume information is required to address appropriate access controls.</t>
               
 
               <t hangText="ARCH-008 (Context-Based Authorization):"> The SACM architecture MUST be capable of effecting context-based authorization.  Different policies (e.g., business, regulatory, etc.) might specify what data may be exposed to, or shared by, consumers based on one or more attributes of the consumer. The policy might specify that consumers are required to share specific information either back to the system or to administrators. </t>
               
               <t hangText="ARCH-009 (Time Synchronization):"> Actions or decisions based on time-sensitive data (such as user logon/logoff, endpoint connection/disconnection, endpoint behavior events, etc.) are all predicated on a synchronized understanding of time. The SACM architecture MUST provide a mechanism for all components to synchronize time. A mechanism for detecting and reporting time discrepancies SHOULD be provided by the architecture and reflected in the information model. </t>

        <t><list hangIndent="1" style="hanging">

            <t hangText="IM-001 (Extensible Attribute Vocabulary):"> The

	    communicating posture information, to ensure interoperability
	    between data models. (Individual data models may define attributes
	    beyond the mandatory-to-implement minimum set.) The attributes
	    should be defined with a clear mechanism for extensibility to
	    enable data models to adhere to SACM's required attributes as well
	    as allow for their own extensions. The attribute vocabulary should
	    be defined with a clear mechanism for extensibility to enable

	    expanded with new attributes.</t>

            
            <t hangText="IM-002 (Posture Data Publication):"> The information model MUST allow for the data to be provided by a SACM component either solicited or unsolicited. No aspect of the information model should be dependent upon or assume a Push or Pull model of publication. </t>
            
            <t hangText="IM-003 (Data Model Negotiation):"> SACM's information model MUST allow support for different data models, data model versions, and different versions of the operations on the data models and transfer protocols.

For example, endpoint identification could be an independent subcomponent of the information model, to simplify updating of endpoint identification attributes.</t>

A SACM data model MUST be derived from the SACM information model. A SACM data model consists of a set of SACM data model elements. In this derivation, a SACM data model element MAY map to one or more SACM information model elements.

	  structured either as one single module or separated into modules and
	  submodules that allow for references between them. The data model
	  structure MAY reflect structure in the information model but does
	  not need to. For example, the data model might use one module to
	  define endpoints, and that module might reference other modules that
	  describe the various assets associated with the

          <t hangText="DM-005 (Loose Coupling):"> The data model SHOULD allow for a loose coupling between the provider and the consumer, such that the consumer can request information without being required to request it from a specific provider, and a provider can publish information without having a specific consumer targeted to receive it.</t>

          <t hangText="DM-006 (Data Cardinality):"> The data model MUST describe

    As posture information and the

    for such cardinality and for conditional, optional, or mandatory
    attributes.

	  attribute dictionary. With SACM's scope focused on posture
	  assessment, the data model attribute collection and aggregation MUST
	  have a well-understood set of attributes inclusive of their meaning
	  or usage intent. The data model MUST include all attributes defined

	  requirements are requirements on the transfer protocol carrying the
	  requests and responses.
              The specific requirements for such operations include: </t>
          
          <t><list hangIndent="1" style="hanging">

          <t hangText="OP-001 (Time Synchronization):"> Request and response operations MUST be timestamped, and published information SHOULD capture time of publication. Actions or decisions based on time-sensitive data (such as user logon/logoff, endpoint connection/disconnection, endpoint behavior events, etc.) are all predicated on a synchronized understanding of time. A method for detecting and reporting time discrepancies SHOULD be provided.</t>
          
          <t hangText="OP-002 (Collection Abstraction):"> Collection is the act
	  of a SACM component gathering data from a target endpoint. The
	  request for a data item MUST include enough information to properly
	  identify the item to collect, but the request shall not be a command
	  to directly execute nor be directly applied as arguments to a
	  command. The purpose of this requirement is primarily to reduce the
	  potential attack vectors but has the additional benefit of
	  abstracting the request for collection from the collection method,
	  thereby allowing more flexibility in how collection is
	  implemented.</t>

          
          <t hangText="OP-003 (Collection Composition):"> A collection request
	  MAY be composed of multiple collection requests (which yield
	  collected values). The desire for multiple values MUST be expressed
	  as part of the collection request, so that the aggregation can be resolved at the point of collection without having to interact with the requestor. This requirement should not be interpreted as preventing a collector from providing attributes that were not part of the original request. </t>
          
          <t hangText="OP-004 (Attribute-Based Query):"> A query operation is
	  the act of requesting data from a provider. Query operations SHOULD
	  be based on a set of attributes. Query operations MUST support both
	  a query for specific attributes and a query for all attributes. The
	  use case in Section 2.1.2 of <xref target="RFC7632"/> describes the need for the data model to support a query operation based on a set of attributes to facilitate collection of information such as posture assessment, inventory (of endpoints or endpoint components), and configuration checklist.</t>
          
          <t hangText="OP-005 (Information-Based Query with Filtering):"> The
	  query operation MUST support filtering. The use case in
	  Section 2.1.3 of <xref target="RFC7632"/> describes the need for the data model to support the means for the information to be collected through a query mechanism. Furthermore, the query operation requires filtering capabilities to allow for only a subset of information to be retrieved. The query operation MAY be a synchronous request or asynchronous request.</t>
          
          <t hangText="OP-006 (Operation Scalability):"> The operation resulting
	  from a query operation MUST be able to handle the return and receipt
	  of large amounts of data. The use case in Section 2.1.4 of <xref target="RFC7632"/> describe the need for the data model to support scalability. For example, the query operation may result in a very large set of attributes as well as a large set of targets.</t>
          
          <t hangText="OP-007 (Data Abstraction):"> The data model MUST allow a
	  SACM component to communicate what data was used to construct the
	  target endpoint's identity, so that other SACM components can determine whether they are constructing an equivalent target endpoint (and its identity) and whether they have confidence in that identity. SACM components SHOULD have interfaces defined to transmit this data directly or to refer to where the information can be retrieved.</t>

          <t hangText="OP-008 (Provider Restriction):"> Request operations MUST include the ability to restrict the data to be provided by a specific provider or a provider with specific characteristics. Response operations MUST include the ability to identify the provider that supplied the response. For example, a SACM consumer should be able to request that all of the data come from a specific provider by identity (e.g., Provider A) or from a provider that is in a specific location (e.g., in the Boston office).</t>

          <t>The term "SACM
              transfer protocol" is intended to be distinguished from underlying
              transport- and internet-layer protocols such as TCP/IP or
	      operating at an application-layer protocol such as HTTP. The SACM transfer
              protocol is focused on moving data and performing necessary access
              control operations; it is agnostic to the data model operations.</t>
		 
		 <t>The requirements for SACM transfer protocols include: </t>
      
      <t><list hangIndent="1" style="hanging">

        <t hangText="T-001 (Multiple Transfer Protocol Support):"> SACM transfer protocols
    will vary depending on the deployment model that relies on
    different transfer-layer requirements, different device
    capabilities, and system configurations dealing with connectivity.

        For example, where posture attributes may be collected directly from
	an endpoint using the Network Endpoint Assessment (NEA) model  <xref target="RFC5209"/>,
            different transports may be defined to collect them using
Posture Transport Protocol for Extensible Authentication Protocol Tunnel
Methods (PT-EAP) <xref
	    target="RFC7171"/> or Posture Transport Protocol over TLS (PT-TLS) <xref target="RFC6876"/>,
            depending on the deployment scenario.</t>

           <t hangText="T-002 (Data Integrity):"> SACM transfer protocols MUST be able to ensure data integrity for data in transit.</t>
           
           <t hangText="T-003 (Data Confidentiality):"> SACM transfer protocols MUST be able to support data confidentiality. SACM transfer protocols MUST ensure data protection for data in transit (e.g., by encryption) to provide confidentiality, integrity, and robustness against protocol-based attacks. Note that while the transfer MUST be able to support data confidentiality, implementations MAY provide a configuration option that enables and disables confidentiality in deployments. Protection for data at rest is not in scope for transfer protocols. Data protection MAY be used for both privacy and non-privacy scenarios. </t>
           
           <t hangText="T-004 (Transfer Protection):"> SACM transfer protocols MUST be capable of supporting mutual authentication and replay protection. </t>
               
               <t hangText="T-005 (Transfer Reliability):"> SACM transfer
	       protocols MUST provide reliable delivery of data.  This
	       includes the ability to perform fragmentation and reassembly
	       and to detect replays. The SACM transfer may take advantage of
	       reliability features in the network transport; however, the
	       network transport may be unreliable (e.g., UDP), in which case
	       the SACM transfer running over the unreliable network transport
	       is responsible for ensuring reliability (i.e., by provisions
	       such as confirmations and retransmits).</t>

               
           <t hangText="T-006 (Transfer-Layer Requirements):"> Each SACM transfer protocol MUST clearly specify the transport-layer requirements it needs to operate correctly. Examples of items that may need to be specified include connectivity requirements, replay requirements, data link encryption requirements, and/or channel-binding requirements. These requirements are needed in order for deployments to be done correctly. </t>
          <t hangText="T-007 (Transfer Protocol Adoption):"> SACM SHOULD, where reasonably possible, leverage and use existing IETF transfer protocols versus defining new ones. </t>

          </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
	<t>This document defines the requirements for SACM.  As such, it is
	expected that several data models, protocols, and transfer protocols
	may be defined or reused from already-existing standards.  </t>

    
    <t> To address security and privacy considerations, the data model,
    protocols, and transports must consider authorization based on consumer
    function and privileges, to only allow authorized consumers and providers
    to access specific information being requested or published.</t>

   <t>To enable federation across multiple entities (such as across
   organizational or geographic boundaries), authorization must also
   extend to infrastructure elements themselves, such as central
   controllers, brokers, and data repositories.</t>
    
    <t>In addition, authorization needs to extend to specific information or resources available in the environment. In other words, authorization is based on the subject (the information requestor), the provider (the information responder), the object (the endpoint the information is being requested on), and the attribute (what piece of data is being requested). The method by which this authorization is applied is unspecified.</t>

    <t>SACM's charter focuses on the workflow orchestration and the sharing of
    posture information for improving the efficacy of security applications
    such as compliance, configuration, assurance, and other threat and
    vulnerability reporting and remediation systems.  While the goal is to facilitate the flow of information securely, it is important to note that participating endpoints may not be cooperative or trustworthy.</t>
    
    <section anchor="Trust" title="Trust between Provider and Requestor">
        <t> The information given from the provider to a requestor may come
	with different levels of trustworthiness given the different potential
	deployment scenarios and compromise at the provider, the requesting
	consumer, or devices that are involved in the transfer between the
	provider and requestor.  This section will describe the different
	considerations that may reduce the level of trustworthiness of the
	information provided.</t>

        
        <t> In the information transfer flow, it is possible that some of the devices may serve as proxies or brokers and, as such, may be able to observe the communications flowing between an information provider and requestor. Without appropriate protections, it is possible for these proxies and brokers to inject and affect man-in-the-middle attacks.</t>
    
        <t>In general, it is common to distrust the network service provider, unless the full hop-by-hop communications process flow is well understood.  As such, the posture information provider should protect the posture information data it provides as well as the transfer it uses. Similarly, while there may be providers whose goal is to openly share its information, there may also be providers whose policy is to grant access to certain posture information based on its business or regulatory policy.  In those situations, a provider may require full authentication and authorization of the requestor (or set of requestors) and share only the authorized information to the authenticated and authorized requestors.</t>
        
        <t>Beyond distrusting the network service provider, a requestor must
	also take into account that the information received from the provider may have been communicated through an undetermined network communications system.
            That is, the posture information may have traversed through many
	devices before reaching the requestor.  SACM specifications should
	provide the means for verifying data origin and data integrity and, at
	minimum, provide endpoint authentication and transfer integrity.</t>
        
        <t> A requestor may require data freshness indications, both knowledge
	of data origination as well as time of publication, so that it can make
	more informed decisions about the relevance of the data based on its
	currency and/or age. </t>

        
        <t> It is also important to note that endpoint assessment reports,
	especially as they may be provided by the target endpoint, may pose
	untrustworthy information.  The considerations for this are described
	in Section 8 of <xref target="RFC5209"/>. </t>
        
        <t> The trustworthiness of the posture information given by the provider to one or many requestors is dependent on several considerations.  Some of these include the requestor requiring: </t>
        
            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t> Full disclosure of the network topology path to the provider(s).</t>
                <t> Direct (peer-to-peer) communication with the provider.</t>
                <t> Authentication and authorization of the provider.</t>
                <t> Either or both confidentiality and integrity at the transfer layer. </t>
                <t> Either or both confidentiality and integrity at the data layer.</t>
            </list> </t>

        </section>
    <section anchor="Privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">
        <t>SACM information may contain sensitive information about the target
	endpoint as well as revealing identity information of the producer or
	consumer of such information.  

   Similarly, as part of the SACM
   discovery mechanism, the capabilities and roles (e.g.,
   SACM components enabled) advertised by the endpoint may be construed as
   private information.</t>
        <t>In addition to identity and SACM capabilities information disclosure, the use of timestamps (or other attributes that can be used as identifiers) could be further used to determine a target endpoint or user's behavioral patterns. Such attributes may also be deemed sensitive and may require further protection or obfuscation to meet privacy concerns. That is, there may be applications as well as business and regulatory practices that require that aspects of such information be hidden from any parties that do not need to know it. </t>
        <t> Data confidentiality can provide some level of privacy but may
	fall short where unnecessary data is still transmitted.  In those
	cases, filtering requirements at the data model such as OP-005 must be
	applied to ensure that such data is not disclosed.  <xref
	target="RFC6973"/> provides guidelines that SACM protocols,
	information models, and data models should follow.</t>
