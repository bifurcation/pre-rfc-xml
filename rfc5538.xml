        This memo specifies the 'news' and
        'nntp' Uniform Resource Identifier
        (URI) schemes that were originally defined in RFC 1738.
        The purpose of this document is to allow RFC 1738
        to be made obsolete while keeping the information about these
        schemes on the Standards Track.
    </t></abstract>


</front><middle>

<section title="Introduction"><t>
    The first definition for many URI schemes appears in
    <xref target="RFC1738" />.  This memo extracts the
    'news' and 'nntp' URI schemes from it to allow that material to
    remain on the Standards Track
    if <xref target="RFC1738" /> is moved to &quot;historic&quot; status.
    It belongs to a series of similar documents like
    <xref target="RFC4156" />,
    <xref target="RFC4157" />,
    <xref target="RFC4248" />, and
    <xref target="RFC4266" />, which are discussed on the
    <eref target="mailto:uri@w3.org" /> list.

</t><t>
    The definitions for the 'news' and
    'nntp' URI schemes given here are
    updates from <xref target="RFC1738" /> based on modern usage of these
    schemes. This memo intentionally limits its description of the 'news'
    URI scheme to essential features supposed to work with "any browser"
    and Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) server.
</t><t>
    <xref target="RFC3986" /> specifies how to define schemes for URIs;
    it also explains the term "Uniform Resource Locator" (URL).
    The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) is specified in
    <xref target="RFC3977" />. The Netnews Article
    Format is defined in <xref target="RFC5536" />.

</t><t>
    The key word "MUST" in this memo is to be interpreted as described in
    <xref target="RFC2119" />.  UTF-8 is specified in
    <xref target="RFC3629" />.  The syntax uses the ABNF defined in
    <xref target="RFC5234" />.

</t></section>

<section title="Background"><t>
    The 'news' and 'nntp'
    URI schemes identify resources on an NNTP server, individual articles,
    individual newsgroups, or sets of newsgroups.

</t><t>
    User agents like Web browsers supporting these schemes use the NNTP
    protocol to access the corresponding resources. The details of how they
    do this, e.g., employing a separate or integrated newsreader, depend
    on the implementation. The default &lt;port&gt;
    associated with NNTP in <xref target="RFC3977" /> is 119.

</t><section title="'nntp' URIs"><t>
    The 'nntp' URI scheme identifies articles in
    a newsgroup on a specific NNTP server.  In <xref target="RFC3986" />
    terminology, this means that 'nntp' URIs have a
    non-empty &lt;authority&gt; component; there is no default &lt;host&gt;
    as for the 'file' or 'news' URI schemes.

</t><t>
    Netnews is typically distributed among several news servers, using the
    same newsgroup names but local article numbers.  An article available
    as number 10 in group <spanx style="verb">example</spanx>
    on server <spanx style="verb">news.example.com</spanx> has most likely
    a different number on any other server where the same article is still
    available. Users allowed to read and post articles on "their" server
    may not be allowed to access articles on an "arbitrary" server
    specified in an 'nntp' URI.

</t><t>
    For these reasons, the use of the 'nntp' URI
    scheme is limited, and it is less widely supported by user agents than
    the similar 'news' URI scheme.

</t></section><section title="'news' URIs" anchor="disambiguation"><t>
    The 'news' URI scheme identifies articles by
    their worldwide unique <spanx style="verb">Message-ID</spanx>, independent
    of the server and the newsgroup.  Newsreaders support access to articles by
    their <spanx style="verb">Message-ID</spanx>, without the
    overhead of a URI scheme. In simple cases, they do this directly
    as an NNTP client of a default or currently used server as configured by the user.
    More general user agents use the 'news' URI
    scheme to distinguish <spanx style="verb">Message-IDs</spanx> from similar
    constructs such as other URI schemes in contexts such as a plain text message
    body.

</t><t>
    The 'news' URI scheme also allows the identification of
    newsgroups or sets of newsgroups independent of a specific server. For
    Netnews, a group <spanx style="verb">example</spanx> has the same name
    on any server carrying this group, exotic cases involving gateways
    notwithstanding. To distinguish <spanx style="verb">Message-IDs</spanx> and
    newsgroup names, the 'news' URI scheme relies on the
    <spanx style="verb">@</spanx> between local part (left-hand side) and
    domain part (right-hand side) of <spanx style="verb">Message-IDs</spanx>.

</t><t>
    <xref target="RFC1738" /> offered only one wildcard for sets of newsgroups
    in 'news' URIs, a <spanx style="verb">*</spanx>
    used to refer to "all available newsgroups". In common practice, this was
    extended to varying degrees by different user agents.  An NNTP extension known
    as &lt;wildmat&gt;, specified in <xref target="RFC2980" />
    and now part of the base NNTP specification, allows pattern matching in
    the style of the <xref target="POSIX" />
    <spanx style="verb">find</spanx> command. For the
    purpose of this memo, this means that some additional special characters
    have to be allowed in 'news' URIs, some of them
    percent-encoded as required by the overall <xref target="RFC3986" /> URI
    syntax. User agents and NNTP servers not yet compliant with
    <xref target="RFC3977" /> do not implement all parts of this new feature.

</t><t>
    Another commonly supported addition to the <xref target="RFC1738" />
    syntax is the optional specification of a server at the beginning of
    'news' URIs. This optional
    &lt;authority&gt; component follows the overall
    <xref target="RFC3986" /> syntax, preceded by a double slash
    <spanx style="verb">//</spanx> and terminated by the next slash
    <spanx style="verb">/</spanx>, question mark
    <spanx style="verb">?</spanx>, number sign
    <spanx style="verb">#</spanx>, or the end of the URI.

</t></section><section title="Query Parts, Fragments, and Normalization"><t>
    Fragments introduced by a number sign <spanx style="verb">#</spanx>
    are specified in <xref target="RFC3986" />; the semantics is
    independent of the URI scheme, and the resolution depends on the media
    type.

</t><t>
    This memo doesn't specify a query part introduced by a question mark
    <spanx style="verb">?</spanx>
    for the 'news' and 'nntp' URI schemes, but some implementations are
    known to use query parts instead of fragments internally to address
    parts of a composite media type <xref target="RFC2046" /> in
    Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME).

</t><t>
    There are no special <spanx style="verb">.</spanx> or
    <spanx style="verb">..</spanx> path segments in
    'news' and 'nntp'
    URLs.  Please note that <spanx style="verb">.</spanx> and
    <spanx style="verb">..</spanx> are not valid &lt;newsgroup-name&gt;s.

</t><t>
    URI producers have to percent-encode some characters as specified
    <xref target="news">below</xref>;
    otherwise, they MUST treat a <spanx style="verb">Message-ID</spanx>
    without angle brackets for 'news' URLs as is,
    i.e.,&nbsp;case-sensitive.

</t></section></section>

<section title="Syntax of 'nntp' URIs"><t>
    An 'nntp' URI identifies an article by its
    number in a given newsgroup on a specified server, or it identifies
    the newsgroup without article number.

</t><figure><artwork type="abnf">
    nntpURL         = "nntp:" server "/" group [ "/" article-number ]
    server          = "//" authority               ; see RFC 3986
    group           = 1*( group-char / pct-encoded )
    article-number  = 1*16DIGIT                    ; see RFC 3977
    group-char      = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "+" / "_" / "."
</artwork></figure><t>

    In the form with an &lt;article-number&gt;, the URL corresponds roughly
    to the content of an &lt;xref&gt; header field as specified in
    <xref target="RFC5536" />, replacing its more general
    &lt;article&nbhy;locator&gt; by the &lt;article&nbhy;number&gt; used
    with the NNTP.

</t><t>
    A &lt;newsgroup-name&gt; as specified in
    <xref target="RFC5536" />
    consists of dot-separated components.  Each
    component contains one or more letters, digits,
    <spanx style="verb">-</spanx> (hyphen-minus),
    <spanx style="verb">+</spanx>, or
    <spanx style="verb">_</spanx> (underscore).  These characters can be
    directly used in a segment of a path in an <xref target="RFC3986" />
    URI; no percent-encoding is necessary.  Example:

</t><figure><artwork>
    nntp://news.server.example/example.group.this/12345
</artwork></figure><t>

    A &lt;wildmat-exact&gt; newsgroup name as specified in
    <xref target="RFC3977" />
    allows (in theory) any &lt;UTF8-non-ascii&gt;
    (see <xref target="i18n" />)
    and most printable
    US&nbhy;ASCII characters, excluding
    <spanx style="verb">!</spanx>,
    <spanx style="verb">*</spanx>,
    <spanx style="verb">,</spanx>,
    <spanx style="verb">?</spanx>,
    <spanx style="verb">[</spanx>,
    <spanx style="verb">\</spanx>, and
    <spanx style="verb">]</spanx>.
    However, <xref target="RFC5536" /> does not (yet) permit
    characters outside of &lt;group-char&gt; and so, to keep the syntax
    simple, the additional characters are here covered by &lt;pct-encoded&gt;
    as defined in <xref target="RFC3986" />, since most of them have to be
    percent-encoded anyway (with a few exceptions, such as
    <spanx style="verb">:</spanx>,
    <spanx style="verb">;</spanx>, and <spanx style="verb">~</spanx>).
    Example:

</t><figure><artwork>
    nntp://wild.server.example/example.group.n%2Fa/12345
</artwork></figure><t>

    In the form without &lt;article-number&gt;, the URL identifies a single
    group on the specified server.  This is also possible with an equivalent
    'news' URL, and the latter is better supported
    by user agents. Example:

</t><?rfc needLines="3" ?><figure><artwork>
    nntp://news.server.example/example.group.this
    news://news.server.example/example.group.this
</artwork></figure></section>

<section title="Syntax of 'news' URIs" anchor="news"><t>
    A 'news' URI identifies an article by its
    unique <spanx style="verb">Message-ID</spanx>, or it identifies a
    set of newsgroups.  Additionally, it can specify a server; when the
    server is not specified, a configured default server for Netnews access is used.


</t><figure><artwork type="abnf">
    newsURL         = "news:" [ server "/" ] ( article / newsgroups )
    article         = msg-id-core                  ; see RFC 5536
</artwork></figure><t>
    The form identifying an &lt;article&gt; is the
    &lt;msg-id-core&gt; from
    <xref target="RFC5536" />; it is a
    <spanx style="verb">Message-ID</spanx> without angle brackets.
According to <xref target="RFC3986" />, characters that are in
&lt;gen-delims&gt; (a subset of &lt;reserved&gt;), together with the
character "%", MUST be percent-encoded (though it is not wrong to encode
others). Specifically, the characters allowed in &lt;msg-id-core&gt;
that must  be encoded are

</t><figure><artwork>
    "/"  "?"  "#"  "[" "]" and "%"
</artwork></figure><t>

Note that an agent which seeks to interpret a 'news' URI needs to
decode all percent-encoded characters before passing it on to an
NNTP server to be acted upon.

</t><t>
    Please note that
    <spanx style="verb">%3E</spanx> (<spanx style="verb">&gt;</spanx>)
    is not allowed; &lt;msg-id-core&gt; is otherwise identical to
<figure><artwork>
        id-left "@" id-right
</artwork></figure>
as defined in <xref target="RFC5322" />.

</t><t>
    The form identifying &lt;newsgroups&gt; corresponds to the
    <xref target="RFC3977" /> &lt;wildmat&nbhy;pattern&gt;, a
    newsgroup name with wildcards <spanx style="verb">*</spanx> and
    <spanx style="verb">?</spanx>.  Any <spanx style="verb">?</spanx>
    has to be percent-encoded as <spanx style="verb">%3F</spanx>
    in this part of a URI.  Examples (the first two are equivalent):

</t><figure><artwork>
    news://news.server.example/*
    news://news.server.example/
    news://wild.server.example/example.group.th%3Fse
    news:example.group.*
    news:example.group.this
</artwork></figure><t>

    Without wildcards, this form of the URL identifies a single group
    if it is not empty.  User agents would typically try to present
    an overview of the articles available in this group, likely
    somehow limiting this overview to the newest unread articles up to
    a configured maximum.

</t><t>
    With wildcards, user agents could try to list matching group names
    on the specified or default server.  Some user agents support only
    a specific &lt;group&gt; without wildcards, or an optional single
    <spanx style="verb">*</spanx>.

</t><t>
    As noted <xref target="disambiguation">above</xref>,
    the presence of an <spanx style="verb">@</spanx>
    in a 'news' URI disambiguates &lt;article&gt; and &lt;newsgroups&gt;
    for URI consumers.  The new &lt;message-id&gt; construct specified
    in <xref target="RFC3977" /> does not require an
    <spanx style="verb">@</spanx>.  Since <xref target="RFC0822" />,
    the <spanx style="verb">Message-ID</spanx> syntax has been closely
    related to the syntax of mail addresses with an
    <spanx style="verb">@</spanx> separating left-hand side (local
    part of addresses, unique part of message identifiers) and
    right-hand side (domain part), and this memo sticks to the known
    <xref target="RFC1738" /> practice.

<section title="Acknowledgments"><t>
  Henry Spencer was the driving force to adopt MIME in Netnews; he
  registered the MIME 'message/external-body' access type
  'news&nbhy;message&nbhy;ID', discussed <xref target="mime">below</xref>, in 1993 as
  recalled in "Son-of-1036" <xref target="RFC1849" />.
</t><t>
    "The 'news' URL scheme" <xref target="GILMAN" />, by
    Alfred S. Gilman (March 1998), introduced additions
    to the original <xref target="RFC1738" /> 'news'
    URI scheme.  Some of these ideas are now widely supported and reflected by
    the revised 'news' URI scheme specified here.

<section title="Internationalization Considerations" anchor="i18n"><t>
    The URI schemes were updated to support percent-encoded UTF-8
    characters in NNTP newsgroup names as specified in
    <xref target="RFC3977" /> and <xref target="RFC3987" />.

</t><t>
    The Netnews Article Format in <xref target="RFC5536" />
    does not yet allow UTF-8 in &lt;newsgroup-name&gt;s; therefore,
    well-known Unicode and UTF-8 security considerations are not listed
    below.  For an overview, see <xref target="UTR36" /> and
    <xref target="RFC3629" />.

</t><t>
    The work on Email Address Internationalization (EAI), started in
    <xref target="RFC4952" />, is not expected to change the syntax of a
    <spanx style="verb">Message-ID</spanx>.

</t></section>

<section title="Security Considerations"><t>
    There are many security considerations for URI schemes discussed in
    <xref target="RFC3986" />.  The NNTP protocol may use passwords in the
    clear for authentication or offer no privacy, both of which are
    considered extremely unsafe in current practice.  Alternatives and
    further security considerations with respect to the NNTP are discussed
    in <xref target="RFC4642" /> and <xref target="RFC4643" />.

</t><t>
    The syntax for the 'news' and 'nntp' URI schemes contains the general
    &lt;authority&gt; construct with an optional &lt;userinfo&gt; defined
    in <xref target="RFC3986" />.  As noted in <xref target="RFC3986" />, the
    <spanx style="verb">user:password</spanx> form of a &lt;userinfo&gt;
    is deprecated.

</t><t>
    Articles on NNTP servers typically expire after some time.  After that
    time, corresponding 'news' and 'nntp' URLs may not work anymore depending
    on the server.  
While a <spanx style="verb">Message-ID</spanx> is
    supposed to be worldwide unique forever, the NNTP protocol does not
    guarantee this.  Under various conditions depending on the servers, the
    same <spanx style="verb">Message-ID</spanx> could be used for different
    articles, and attackers could try to distribute malicious content for
    known 'news' or 'nntp' URLs.

</t><t>
    If a URI does not match the generic syntax in <xref target="RFC3986" />,
    it is invalid, and broken URIs can cause havoc.
    Compare <xref target="RFC5064" /> for similar security
    considerations.

<section title="'news-message-ID' Access Type" anchor="mime"><t>
    The MIME 'news-message-ID' access type was erroneously listed as a
    subtype.  IANA has removed 'news-message-ID' from the application
    subtype registry, and has added it to the access types registry defined in
    <xref target="RFC4289" />.


</t><t>
    <xref target="RFC4289" /> requires an RFC (preferably on the Standards Track) for the access types
    registry. To provide a definition meeting this requirement, the following
paragraph is reproduced verbatim from <xref target="RFC1849" />:

<list><t>
    NOTE: In the specific case where it is desired to essentially
    make another article PART of the current one, e.g., for annotation
    of the other article, MIME's "message/external-body" convention can
    be used to do so without actual inclusion.  "news-message-ID" was
    registered as a standard external-body access method, with a
    mandatory NAME parameter giving the  message ID and an optional SITE
    parameter suggesting an NNTP site that might have the article available
    (if it is not available locally), by IANA 22 June 1993.

</t></list>
    Please note that 'news' URLs offer a very similar and (today)
    more common way to access articles by their Message-ID; compare
    <xref target="RFC2017" />.

    <section title="Detailed Example" anchor="gmane"><t>
        Here is an example of a mail to the
        <eref target="mailto:tools.discuss@ietf.org" />
        list with <spanx style="verb">Message-ID</spanx>
        &lt;p0624081dc30b8699bf9b@[10.20.30.108]&gt;.
    </t><t>
        <eref target="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.ietf.tools" />
        is one of the various list archives; it converts mail
        into Netnews articles. The header of this article
        contains the following fields (among others):
    </t><figure><artwork>
        Message-ID: &lt;p0624081dc30b8699bf9b@[10.20.30.108]&gt;
        Xref: news.gmane.org gmane.ietf.tools:742
        Archived-At: &lt;http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.ietf.tools/742&gt;
    </artwork></figure><t>
        The <spanx style="verb">Xref</spanx>
        roughly indicates the 742nd article in newsgroup
        <eref target="news://news.gmane.org/gmane.ietf.tools" />
        on this server.  An 'nntp' URL might be
        <eref target="nntp://news.gmane.org/gmane.ietf.tools/742" />.
        For details about the <spanx style="verb">Archived-At</spanx>
        URL, see <xref target="RFC5064" />.
    </t><t>
        The list software and list subscribers reading the
        list elsewhere can't predict a server-specific article
        number 742 in this archive.  If they know this server,
        they can however guess the corresponding
        <eref target="news://news.gmane.org/p0624081dc30b8699bf9b@%5B10.20.30.108%5D" />
        URL.
    </t><t>
        In theory, the list software could use the guessed 'news' URL
        in an <spanx style="verb">Archived-At</spanx> header field, but
        if a list tries this, it would likely use
        <eref target="http://mid.gmane.org/p0624081dc30b8699bf9b@%5B10.20.30.108%5D" />.
    </t><t>
        Using domain literals in a <spanx style="verb">Message-ID</spanx>
        could cause collisions.  A collision might force the mail2news
        gateway in this example to invent a new
        <spanx style="verb">Message-ID</spanx>, and an attempt to guess
        the future URL on this server would then fail.
