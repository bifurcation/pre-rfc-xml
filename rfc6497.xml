            This document specifies an Extension to BCP 47
            that provides subtags for specifying the source
            language or script of transformed content, including
            content that has been transliterated, transcribed, or
            translated, or in some other way influenced by the source.
            It also provides for additional information used for
            identification.

             permits the definition and registration of language tag extensions
             "that contain a language component and are compatible with
             applications that
             understand language tags". This document defines an
             extension for
             specifying the source of content that has been transformed,
             including text that has been transliterated, transcribed, or
             translated, or in some other way influenced by the source.
             It may be used in queries to request content that has been
             transformed.
             The "singleton" identifier for this extension is 't'.
          </t>

          <t>
             Language tags, as defined by
             <xref target="BCP47"></xref>, are useful for identifying the language of content.
             There are
             mechanisms for specifying variant subtags for special purposes.
             However, these variants are insufficient for specifying content that has
             undergone transformations, including content that has been
             transliterated, transcribed, or translated.
             The correct interpretation of the content may depend upon knowledge of the conventions used for the transformation.
          </t>

             <t>
                Suppose that Italian or Russian
                cities on a map are transcribed for Japanese users. Each name
needs to be
                transliterated into katakana using rules appropriate for the
specific
                source and target language.   When tagging such data, it is
important
                to be able to indicate not only the resulting content language
("ja"
                in this case), but also the source language.</t>

                     <t>Transforms such as transliterations may vary, depending
not only on the
                basis of the source and target script, but also on the source and target language.
                Thus, the
                Russian &lt;U+041F U+0443 U+0442 U+0438 U+043D> (which corresponds to
                the Cyrillic &lt;PE, U, TE, I, EN>) transliterates into "Putin" in
                English but "Poutine" in French.  The identifier could be used to indicate
                a desired mechanical transformation in an API, or could be used to tag
                data that has been converted (mechanically or by hand) according to a
                transliteration method.</t>
                <t>
                In addition, many different conventions have arisen for how to transform text, even between the same languages and scripts.
                For example, "Gaddafi" is commonly transliterated from Arabic to English as any of (G/Q/K/Kh)a(d/dh/dd/dhdh/th/zz)af(i/y).
                Some examples of  standardized conventions used for transcribing or transliterating text include:
                <list style="letters">
             <t>United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names (UNGEGN)</t>
             <t>US Library of Congress (LOC)</t>
             <t>US Board on Geographic Names (BGN)</t>
             <t>Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (MCST)</t>

                  </list>
                </t>
                <t>The usage of this extension is not limited to formal transformations, 
                and may include other instances where the content is in some other way influenced by the source. 
                For example, this extension could be used to designate a request for a speech recognizer 
                that is tailored specifically for second-language speakers who are 
                first-language speakers of a particular language (e.g., a recognizer for "English spoken with a Chinese accent").</t>

            <section title="Overview">
                <t>
             Identification of transformed content can be done using the 't' extension
             defined in this document.
             This extension is formed by the 't'
             singleton followed by a sequence of subtags that would form a
             language tag as defined by
             <xref target="BCP47"></xref>.
             This allows the source language or script to be specified to
             the degree of precision required.
             There are restrictions on the
             sequence of subtags.
             They MUST form a regular, valid, canonical
             language
             tag, and MUST neither include extensions nor private use
             sequences introduced by the
             singleton
             'x'.
             Where only the script is
             relevant (such as identifying
             a
             script-script
             transliteration), then
             'und' is used for the primary language subtag.
                </t>
                <t>For example:</t>
                <texttable>
             <ttcol>Language Tag</ttcol>
        
             <ttcol>Description</ttcol>
        
             <c>ja-t-it</c>
        
             <c>The content is Japanese, transformed from Italian.</c>
        
             <c>ja-Kana-t-it</c>
        
             <c>The content is Japanese Katakana, transformed from Italian.</c>
        
             <c>und-Latn-t-und-cyrl</c>
        
             <c>The content is in the Latin script, transformed from the Cyrillic
                     script.</c>
        
                </texttable>
                <t>
             Note that the sequence of subtags governed by 't' cannot contain a
             singleton (a single-character subtag), because that would start a
             new extension. For example, the tag "ja-t-i-ami"
             does not indicate
             that the source is in "i-ami", because "i-ami" is not a
             regular language tag in
             <xref target="BCP47"></xref>. That tag would express
             an empty 't' extension followed by an 'i' extension.
                </t>
                <t>The 't' extension is not intended for use in structured data that already provides 
                separate source and target language identifiers.
                For example, this is the case in localization interchange formats such as XLIFF.
                In such cases, it would be inappropriate to use "ja&nbhy;t-it" for the target language tag because the source language tag
                "it" would already be present in the data. Instead, one would use the language tag "ja".
                </t>
                <t>As noted earlier, it is sometimes necessary to indicate additional
             information about a transformation.
             This additional information is optionally supplied after the source in a series of one or more fields,
             where each field consists of a field separator subtag followed by one or more non-separator subtags.
             Each field separator subtag consists of a single letter followed by a single digit.
             </t>
                <t>A transformation mechanism is an optional field that indicates
             the
             specification used for the transformation, such as "UNGEGN" for
             the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names
             transliterations and transcriptions. It uses the 'm0' field separator followed by certain subtags.
                </t>
                <t>For example:</t>
                <texttable>
             <ttcol>Language Tag</ttcol>
        
             <ttcol>Description</ttcol>
        
             <c>und-Cyrl-t-und-latn-m0-ungegn-2007</c>
        
             <c>The content is in Cyrillic, transformed from Latin, according
                to a UNGEGN specification dated 2007.</c>
        
                </texttable>
             <t>The field separator subtags, such as 'm0',
             were chosen because they are
             short, visually distinctive,
             and cannot occur in a language subtag
             (outside of an extension and
             after 'x'), thus eliminating the
             potential for collision or confusion with the
             source language tag.</t>
                <t>
             The field subtags are defined by Section 3
             of <xref target="UTS35">Unicode Technical Standard #35:
             Unicode Locale Data Markup Language (LDML)</xref>,
             the main specification for the Unicode Common Locale Data
             Repository (CLDR) project. That section also defines
             the parallel 'u' extension <xref target="RFC6067"/>, for which
             the Unicode Consortium is also the maintaining authority.
             As required by BCP 47, subtags follow the language tag ABNF and
             other rules for the formation of language tags and subtags, are
             restricted to the ASCII letters and digits, are not case
             sensitive, and do not exceed eight characters in length.
                </t>

                <t>The LDML specification is available over the Internet and at
             no cost, and is available via a royalty-free license at
             http://unicode.org/copyright.html. LDML is versioned, and each
             version of LDML is numbered, dated, and stable. Extension subtags,

            <section title="Field Definitions" anchor="summary">
            <t>Assignment of 't' field subtags is determined by the Unicode
            CLDR Technical Committee, in accordance with the policies and
            procedures in http://www.unicode.org/consortium/tc-procedures.html,
            and subject to the Unicode Consortium Policies on
            http://www.unicode.org/policies/policies.html.</t>
                <t>
                    Assignments that can be made by successive versions of
                    <xref target="UTS35">LDML</xref>
                    by the Unicode Consortium without requiring a new RFC include:
                    <list style="symbols">
                    <t>The
                    allocation of new field separator subtags for use after the 't' extension.</t>
                    <t>The allocation of subtags valid after a field separator subtag.</t>
                    <t>The addition of subtag aliases and descriptions. </t>
                    <t>The modification of subtag descriptions.</t>
                    </list>
                    Changes to the syntax or meaning of the 't' extension would require a new 
                    RFC that obsoletes this document; such an RFC would break stability, and
                    would thus be contrary to the policies of the Unicode Consortium.
                </t>
                <t>
                  At the time this document was published, one field separator
                  subtag was specified in 
                  <xref target="UTS35"></xref>: the transform mechanism.
                  That field is summarized here:
             <list style="letters">
                     <t>
                             The transform mechanism consists of a sequence of
                             subtags
                             starting
                             with the 'm0' separator followed by one or more
                             mechanism subtags.
                             Each mechanism subtag has a length of 3 to 8
                             alphanumeric
                             characters.
                             The sequence as a whole provides an
                             identification of the
                             specification
                             for the transform,
                             such as the
                             mechanism subtag 'ungegn' in
                             "und-Cyrl-t-und-latn-m0-ungegn".
                             In
                             many cases, only one mechanism subtag is necessary, but
                             multiple
                             subtags MAY be defined in
                             <xref target="UTS35"></xref>
                             where necessary.
                     </t>
                     <t>
                             Any purely numeric subtag is a representation of a date in the
                             Gregorian calendar.
                             It MAY occur in any mechanism field, but it SHOULD only be used where necessary.
                             If it does occur:
                             <list style="symbols">
                     <t>it MUST occur as the final subtag in the field</t>
                     <t>it MUST NOT be the only subtag in the field</t>
                     <t>it MUST only consist of a sequence of digits of the form YYYY,
                             YYYYMM, or YYYYMMDD</t>
                <t>it SHOULD be as short as possible</t>
                             </list>
                             Note: The format is related to that of <xref target="RFC3339"></xref>, but is not the same.
                             The RFC 3339 full-date won't work because it uses hyphens. The offset ("Z") is not used
                             because the date is a publication date (aka 'floating date'). For more information, see
                              Section&nbsp;3.3 ("Floating Time") of 
                              <xref target="W3C-TimeZones"></xref>.
                              </t>
                             <t>
                             Examples:
                             <list style="symbols">
                             <t>20110623 represents June 23, 2011.</t>
                             <t>There are three dated versions of the UNGEGN transliteration
                 specification for Hebrew to Latin. They can be represented by the following language tags:
                 <list style="symbols">
                <t>und-Hebr-t-und-latn-m0-ungegn-1972</t>
                <t>und-Hebr-t-und-latn-m0-ungegn-1977</t>
                <t>und-Hebr-t-und-latn-m0-ungegn-2007</t>
                 </list>
                             </t>
                   <t>Suppose that the BGN transliteration
                      specification for Cyrillic to Latin had three versions,
                      dated June 11, 1999; Dec&nbsp;30, 1999; and May 1, 2011.
                      In that case, the corresponding first two DATE subtags
                      would require the months
                      to be distinctive (199906 and 199912), but the last
                      subtag would only require the year (2011).</t>
                             </list>
                     </t>
                     <t>
                             Some mechanisms may use a versioning system that is not
                             distinguished by date, or not by date alone.
                             In the latter case,
                             the version will be of a form specified by
                             <xref target="UTS35"></xref>
                             for that mechanism.
                             For example, if the mechanism xxx uses
                             versions of the form v21a,
                             then a tag could look like
                             "ja-t-it-m0-xxx-v21a". If there are
                             multiple sub-versions
                             distinguished by date,
                             then a tag could look like
                             "ja-t-it-m0-xxx-v21a-2007".
                     </t>
             </list>
             
                </t>
                <t>A language tag with the 't' extension MAY be used to request a specific transform of content.
                In such a case, the recipient SHOULD return content that corresponds
                as closely as feasible to the requested transform, including the specification of the mechanism.
                For example, if the request is ja-t-it-m0-xxx-v21a-2007,
                and the recipient has content corresponding to both ja-t-it-m0-xxx-v21a and ja-t-it-m0-xxx-v21b-2009, then the v21a version would be preferred.
                As is the case for language matching as discussed in <xref target="BCP47"></xref>,
                different implementations MAY have different measures of "closeness".</t>

             Beginning with CLDR version 1.7.2, machine-readable files are
             available listing the data defined for BCP 47 extensions for each
             successive version of <xref target="UTS35"></xref>.
             The data in these files is used for testing the validity of
             subtags for the 't' extension and for the
             'u' extension <xref target="RFC6067"/>,
             for which the Unicode Consortium is also the maintaining
             authority.
             These releases are listed on
             http://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads.
             Each release has an associated data directory of the form
             "http://unicode.org/Public/cldr/&lt;version&gt;", where
             "&lt;version&gt;" is replaced by the release number. For example,
             for version 1.7.2, the "core.zip" file is located at
             http://unicode.org/Public/cldr/1.7.2/core.zip.
             The most recent version is always identified by the version
             "latest" and can be accessed by the URL in
             <xref target="regform"></xref>.</t>

                  <t>
             Inside the "core.zip" file, the directory "common/bcp47"
             contains the
             data files listing the valid attributes, keys, and types for each
             successive version of <xref target="UTS35"></xref>.
             Each data file lists the keys and types relevant to that

                <t>
             To get the version information in XML when working with the data
             files, the XML parser must be validating. When the 'core.zip' file
             is unzipped, the 'dtd' directory will be at the same level as the
             'bcp47' directory; this is required for correct validation. For
             each release after CLDR 1.8, types introduced in that release are
             also marked in the data files by the XML attribute "since", such as
             in the following example:
             <figure>
                     <artwork>&lt;type name="adp" since="1.9"/&gt; </artwork>
             </figure>
            </t>
         <t>
          The data is also currently maintained in a source code repository,
          with each release tagged, for viewing directly without unzipping.
          For example, see:

                CLDR Technical

              IANA has inserted the record of
              <xref target="regform"></xref>
              into the Language Extensions Registry, according to
              Section 3.7 ("Extensions and the Extensions Registry")
              of "Tags for Identifying Languages" <xref target="BCP47"></xref>.
              Per Section 5.2 of
              <xref target="BCP47"></xref>, there might be occasional (rare)
requests by the Unicode
                Consortium (the "Authority" listed in the record) for
maintenance of
                this record. Changes that can be submitted to IANA without the
                publication of a new RFC are limited to modification of the
                Comments, Contact_Email, Mailing_List, and URL fields. Any such
                requested changes MUST use the domain 'unicode.org' in any new
                addresses or URIs, MUST explicitly cite this document (so that IANA
                can reference these requirements), and MUST originate from the
                'unicode.org' domain. The domain or authority can only be changed
                via a new RFC.

                The security considerations for this extension are the same as those
                for
                <xref target="BCP47"></xref>. See
                <xref target="BCP47">RFC 5646, Section 6, Security Considerations</xref>.
