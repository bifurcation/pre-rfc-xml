    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the manner in which generic application
      information (i.e., information not directly related to the operation of
      the Intermediate System to
   Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol) should be advertised in IS-IS Link State Protocol Data Units (LSPs) and defines
      guidelines that should be used when flooding such information.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>

    <section title="Overview">
      <t><xref target="ISO10589"></xref> defines the format of
      Type-Length-Values (TLVs) that may be sent in 
      IS-IS Protocol Data Units
      (PDUs). The first octet of a TLV encodes the "type" or "codepoint" that
      provides a scope for the information and information format that
      follows. The protocol is therefore limited to 256 different codepoints
      that may be assigned. This number has proved generous as regards the
      information required for correct operation of the IS-IS protocol. However, the increasing use of
      IS-IS Link State Protocol Data Units (LSPs) for advertisement of generic
      information (GENINFO) not directly related to the operation of the IS-IS
      protocol places additional demands on the TLV encoding space that have
      the potential to consume a significant number of TLV codepoints. This
      document therefore defines an encoding format for GENINFO that
      minimizes the consumption of TLV codepoints and also maximizes the
      flexibility of the formats that can be used to represent GENINFO.</t>

      <t>This document also discusses optimal behavior associated with the
      advertisement and flooding of LSPs containing GENINFO in order to avoid
      the advertisement of stale information and minimize the presence of
      duplicate or conflicting information when advertisements are
      updated.</t>

      <t>The manner in which the information contained in GENINFO TLVs is
      exchanged between an instance of the IS-IS protocol and the application
      that generates or consumes the GENINFO is outside the scope of this
      specification.</t>

      <t>In order to minimize the impact that advertisement of GENINFO may have on
      the operation of routing, such advertisements MUST occur in the context
      of a non-zero instance of the IS-IS protocol as defined in <xref
      target="RFC6822"></xref> except where the rules for the use of
      the zero instance set out later in this document are followed.</t>

    <section title="Encoding Format for GENINFO">
      <t>The encoding format defined below has the following goals regarding
      the advertisement of GENINFO in IS-IS LSPs:</t>

      <t>In order to support these goals, a new IANA registry has been created.
      This registry manages the assignment of IS-IS GENINFO Application
      Identifiers. These numbers are unsigned 16-bit numbers ranging in value
      from 1 to 65535. Application-specific sub-TLV codepoints are unsigned 8-bit numbers ranging in value from 0 to 255. The assignment of the
      sub-TLV codepoints is scoped by the Application Identifier. Management
      of the application specific sub-TLV codepoints is outside the scope of
      this document.</t>

      <section title="Use of Sub-TLVs in GENINFO TLV">
        <t></t>

        <t><xref target="RFC5305"></xref> introduced the definition and use of
        sub-TLVs. One of the advantages of using sub-TLVs rather than fixed
        encoding of information inside a TLV is to allow for the addition of
        new information in a backwards compatible manner, i.e., just as with
        TLVs, implementations are required to ignore sub-TLVs that they do
        not understand.</t>

        <t>GENINFO TLVs MAY include sub-TLVs in the application specific
        information as deemed necessary and appropriate for each application.
        The scope of the codepoints used in such sub-TLVs is defined by the
        combination of the GENINFO TLV codepoint and the Application ID, i.e.,
        the sub-TLV codepoints are private to the application. Such sub-TLVs
        are referred to as APPsub-TLVs.</t>

        <t>Additional levels of APPsub-TLVs may be required when there is
        variable information that is scoped by a specific APPsub-TLV. These
        "nested" sub-TLVs MUST be encoded in the same manner as sub-TLVs, i.e.,
        with a one-octet Type field, a one-octet Length field, and zero or
        more octets of Value.</t>

    <section title="GENINFO Flooding Procedures">
      <t>This section describes procedures that apply to the propagation of
      LSPs that contain GENINFO TLVs. These procedures have been previously
      discussed in <xref target="RFC4971"></xref>. This section is intended to
      serve as a reference specification for future documents that define the
      use of GENINFO TLV(s) for a specific application -- eliminating the need
      to repeat the definition of these procedures in the application-specific
      documents.</t>

      <t>Each GENINFO TLV contains information regarding exactly one
      application instance as identified by the Application ID in the GENINFO
      TLV. When it is necessary to advertise sets of information with the same
      Application ID that have different flooding scopes, a router MUST
      originate a minimum of one GENINFO TLV for each required flooding scope.
      GENINFO TLVs that contain information having area/level scope will have
      the S bit clear. These TLVs MUST NOT be leaked into another level.
      GENINFO TLVs that contain information that has domain scope will have
      the S bit set. These TLVs MUST be leaked into other IS-IS levels. When a
      TLV is leaked from Level-2 to Level-1, the D bit MUST be set in the
      Level-1 LSP advertisement.</t>

      <section title="Leaking Procedures">
        <t>When leaking GENINFO TLVs downward from Level-2 into Level-1, if
        the originator of the TLV is a Level-1 router in another area, it is
        possible that multiple copies of the same TLV may be received from
        multiple L2 routers in the originating area. A router performing
        downward leaking MUST check for such duplication by comparing the
        contents of the TLVs. The set of LSPs generated by a router for a
        given level MUST NOT contain two or more copies of the same GENINFO
        TLV.</t>

        <t>In order to prevent the use of stale GENINFO information, a system
        MUST NOT use a GENINFO TLV present in an LSP of a system that is not
        currently reachable via Level-x paths, where "x" is the level (1 or 2)
        associated with the LSP in which the GENINFO TLV appears. Note that
        leaking a GENINFO TLV is one of the uses that is prohibited under
        these conditions. The following example illustrates what might occur
        in the absence of this restriction.</t>

        <t>Example: If Level-1 router A generates a GENINFO TLV and floods it
        to two L1/L2 routers S and T, they will flood it into the Level-2
        sub-domain. Now suppose the Level-1 area partitions, such that A and S
        are in one partition and T is in another. IP routing will still
        continue to work, but if A now issues a revised version of the GENINFO
        TLV, or decides to stop advertising it, S will follow suit, but T will
        continue to advertise the old version until the LSP times out.</t>

        <t>Routers in other areas have to choose whether to trust T's copy of
        A's GENINFO TLV or S's copy of A's information and they have no
        reliable way to choose. By making sure that T stops leaking A's
        information, this removes the possibility that other routers will use
        stale information from A.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Minimizing Update Confusion">
        <t></t>

        <t>If an update to a TLV is advertised in an LSP with a different
        number than the LSP associated with the old advertisement, the
        possibility exists that other systems can temporarily have either 0
        copies of a particular advertisement or 2 copies of a particular
        advertisement, depending on the order in which new copies of the LSP
        that had the old advertisement and the LSP that has the new
        advertisement arrive at other systems.</t>

        <t>Whenever possible, an implementation SHOULD advertise the update to
        a GENINFO TLV in the LSP with the same number as the advertisement
        that it replaces. Where this is not possible, the two affected LSPs
        SHOULD be flooded as an atomic action.</t>

        <t>Systems that receive an update to an existing GENINFO TLV can
        minimize the potential disruption associated with the update by
        employing a hold-down time prior to processing the update so as to
        allow for the receipt of multiple LSPs associated with the same update
        prior to beginning processing.</t>

        <t></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Interpreting Attribute Information">
        <t>Where a receiving system has two copies of a GENINFO TLV with the
        same Application ID, attribute information in the two TLVs that does
        not conflict MUST be considered additive. When information in the two
        GENINFO TLVs conflicts, i.e., there are different settings for a given
        attribute, the procedure used to choose which copy shall be used is
        undefined.</t>

    <section title="Use of a Separate Protocol Instance">
      <t>The use of the IS-IS flooding mechanism as a means of reliably and
      efficiently propagating information is understandably attractive.
      However, it is prudent to remember that the primary purpose of that
      mechanism is to flood information necessary for the correct operation of
      the IS-IS protocol. Flooding of information not directly related to the
      use of the IS-IS protocol in support of routing degrades the operation
      of the protocol. Degradation occurs because the frequency of LSP updates
      is increased and because the processing of non-routing information in
      each router consumes resources whose primary responsibility is to
      efficiently respond to reachability changes in the network.</t>

      <t>Advertisement of GENINFO therefore MUST occur in the context of a
      non-zero instance of the IS-IS protocol as defined in <xref
      target="RFC6822"></xref> except when the use in the zero
      instance is defined in a Standards Track RFC.</t>

      <t>The use of a separate instance of the protocol allows both the
      flooding and the processing of the non-routing information to be
      decoupled from the information necessary to support correct routing of
      data in the network. The flooding and processing of non-routing
      information can then be prioritized appropriately.</t>

      <t>Use of a separate protocol instance to advertise GENINFO does not
      eliminate the need to use prudence in the frequency with which such
      information is updated. One of the most egregious oversights is a
      failure to appropriately dampen changes in the information to be
      advertised; this can lead to flooding storms. Documents that specify
      the use of the mechanisms defined here MUST define the expected rate of
      change of the information to be advertised.</t>

      <t>If desirable, independent control of the flooding scope for
      information related to two different applications can be achieved by
      utilizing separate non-zero protocol instances for each
      application <xref target="RFC6822"></xref>.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Applicability of GENINFO TLV">
      <t>The GENINFO TLV supports the advertisement of application-specific
      information in IS-IS LSPs that is not directly related to the operation
      of the IS-IS protocol. Information advertised in the GENINFO TLV MUST
      NOT alter basic IS-IS protocol operation including (but not limited to)
      the establishment of adjacencies, the update process, and the decision
      process.</t>

      <t>IANA has also created a new registry. The new registry
      manages the assignment of Application Identifiers that may be used in
      the Generic Information TLV. These identifiers are unsigned 16-bit
      numbers ranging in value from 1 to 65535. The value 0 is reserved.
      The registration procedure is "Expert Review" as defined in <xref
      target="RFC5226"></xref>. The expert MUST verify that the public
      specification that defines the use of GENINFO for the application
      adequately discusses all points mentioned in Section 7 of this
      document.</t>

      <t>The following information MUST be specified in the registry:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>ID Value (1-65535)</t>

          <t>Description</t>

          <t>Allowed in Instance zero (Y/N)</t>

          <t>Reference Specification</t>
        </list></t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
