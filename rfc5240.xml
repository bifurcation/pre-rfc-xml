        For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current

        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
        the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
        accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
        Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
        Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
        module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
        RFC 2578 <xref target="RFC2578"/>, STD 58, RFC 2579
		<xref target="RFC2579"/> and STD 58, RFC 2580

        This MIB module contains four tables.  The tables are:
      </t>
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>
          The Candidate-RP Table, which contains one row for each multicast
          group address prefix for which the local router is configured to
          advertise itself as a Candidate-RP (C-RP).  This table exists on routers
          that are configured as Candidate-RP.

<!--[rfced] Terminology: Please note the following inconsistencies that occur 
  in the document. 

   Elected BSR / elected BSR / E-BSR 
      (perhaps capitalized is used for a specific instance of an elected BSR?)

   Candidate-BSR  / Candidate BSR  
      (consistently hyphenated in "Candidate-BSR Table")

   Candidate-RP / Candidate RP  
      (consistently hyphenated in "Candidate-RP Table")

Should these be made uniform? 

Bharat: I have fixed this, so you can remove this comment.

        <t>
          The Elected BSR RP-Set Table, which contains one row for each
          Group-to-RP mapping that was received in C-RP advertisements.
		  This table exists on a router that is an elected BSR (E-BSR).

          The Candidate-BSR Table, which contains one row for each

      There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
      with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
      objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
      environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
      environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
      network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability:

      <list style="symbols">
	  <t>
	  	A new Candidate-BSR with high priority or modification of priority
		( bsrCandidateBSRPriority ) of an existing Candidate-BSR can
		take over the functionality of an Elected BSR, which can prevent and
		disrupt the services.
	  </t>
	  <t>
		A new Candidate-RP with lower priority or modification of priority
		( bsrCandidateRPPriority ) of an existing Candidate-RP can force
		other routers to select itself for a particular group prefix. This
		can prevent and disrupt the services provided through this group prefix.

       Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
       MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
       vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
       control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
       to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
       the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
       sensitivity/vulnerability:

        SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
        Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
        there is still no control over whom on the secure network is allowed
        to access (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module.
      </t>
      <t>
        It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
        provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see
        <xref target="RFC3410"/>, section 8),
        including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
        authentication and privacy).
      </t>
      <t>
        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
        RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
        instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
        the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
        rights to access (read/change/create/delete) them.
