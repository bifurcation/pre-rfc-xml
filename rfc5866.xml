      <t>This document describes the framework, messages, and procedures for the Diameter <xref
          target="RFC3588"> </xref> Quality-of-Service (QoS) application. The Diameter QoS
        application allows Network Elements (NEs) to interact with Diameter servers when allocating
        QoS resources in the network.</t>

      <t>Two modes of operation are defined. In the first, called "Pull" mode, the network element
        requests QoS authorization from the Diameter server based on some trigger (such as a QoS
        signaling protocol) that arrives along the data path. In the second, called "Push" mode, the
        Diameter server proactively sends a command to the network element(s) to install QoS
        authorization state. This could be triggered, for instance, by off-path signaling, such as
        Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261"/> call control.</t>

      <t>A set of command codes is specified that allows a single Diameter QoS application server to
        support both Pull and Push modes based on the requirements of network technologies,
        deployment scenarios, and end-host capabilities. In conjunction with Diameter Attribute Value Pairs (AVPs) defined in
          <xref target="RFC5777"/> and in <xref target="RFC5624"/>, this
        document depicts basic call-flow procedures used to establish, modify, and terminate a
        Diameter QoS application session.</t>

      <t>This document defines a number of Diameter-encoded AVPs, which are
        described using a modified version of the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF), see <xref
          target="RFC3588"/>.</t>

        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="AAA Cloud"><vspace blankLines="0"/> An infrastructure of Authentication,
            Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) entities (clients, agents, servers) communicating via
            a AAA protocol over trusted, secure connections. It offers authentication, authorization,
            and accounting services to applications in local and roaming scenarios. Diameter and
            RADIUS <xref target="RFC2865"/> are both widely deployed AAA protocols. <vspace

          <t hangText="Application Endpoint (AppE)"><vspace blankLines="0"/> An Application Endpoint
            is an entity in an end-user device that exchanges signaling messages with Application
            Servers or directly with other Application Endpoints. Based on the result of this
            signaling, the endpoint may make a request for QoS from the network. For example, a SIP
            User Agent is one kind of Application Endpoint. <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

          <t hangText="Application Server (AppS)"><vspace blankLines="0"/> An Application Server is
            an entity that exchanges signaling messages with an Application Endpoint (see above). It
            may be a source of authorization for QoS-enhanced application flows. For example, a SIP
            server is one kind of Application Server.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

          <t hangText="Authorizing Entity (AE)"><vspace blankLines="0"/> The Authorizing Entity is a
            Diameter server that supports the QoS application. It is responsible for authorizing QoS
            requests for a particular application flow or aggregate. The Authorizing Entity may be a
            standalone entity or may be integrated with an Application Server and may be co&nbhy;located
            with a subscriber database. This entity corresponds to the Policy Decision Point (PDP)
              <xref target="RFC2753"/>.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

          <t hangText="Network Element (NE)"><vspace blankLines="0"/> A QoS-aware router that acts
            as a Diameter client for the QoS application. This entity triggers the protocol
            interaction for Pull mode, and it is the recipient of QoS information in Push
            mode. The Diameter client at a Network Element corresponds to the Policy Enforcement
            Point (PEP) <xref target="RFC2753"/>.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

          <t hangText="Pull Mode"><vspace blankLines="0"/>In this mode, the QoS authorization
            process is invoked by the QoS reservation request received from the Application
            Endpoint. The Network Element then requests the QoS authorization decision from the
            Authorizing Entity.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

          <t hangText="Push Mode"><vspace blankLines="0"/>In this mode, the QoS authorization
            process is invoked by the request from the Application Server or local policies in the
            Authorizing Entity. The Authorizing Entity then installs the QoS authorization decision
            to the Network Element directly. <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

          <t hangText="Resource Requesting Entity (RRE)"><vspace blankLines="0"/> A Resource
            Requesting Entity is a logical entity that supports the protocol interaction for QoS
            resources. The RRE resides in the end-host and is able to communicate with peer logical
            entities in an Authorizing Entity or a Network Element to trigger the QoS authorization
              process.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

      <t><xref target="fig-qos-aaa"/> depicts NEs through which media flows need to pass, a cloud of
        AAA servers, and an AE. Note that there may be more than one router that needs to interact
        with the AAA cloud along the path of a given application flow, although the figure only
        depicts one for clarity.</t>

      <t>In some deployment scenarios, NEs may request authorization through the AAA cloud based on
        an incoming QoS reservation request. The NE will route the request to a designated AE. The
        AE will return the result of the authorization decision. In other deployment scenarios, the
        authorization will be initiated upon dynamic application state, so that the request must be
        authenticated and authorized based on information from one or more AppSs. After receiving
        the authorization request from the AppS or the NE, the AE decides the appropriate mode
        (i.e., Push or Pull). The usage of Push or Pull mode can be determined by the Authorizing
        Entity either statically or dynamically. Static determination might be based on a
        configurable defined policy in the Authorizing Entity, while dynamic determination might be
        based on information received from an application server. For Push mode, the Authorizing
        Entity needs to identify the appropriate NE(s) to which QoS authorization information needs
        to be pushed. It might determine this based on information received from the AppS, such as
        the IP addresses of media flows.</t>

      <t>In some deployment scenarios, there is a mapping between access network type and the
        service logic (e.g., selection of Push or Pull mode and other differentiated handling
        of the resource admission and control). The access network type might be derived from the
        authorization request from the AppS or the NE, and in this case, the Authorizing Entity can
        identify the corresponding service logic based on the mapping.</t>

      <t>If the interface between the NEs and the AAA cloud is identical regardless of whether or not the
        AE communicates with an AppS, routers are insulated from the details of particular
        applications and need not know that Application Servers are involved. Also, the AAA cloud
        may also encompass business relationships such as those between network operators and
        third-party application providers. This enables flexible intra- or inter-domain
        authorization, accounting, and settlement.</t>

        <t>The processing of incoming QoS reservation requests includes three actions: admission
          control, authorization, and resource reservation.</t>

        <t>The admission control function provides information about available resources and
          determines whether there are enough resources to fulfill the request. Authorization is
          performed by the Diameter client, which involves contacting an authorization entity
          through the AAA cloud shown in <xref target="architecture"/>. If both checks are
          successful, the authorized QoS parameters are set in the packet classifier and the packet
          scheduler. Note that the parameters passed to the Traffic Control function may be
          different from the ones that requested QoS (depending on the authorization decision). Once the
          requested resource is granted, the Resource Management function provides accounting
          information to the AE via the Diameter client.</t>

          <t>The QoS capabilities of Application Endpoints are varied, and can be categorized as

              <t hangText="Category 1"><vspace blankLines="0"/> A Category 1 Application Endpoint
                has no QoS capability at either the application or the network level. This type of

              <t hangText="Category 2"><vspace blankLines="0"/> A Category 2 Application Endpoint
                only has QoS capability at the application level. This type of AppE is able to set
                up a connection through application signaling with certain resource/QoS requirements
                (e.g., application attributes), but it is unable to signal any resource/QoS
                requirements at the network level. <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

              <t hangText="Category 3"><vspace blankLines="0"/> A Category 3 Application Endpoint
                has QoS capability at the network level. This type of AppE may set up a connection
                through application signaling, translate service characteristics into network
                resource/QoS requirements (e.g., network QoS class) locally, and request the
                resources through network signaling, e.g., Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP)
                  <xref target="RFC2205"/> or Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) <xref target="NSIS-QOS"/>.</t>
            </list></t>
        </section>

        <section title="Interaction Modes between the Authorizing Entity and Network Element">
          <t>Different QoS mechanisms are employed in packet networks. Those QoS mechanisms can be
            categorized into two schemes: IntServ <xref target="RFC2211"/> <xref target="RFC2212"/>
            and Diffserv <xref target="RFC2474"/>. In the IntServ scheme, network signaling (e.g.,
            RSVP, NSIS, or link-specific signaling) is commonly used to initiate a request from an
            AppE for the desired QoS resource. In the Diffserv scheme, QoS resources are provisioned
            based upon some predefined QoS service classes rather than AppE-initiated, flow-based
            QoS requests.</t>

          <t>It is obvious that the eligible QoS scheme is correlated to the AppE's capability in
            the context of QoS authorization. Since Category 1 and 2 AppEs cannot initiate the QoS
            resource requests by means of network signaling, using the current
mechanism of the IntServ
            model to signal QoS information across the network is not applicable to them in general.
            Depending on network technology and operator requirements, a Category 3 AppE may either
            make use of network signaling for resource requests or not.</t>

          <t>The diversity of QoS capabilities of endpoints and QoS schemes of network technology
            leads to the distinction on the interaction mode between the QoS authorization system and
            underlying NEs. When the IntServ scheme is employed by a Category 3 endpoint, the
            authorization process is typically initiated by an NE when a trigger is received from the
            endpoint such as network QoS signaling. In the Diffserv scheme, since the NE is unable
            to request the resource authorization on its own initiative, the authorization process
            is typically triggered by either the request of AppSs or policies defined by the
            operator.</t>

          <t>As a consequence, two interaction modes are needed in support of different combinations
            of QoS schemes and endpoint&rsquo;s QoS capabilities: Push mode and Pull mode.</t>

          <t>
            <list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="Push mode"><vspace blankLines="0"/> The QoS authorization process is
                triggered by AppSs or local network conditions (e.g., time of day on resource usage
                and QoS classes), and the authorization decisions are installed by the AE to the
                network element on its own initiative without explicit request. In order to support
                Push mode, the AE (i.e., Diameter server) should be able to initiate a Diameter
                authorization session to communicate with the NE (i.e., Diameter client) without any
                preestablished connection from the network element. <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

              <t hangText="Pull mode"><vspace blankLines="0"/> The QoS authorization process is
                triggered by the network signaling received from end-user equipment or by a local
                event in the NE according to pre-configured policies, and authorization decisions
                are produced upon the request of the NE. In order to support Pull mode, the NE
                (i.e., Diameter client) will initiate a Diameter authorization session to
                communicate with the Authorizing Entity (i.e., Diameter server).</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>For Category 1 and 2 Application Endpoints, Push mode is REQUIRED. For a Category 3
            AppE, either Push mode or Pull mode MAY be used.</t>

          <t>Push mode is applicable to certain networks, for example, Cable network, DSL, Ethernet,
            and Diffserv-enabled IP/MPLS. Pull mode is more appropriate to IntServ-enabled IP
            networks or certain wireless networks such as the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) networks defined by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). Some
            networks (for example, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)) may require both Push and Pull modes.</t>

        <section anchor="authz_models" title="Pull Mode Schemes">
          <t>Three types of basic authorization schemes for Pull mode exist: one type of two-party
            scheme and two types of three-party schemes. The notation adopted here is in respect to
            the entity that performs the QoS authorization (QoS Authz). The authentication of the
            QoS requesting entity might be done at the NE as part of the QoS signaling protocol, or
            by an off-path protocol (on the application layer or for network access authentication)
            or the AE might be contacted with a request for authentication and authorization of the
            QoS requesting entity. From the Diameter QoS application's point of view, these schemes
            differ in type of information that need to be carried. Here we focus on the "Basic Three-Party Scheme" (see <xref target="fig-three-party-approach"/>) and the "Token-Based Three-Party Scheme" (see <xref target="fig-three-party-token-approach"/>). In the "Two-Party
            Scheme", the QoS RRE is authenticated by the NE and the authorization decision is made
            either locally at the NE itself or offloaded to a trusted entity (most likely within the
            same administrative domain). In the two-party case, no Diameter QoS protocol interaction
            is required.</t>

          <t>In the "Basic Three-Party Scheme", a QoS reservation request that arrives at the NE is
            forwarded to the Authorizing Entity (e.g., in the user's home network), where the
            authorization decision is made. As shown, financial settlement -- a business
            relationship, such as a roaming agreement -- between the visited network and the home
            network ensures that the visited network is compensated for the resources consumed by
            the user via the home network.

          <t>The "Token-Based Three-Party Scheme" is applicable to environments where a previous
            protocol interaction is used to request authorization tokens to assist the authorization
            process at the NE or the AE <xref target="RFC3521"/>.</t>

          <t>The QoS RRE may be involved in an application-layer protocol interaction, for example,
            using SIP <xref target="RFC3313"/>, with the AE. As part of this interaction,
            authentication and authorization at the application layer might take place. As a result
            of a successful authorization decision, which might involve the user's home AAA server,
            an authorization token is generated by the AE (e.g., the SIP proxy and an entity trusted
            by the SIP proxy) and returned to the end-host for inclusion into the QoS signaling
            protocol. The authorization token will be used by an NE that receives the QoS signaling
            message to authorize the QoS request. Alternatively, the Diameter QoS application will
            be used to forward the authorization token to the user's home network. The authorization
            token allows for the authorization decision performed at the application layer to be
            associated with a corresponding QoS signaling session. Note that the authorization token
            might either refer to established state concerning the authorization decision or the
            token might itself carry the authorized parameters (protected by a digital signature or
            a keyed message digest to prevent tampering). In the latter case, the authorization token
            may contain several pieces of information pertaining to the authorized application
            session, but at minimum it should contain: <list style="symbols">
              <t>An identifier for the AE (for example, an AppS) that issued the authorization token;</t>

              <t>An identifier referring to a specific application protocol session for which the
                token was issued; and</t>

              <t>A keyed message digest or digital signature protecting the content of the
                authorization token.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>A possible structure for the authorization token and the policy element carrying it are
            proposed in the context of RSVP <xref target="RFC3520"/>.</t>

          <t>In the scenario mentioned above, where the QoS resource requesting entity is involved
            in an application-layer protocol interaction with the AE, it may be worthwhile to
            consider a token-less binding mechanism also. The application-layer protocol interaction
            may have indicated the transport port numbers at the QoS RRE where it might receive
            media streams (for example, in SIP/SDP <xref target="RFC4566"/> signaling, these port
            numbers are advertised). The QoS RRE may also use these port numbers in some IP filter
            indications to the NE performing QoS reservation so that it may properly tunnel the
            inbound packets. The NE performing QoS reservation will forward the QoS resource
            requesting entity's IP address and the IP filter indications to the AE in the QoS
            authorization request. The AE will use the QoS RRE's IP address and the port numbers in
            the IP filter indication, which will match the port numbers advertised in the earlier
            application-layer protocol interaction, to identify the right piece of policy
            information to be sent to the NE performing the QoS reservation in the QoS
            Authorization response.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Push Mode Schemes">
          <t>Push mode can be further divided into two types: endpoint-initiated and
            network-initiated. In the former case, the authorization process is triggered by AppS in
            response to an explicit QoS request from an endpoint through application signaling,
            e.g., SIP; in the latter case, the authorization process is triggered by the AppS
            without an explicit QoS request from an endpoint.</t>

          <t>In the endpoint-initiated scheme, the QoS RRE (i.e., the AppE) determines the required
            application-level QoS and sends a QoS request through an application signaling message.
            The AppS will extract application-level QoS information and trigger the authorization
            process to the AE. In the network-initiated scheme, the AE and/or AppS should derive and
            determine the QoS requirements according to application attribute, subscription, and
            endpoint capability when the endpoint does not explicitly indicate the QoS attributes.
            The AE makes an authorization decision based on application-level QoS information,
            network policies, end-user subscription, network resource availability, etc., and
            installs the decision to the NE directly.</t>

          <t>A Category 1 AppE requires network-initiated Push mode and a Category 2 AppE may use
            either type of Push Mode.</t>

      <section title="QoS Application Requirements">
        <t>A QoS application must meet a number of requirements applicable to a diverse set of
          networking environments and services. It should be compatible with different deployment
          scenarios having specific QoS signaling models and security issues. Satisfying the
          requirements listed below while interworking with QoS signaling protocols, a Diameter QoS
          application should accommodate the capabilities of the QoS signaling protocols rather than
          introduce functional requirements on them. A list of requirements for a QoS
          authorization application is provided here:</t>

        <t>
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Identity-based Routing"><vspace blankLines="0"/> The Diameter QoS
              application MUST route AAA requests to the Authorizing Entity, based on the provided
              identity of the QoS requesting entity or the identity of the AE encoded in the
              provided authorization token.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

            <t hangText="Flexible Authentication Support"><vspace blankLines="0"/> The Diameter QoS
              application MUST support a variety of different authentication protocols for
              verification of authentication information present in QoS signaling messages. The
              support for these protocols MAY be provided indirectly by tying the signaling
              communication for QoS to a previous authentication protocol exchange (e.g., using
              network access authentication).<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

            <t hangText="Making an Authorization Decision"><vspace blankLines="0"/> The Diameter QoS
              application MUST exchange sufficient information between the AE and the enforcing
              entity (and vice versa) to compute an authorization decision and to execute this
                decision.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

            <t hangText="Triggering an Authorization Process"><vspace blankLines="0"/> The Diameter
              QoS application MUST allow periodic and event-triggered execution of the authorization
              process, originated at the enforcing entity or even at the AE.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

            <t hangText="Associating QoS Reservations and Application State"><vspace blankLines="0"
              /> The Diameter QoS application MUST carry information sufficient for an AppS to
              identify the appropriate application session and associate it with a particular QoS
                reservation.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

            <t hangText="Dynamic Authorization"><vspace blankLines="0"/> It MUST be possible for the
              Diameter QoS application to push updates towards the NE(s) from Authorizing
                Entities.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

            <t hangText="Bearer Gating"><vspace blankLines="0"/> The Diameter QoS application MUST
              allow the AE to gate (i.e., enable/disable) authorized application flows based on,
              e.g., application state transitions.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

            <t hangText="Accounting Records"><vspace blankLines="0"/> The Diameter QoS application
              MAY define QoS accounting records containing duration, volume (byte count) usage
              information, and a description of the QoS attributes (e.g., bandwidth, delay, loss rate)
              that were supported for the flow.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

            <t hangText="Sending Accounting Records"><vspace blankLines="0"/> The NE SHOULD be able
              to send accounting records for a particular QoS reservation state to an accounting
                entity.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

            <t hangText="Failure Notification"><vspace blankLines="0"/> The Diameter QoS application
              MUST allow the NE to report failures, such as loss of connectivity due to movement of
              a mobile node or other reasons for packet loss, to the Authorizing Entity.<vspace
                blankLines="1"/></t>

            <t hangText="Accounting Correlation"><vspace blankLines="0"/> The Diameter QoS
              application MAY support the exchange of sufficient information to allow for
              correlation between accounting records generated by the NEs and accounting records
              generated by an AppS.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

            <t hangText="Interaction with Other AAA Applications"><vspace blankLines="0"/>
              Interaction with other AAA applications, such as the Diameter Network Access Server
              Application <xref target="RFC4005"/>, may be required for exchange of authorization,
              authentication, and accounting information.<vspace blankLines="1"/>
</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>In deployment scenarios where authentication of the QoS reservation requesting entity
          (e.g., the user) is done by means outside the Diameter QoS application protocol
          interaction, the AE is contacted only with a request for QoS authorization. Authentication
          might have taken place already via the interaction with the Diameter application <xref target="RFC4005" /> or
          as part of the QoS signaling protocol (e.g., Transport Layer Security (TLS) <xref
            target="RFC5246"/> in the General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) protocol <xref
            target="NSIS-NTLP"/>).</t>

        <t>Authentication of the QoS reservation requesting entity to the AE is necessary if a
          particular Diameter QoS application protocol cannot be related (or if there is no
          intention to relate it) to a prior authentication. In this case, the AE MUST authenticate
          the QoS reservation requesting entity in order to authorize the QoS request as part of the
          Diameter QoS protocol interaction.</t>

        <t>This document refers to three types of sessions that need to be properly correlated.</t>

        <t>
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="QoS Signaling Session"><vspace blankLines="0"/> The time period during
              which a QoS signaling protocol establishes, maintains, and deletes a QoS reservation
              state at the QoS network element is referred to as a QoS signaling session. Different
              QoS signaling protocols use different ways to identify QoS signaling sessions. The
              same applies to different usage environments. Currently, this document supports three
              types of QoS session identifiers, namely a signaling session id (e.g., the Session
              Identifier used by the NSIS protocol suite), a flow id (e.g., identifier assigned by
              an application to a certain flow as used in the 3GPP), and a flow description based on
              the IP parameters of the flow's endpoints.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

            <t hangText="Diameter Authorization Session"><vspace blankLines="0"/> The time period
              for which a Diameter server authorizes a requested service (i.e., QoS resource
              reservation) is referred to as a Diameter authorization session. It is identified by a
              Session-Id included in all Diameter messages used for management of the authorized
              service (initial authorization, re-authorization, termination), see <xref
                target="RFC3588"/>.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

            <t hangText="Application-Layer Session"><vspace blankLines="0"/> The application-layer
              session identifies the duration of an application-layer service that requires
              provision of a certain QoS. An application-layer session identifier is provided by the
              QoS requesting entity in the QoS signaling messages, for example as part of the
              authorization token. In general, the application session identifier is opaque to the
              QoS-aware NEs. It is included in the authorization request message sent to the AE and
              helps it to correlate the QoS authorization request to the application session state
              information. <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>Correlating these sessions is done at each of the three involved entities: The QoS
          requesting entity correlates the application with the QoS signaling sessions. The QoS NE
          correlates the QoS signaling session with the Diameter authorization sessions. The AE
          SHOULD bind the information about the three sessions together. Note that in certain
          scenarios, not all of the sessions are present. For example, the application session might
          not be visible to the QoS signaling protocol directly if there is no binding between the
          application session and the QoS requesting entity using the QoS signaling protocol.</t>

    <!-- ====================================================================== -->

    <section title="QoS Application Session Establishment and Management">
      <section title="Parties Involved">
        <t>Authorization models supported by this application include three parties: <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>Resource Requesting Entity</t>

            <t>Network Elements (Diameter QoS application (DQA) client)</t>

            <t>Authorizing Entity (Diameter QoS application (DQA) server)</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Note that the QoS RRE is only indirectly involved in the message exchange. This entity
          provides the trigger to initiate the Diameter QoS protocol interaction by transmitting QoS
          signaling messages. The Diameter QoS application is only executed between the Network
          Element (i.e., DQA client) and the Authorizing Entity (i.e., DQA server).</t>

        <t>The QoS RRE may communicate with the AE using application-layer signaling for the negotiation
          of service parameters. As part of this application-layer protocol interaction, for example
          using SIP, authentication and authorization might take place. This message exchange is,
          however, outside the scope of this document. The protocol communication between the QoS
          resource requesting entity and the QoS NE might be accomplished using the NSIS protocol
          suite, RSVP, or a link-layer signaling protocol. A description of these protocols is also
          outside the scope of this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Session Establishment">
        <t>Pull and Push modes use a different set of command codes for session establishment.
          For other operations, such as session modification and termination, they use the same set
          of command codes.</t>

        <t>The selection of Pull mode or Push mode operation is based on the trigger of the QoS
          authorization session. When a QoS-Authorization-Request (QAR, see <xref target="QAR"/>)
          message with a new Session-Id is received, the AE operates in Pull mode; when other
          triggers are received, the AE operates in Push mode. Similarly, when a
          QoS-Install-Request (QIR, see <xref target="QIR"/>} with a new Session-Id is received, the
          NE operates in Push mode; when other triggers are received, the NE operates in Pull mode.</t>

        <t>The QoS authorization session is typically established per subscriber base (i.e., all
          requests with the same User-ID), but it is also possible to be
established on a per node or
          per request base. The concurrent sessions between an NE and an AE are identified by
          different Session-Ids.</t>

        <section title="Session Establishment for Pull Mode">
          <t>A request for a QoS reservation or local events received by an NE can trigger the
            initiation of a Diameter QoS authorization session. The NE converts the required objects
            from the QoS signaling message to Diameter AVPs and generates a QAR message.</t>

          <t><xref target="fig-initial-qos-request-pull"/> shows the protocol interaction between a
            Resource Requesting Entity, a Network Element, and the Authorizing Entity.</t>

          <t>The AE's identity, information about the application session and/or identity and
            credentials of the QoS RRE, requested QoS parameters, and the signaling session identifier
            and/or QoS-enabled data flows identifiers MAY be encapsulated into respective Diameter
            AVPs and included in the Diameter message sent to the AE. The QAR is sent to a Diameter
            server that can be either the home server of the QoS requesting entity or an AppS.</t>

            Based on the information in the QoS-Authentication-Data, User-Name, and QoS-Resources

            (enabled/disabled) from locally available information (e.g., policy information that may
            be previously established as part of an application-layer signaling exchange or the
            user's subscription profile). The QoS-Resources AVP is defined in <xref
              target="RFC5777"/>. The authorization decision is then reflected
            in the response returned to the Diameter client with the QoS-Authorization-Answer

          <t>The Authorizing Entity keeps authorization session state and SHOULD save additional
            information for management of the session (e.g., Signaling-Session-Id, authentication
            data) as part of the session state information.</t>

          <t>The final result of the authorization request is provided in the Result-Code AVP of the
            QAA message sent by the Authorizing Entity. In the case of successful authorization (i.e.,
            Result-Code = DIAMETER_LIMITED_SUCCESS (see <xref target="diameter-base-avps"/>)),
            information about the authorized QoS resources and the status of the authorized flow
            (enabled/disabled) is provided in the QoS-Resources AVP of the QAA message. The QoS
            information provided via the QAA is installed by the QoS Traffic Control function of the
            NE. The value DIAMETER_LIMITED_SUCCESS indicates that the AE expects confirmation via
            another QAR message for successful QoS resource reservation and for final reserved QoS
            resources (see below).</t>

          <t>One important piece of information returned from the Authorizing Entity is the
            authorization lifetime (carried inside the QAA). The authorization lifetime allows the
            NE to determine how long the authorization decision is valid for this particular QoS
            reservation. A number of factors may influence the authorized session duration, such as
            the user's subscription plan or the currently available credits at the user's account (see
              <xref target="accounting"/>). The authorization duration is time-based, as specified
            in <xref target="RFC3588"/>. For an extension of the authorization period, a new
            QoS-Authorization-Request/Answer message exchange SHOULD be initiated. Further aspects
            of QoS authorization session maintenance are discussed in Sections <xref target="re-authz" format="counter"/>,
              <xref target="session-termination" format="counter"/>, and <xref target="accounting" format="counter"/>.</t>

          <t>The indication of a successful QoS reservation and activation of the data flow is
            provided by the transmission of a QAR message, which reports the parameters of the
            established QoS state: reserved resources, duration of the reservation, and
            identification of the QoS enabled flow/QoS signaling session. The Diameter QoS server
            acknowledges the reserved QoS resources with the QA Answer (QAA) message where the
            Result-Code is set to 'DIAMETER_SUCCESS'. Note that the reserved QoS resources reported
            in this QAR message MAY be different than those authorized with the initial QAA message,
            due to the QoS-signaling-specific behavior (e.g., receiver-initiated reservations with
            One-Path-With-Advertisements) or specific process of QoS negotiation along the data
            path.</t>

            respective Diameter AVPs and included in the Diameter message sent from a Diameter QoS
            server in the Authorizing Entity to a Diameter QoS client in the NE. This requires that

          <t>Authorization processing starts at the Diameter QoS server when it receives a request
            from an RRE through an AppS (e.g., SIP Invite) or is triggered by a local event (e.g.,
            a pre-configured timer). Based on the received information, the server determines the
            authorized QoS resources and flow state (enabled/disabled) from locally available
            information (e.g., policy information that may be previously established as part of an
            application-layer signaling exchange, or the user's subscription profile). The
            authorization decision is then reflected in the QoS-Install-Request (QIR) message to the
            Diameter QoS client.</t>

          <t>The AE keeps authorization session state and SHOULD save additional information for
            management of the session (e.g., Signaling-Session-Id, authentication data) as part of
            the session state information.</t>

          <t>The final result of the authorization decision is provided in the QoS-Resources AVP of
            the QIR message sent by the AE. The QoS information provided via the QIR is installed by
            the QoS Traffic Control function of the NE.</t>

          <t>One important piece of information from the AE is the authorization lifetime (carried
            inside the QIR). The authorization lifetime allows the NE to determine how long the
            authorization decision is valid for this particular QoS reservation. A number of factors
            may influence the authorized session duration, such as the user's subscription plan or
            the currently available credits at the user's account (see <xref target="accounting"/>). The
            authorization duration is time-based as specified in <xref target="RFC3588"/>. For an
            extension of the authorization period, a new QoS-Install-Request/Answer message or
            QoS-Authorization-Request/Answer message exchange SHOULD be initiated. Further aspects
            of QoS authorization session maintenance are discussed in Sections <xref target="re-authz" format="counter"/>,
              <xref target="session-termination" format="counter"/>, and <xref target="accounting" format="counter"/>.</t>

          <t>The indication of QoS reservation and activation of the data flow can be provided by
            the QoS-Install-Answer message immediately. In the case of successful enforcement, the
            Result-Code (= DIAMETER_SUCCESS, (see <xref target="diameter-base-avps"/>)) information
            is provided in the QIA message. Note that the reserved QoS resources reported in the QIA
            message may be different than those initially authorized with the QIR message, due to
            the QoS signaling-specific behavior (e.g., receiver-initiated reservations with
            One-Path-With-Advertisements) or specific process of QoS negotiation along the data
            path. In the case that Multiple AEs control the same NE, the NE should make the selection on
            the authorization decision to be enforced based on the priority of the request.</t>

          <t>The Diameter QoS application node may obtain information of its peer nodes (e.g., Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN),
            IP address) through static configuration or dynamic discovery as described in Section
            5.2 of <xref target="RFC3588"/>. In particular, the NE shall perform the relevant

            by the RRE. For instance, it can be the Authorization Entity's ID stored in the

            globally routable IP address.</t>

        <t>Client- and server-side initiated re-authorizations are considered in the design of the
          Diameter QoS application. Whether the re&nbhy;authorization events are transparent for the
          resource requesting entity or result in specific actions in the QoS signaling protocol is
          outside the scope of the Diameter QoS application. It is directly dependent on the
          capabilities of the QoS signaling protocol.</t>

        <t>There are a number of options for policy rules according to which the NE (AAA client)
          contacts the AE for re-authorization. These rules depend on the semantics and contents of
          the QAA message sent by the AE:</t>

        <t>
          <list style="letters">
            <t>The QAA message contains the authorized parameters of the flow and its QoS and sets
              their limits (presumably upper). With these parameters, the AE specifies the services
              that the NE can provide and for which it will be financially compensated. Therefore, any change
              or request for change of the parameters of the flow and its QoS that do not conform to
              the authorized limits requires contacting the AE for authorization.</t>

            <t>The QAA message contains authorized parameters of the flow and its QoS. The rules
              that determine whether parameters&rsquo; changes require re-authorization are
              agreed out of band, based on a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the domains of
              the NE and the AE.</t>

            <t>The QAA message contains the authorized parameters of the flow and its QoS. Any
              change or request for change of these parameters requires contacting the AE for
              re-authorization.</t>

            <t>In addition to the authorized parameters of the flow and its QoS, the QAA message
              contains policy rules that determine the NEs actions in case of a change or a request for
              change in authorized parameters.</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>Provided options are not exhaustive. Elaborating on any of the listed approaches is
          deployment/solution specific and is not considered in the current document.</t>

        <t>In addition, the AE may use an RAR (Re-Authorization-Request) to perform re-authorization
          with the authorized parameters directly when the re-authorization is triggered by service
          request or local events/policy rules.</t>

        <section title="Client-Side Initiated Re-Authorization">

            the QAR MAY be triggered when the NE receives a QoS signaling message that requires

          <t>The authorization session for an installed QoS reservation state MAY be terminated by
            the Diameter client by sending a Session-Termination-Request (STR) message to the

        successful QoS reservation and activation of the data flow (see Figures <xref
          target="fig-initial-qos-request-pull" format="counter"/> and <xref target="fig-initial-qos-request-push" format="counter"
        />). After every successful re-authorization procedure (see Figures <xref
          target="fig-qos-request-re-authz" format="counter"/> and <xref target="fig-qos-re-auth-server-side" format="counter"/>), the
        NE MAY initiate an interim accounting message exchange. After successful session termination
        (see Figures <xref target="fig-client-termination" format="counter"/> and <xref target="fig-server-termination" format="counter"/>),
        the NE may initiate a final exchange of accounting messages for the termination of the
        accounting session and report final records for the use of the QoS resources reserved.
        It should be noted that the two sessions (authorization and accounting) have independent
        management by the Diameter base protocol, which allows for finalizing the accounting session
        after the end of the authorization session.</t>

        <t>This section presents an example of the interaction between the end-host and Diameter QoS
          application entities using Pull mode. The application-layer signaling is, in this example,
          provided using SIP. Signaling for a QoS resource reservation is done using the QoS 	NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP).
          The authorization of the QoS reservation request is done by the Diameter QoS application
            (DQA).<figure anchor="fig-example-pull" title="QoS Authorization Example - Pull Mode">

        <t>The communication starts with SIP signaling between the two endpoints and the SIP proxy
          for negotiation and authorization of the requested service and its parameters (see <xref
            target="fig-example-pull"/>). As a part of the process, the SIP proxy verifies whether
          the user at Host A is authorized to use the requested service (and potentially the ability
          to be charged for the service usage). Negotiated session parameters are provided to the
          end-host.</t>

        <t>Subsequently, Host A initiates a QoS signaling message towards Host B. It sends a QoS
          NSLP Reserve message, in which it includes description of the required QoS (QSPEC object)
          and authorization data for negotiated service session (part of the POLICY_DATA object).
          Authorization data includes, as a minimum, the identity of the AE (e.g., the SIP proxy)
          and an identifier of the application-service session for which QoS resources are
          requested.</t>

        <t>A QoS NSLP reserve message is intercepted and processed by the first QoS-aware Network
          Element. The NE uses the Diameter QoS application to request authorization for the
          received QoS reservation request. The identity of the AE (in this case, the SIP server that
          is co-located with a Diameter server) is put into the Destination-Host AVP, any additional
          session authorization data is encapsulated into the QoS-Authorization-Data AVP, and the
          description of the QoS resources is included into the QoS-Resources AVP. These AVPs are
          included into a QoS Authorization Request message, which is sent to the AE.</t>

        <t>A QAR message will be routed through the AAA network to the AE. The AE verifies the
          requested QoS against the QoS resources negotiated for the service session and replies
          with a QoS-Authorization-Answer (QAA) message. It carries the authorization result
          (Result-Code AVP) and the description of the authorized QoS parameters (QoS-Resources
          AVP), as well as duration of the authorization session (Authorization-Lifetime AVP).</t>

        <t>The NE interacts with the Traffic Control function and installs the authorized QoS
          resources and forwards the QoS NSLP reserve message farther along the data path. Moreover,
          the NE may serve as a signaling proxy and process the QoS signaling (e.g., initiation or
          termination of QoS signaling) based on the QoS decision received from the Authorizing
          Entity.</t>

      <section anchor="example_pull2" title="Example Call Flow for Pull Mode (Failure Case)">
        <t>This section repeats the scenario outlined in <xref target="example_pull"/>; however, in this case, we show a session authorization failure instead of success.  Failures can occur in various steps throughout the protocol
          execution, and in this example, we assume that the Diameter QAR request processed by the
          Diameter server leads to an unsuccessful result. The QAA message responds, in this example,
          with a permanent error "DIAMETER_AUTHORIZATION_REJECTED" (5003) set in the Result-Code AVP.
          When the NE receives this response, it discontinues the QoS reservation signaling
          downstream and provides an error message back to the end-host that initiated the QoS
          signaling request. The QoS NSLP response signaling message would in this case carry an
          INFO_SPEC object indicating the permanent failure as "Authorization failure" (0x02). </t>

          application entities using Push mode. The application-layer signaling is, in this example,
          provided using SIP. Signaling for a QoS resource reservation is done using the QoS NSLP.
          The authorization of the QoS reservation request is done by the Diameter QoS application
            (DQA).<figure anchor="fig-example-push" title="QoS Authorization Example - Push Mode">

        <t>The communication starts with SIP signaling between the two endpoints and the SIP proxy
          for negotiation and authorization of the requested service and its parameters (see <xref
            target="fig-example-push"/>). As a part of the process, the SIP proxy verifies whether
          the user at Host A is authorized to use the requested service (and potentially the ability
          to be charged for the service usage).</t>

        <t>A few implementation choices exist regarding the decision about when to initiate the QoS
          reservation. <xref target="MMUSIC-MEDIA"/> discusses this aspect
          with a focus on firewalling. In the example above, the DQA server is triggered to authorize
          the QoS request based on session parameters from the Session Description Protocol (SDP) payload. It will use a QIR
          message to do so. For this example message flow, we assume a two-stage commit, i.e., the SIP
          proxy interacts with the NE twice. First, it only prepares the QoS reservation, and then,
          with the arrival of the 200 OK, the QoS reservation is activated. </t>

        <t>This example does not describe how the DQA server learns which DQA client to contact. We
          assume pre-configuration in this example. In any case, the address of the DQA client is put
          into the Destination-Host AVP, the description of the QoS resources is included into
          the QoS-Resources AVP, and the duration of the authorization session is carried in the
          Authorization-Lifetime AVP. </t>

        <t>When the DQA client receives the QIR, it interacts with the Traffic Control function and
          reserves the authorized QoS resources accordingly. At this point in time, the QoS
          reservation is not yet activated. </t>

        <t>When a 200 OK is returned, the DQA server may verify the accepted QoS against the
          pre-authorized QoS resources and send a Diameter RAR message to the DQA client in the NE
          for activating the installed policies and commit the resource allocation.</t>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document describes a mechanism for performing authorization of a QoS reservation at a
        third-party entity. The Authorizing Entity needs sufficient information to make such an
        authorization decision and this information may come from various sources, including the
        application-layer signaling, the Diameter protocol (with its security mechanisms), policy information stored available with a AAA server, and a QoS signaling protocol.</t>

      <t>Below there is a discussion about considerations for the Diameter QoS interaction between
        an Authorizing Entity and a Network Element. Security between the Authorizing Entity and the
        Network Element has a number of components: authentication, authorization, integrity, and
        confidentiality.</t>

      <t>Authentication refers to confirming the identity of an originator for all datagrams
        received from the originator. Lack of authentication of Diameter messages between the
        Authorizing Entity and the Network Element can seriously jeopardize the fundamental service
        rendered by the Network Element. A consequence of not authenticating the message sender by
        the Network Element would be that an attacker could spoof the identity of a "legitimate"
        Authorizing Entity in order to allocate resources, change resource assignments, or free
        resources. The adversary can also manipulate the state at the Network Element in such a way
        that it leads to a denial-of-service attack by, for example, setting the allowed bandwidth
        to zero or allocating the entire bandwidth available to a single flow.</t>

      <t>A consequence of not authenticating the Network Element to an Authorizing Entity is that an
        attacker could impact the policy-based admission control procedure operated by the
        Authorizing Entity that provides a wrong view of the resources used in the network. Failing
        to provide the required credentials should be subject to logging.</t>

      <t>Authorization refers to whether a particular Authorizing Entity is authorized to signal a
        Network Element with requests for one or more applications, adhering to a certain policy
        profile. Failing the authorization process might indicate a resource theft attempt or
        failure due to administrative and/or credential deficiencies. In either case, the Network
        Element should take the proper measures to log such attempts.</t>

      <t>Integrity is required to ensure that a Diameter message has not been maliciously altered.
        The result of a lack of data integrity enforcement in an untrusted environment could be that
        an imposter will alter the messages exchanged between a Network Entity and an Authorizing
        Entity potentially causing a denial of service.</t>

      <t>Confidentiality protection of Diameter messages ensures that the signaling data is
        accessible only to the authorized entities. When signaling messages from the Application
        Server (via the Authorizing Entity towards the Network Element) traverse untrusted networks,
        lack of confidentiality will allow eavesdropping and traffic analysis. Additionally,
        Diameter QoS messages may carry authorization tokens that require confidentiality
        protection.</t>

      <t>Diameter offers security mechanisms to deal with the functionality demanded in the
        paragraphs above. In particular, Diameter offers communication security between neighboring
        Diameter peers using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or IPsec. Authorization capabilities are
        application specific and part of the overall implementation.</t>

<abstract><t>This specification describes the NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP) for signaling QoS reservations in the Internet.  It is in accordance with the framework and requirements developed in NSIS.  Together with GIST, it provides functionality similar to RSVP and extends it.  The QoS NSLP is independent of the underlying QoS specification or architecture and provides support for different reservation models. It is simplified by the elimination of support for multicast flows. This specification explains the overall protocol approach, design decisions made and provides examples.  It specifies object, message formats and processing rules.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>This document specifies protocol stacks for the routing and transport of per-flow signaling messages along the path taken by that flow through the network.  The design uses existing transport and security protocols under a common messaging layer, the General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST), which provides a common service for diverse signaling applications.  GIST does not handle signaling application state itself, but manages its own internal state and the configuration of the underlying transport and security protocols to enable the transfer of messages in both directions along the flow path.  The combination of GIST and the lower layer transport and security protocols provides a solution for the base protocol component of the "Next Steps in Signaling" framework.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>Middleboxes are defined as any intermediary box performing functions apart from normal, standard functions of an IP router on the data path between a source host and destination host.  Two such functions are network address translation and firewalling.  When Application Layer Gateways, such as SIP entities, interact with NATs and firewalls, as described in the MIDCOM architecture, then problems may occur in the transport of media traffic when signaling protocol interaction takes place along the media path, as it is the case for recent key exchange proposals (such as DTLS-SRTP).  This document highlights problems that may arise.  Unfortunately, it is difficult for the end points to detect or predict problematic behavior and to determine whether the media path is reliably available for packet exchange.  This document aims to summarize the various sources and effects of NAT and firewall control, the reasons that they exist, and possible means of improving their behavior to allow protocols that rely upon signaling along the media path to operate effectively.</t></abstract>
