   This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for
   use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   This document proposes an extension to the GBOND-MIB module
   with a set of objects for managing ATM-based multi-pair bonded
   xDSL interfaces, as defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.998.1.

<section title="Introduction">
  <t>
   ATM-Based Multi-Pair Bonding, a.k.a.&nbsp;G.Bond/ATM, is specified
   in ITU-T Recommendation G.998.1 <xref target="G.998.1"/>, which
   defines a method for bonding (or aggregating) multiple xDSL lines
   (or individual bearer channels in multiple xDSL lines) into a single
   bidirectional logical link carrying an ATM stream.
  </t>
  <t>
   This specification can be viewed as an evolution of the legacy
   Inverse Multiplexing for ATM (IMA) technology
   <xref target="AF-PHY-0086"/>, applied to xDSL with
   variable rates on each line/bearer channel.
   As with the other bonding schemes, ATM bonding also allows bonding of up 
   to 32 individual sub-layers with variable rates, providing common 
   functionality for the configuration, initialization, operation, and 
   monitoring of the bonded link.
  </t>
  <t>
   The MIB module defined in this document defines a set of managed
   objects for the management of G.998.1 bonded interfaces, extending the
   common objects specified in the GBOND-MIB module <xref target="RFC6765"/>.
  </t>
</section>

<section title="The Internet-Standard Management Framework">
  <t>
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to
   section 7 of RFC 3410 <xref target="RFC3410"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
   termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are
   generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol
   (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms
   defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This
   memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which
   is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 <xref target="RFC2578"/>,
   STD 58, RFC 2579 <xref target="RFC2579"/> and STD 58, RFC
   2580 <xref target="RFC2580"/>.

<section title="The Broadband Forum Management Framework for xDSL Bonding">
  <t>
   This document makes use of the Broadband Forum technical report
   "Management Framework for xDSL Bonding" <xref target="TR-159"/>,
   defining a management model and a hierarchy of management objects
   for the bonded xDSL interfaces. 
  </t>
</section>

<section title="Relationship to Other MIB Modules">
  <t>
   This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in
   this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
   Specifically, the following MIB modules are discussed: the
   Interfaces Group MIB (IF-MIB) and the G.Bond MIB (GBOND-MIB).
  </t>

  <section title="Relationship to Interfaces Group MIB Module">
   <t>
    A G.Bond/ATM port is a private case of a bonded multi-pair xDSL
    interface and as such is managed using generic interface management
    objects defined in the IF-MIB <xref target="RFC2863"/>. In
    particular, an interface index (ifIndex) is used to index instances of
    G.Bond/ATM ports, as well as xDSL lines/channels, in a managed system.
   </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Relationship to G.Bond MIB Module">
   <t>
    The GBOND-MIB module <xref target="RFC6765"/>
    defines management objects common for all bonded multi-pair
    xDSL interfaces. In particular, it describes the bonding management,
    bonded port and channel configuration, initialization sequence, etc.
   </t>
   <t>
    Both the GBOND-MIB and G9981-MIB modules are REQUIRED to manage
    a G.Bond/ATM port.
   </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Relationship to ATM MIB Module">
    <t>
     The ATM-MIB <xref target="RFC2515"/> module defines management
     objects for an ATM interface.
    </t>
    <t>
     The ATM-MIB module can be used to manage the ATM aspects of a
     G.Bond/ATM port.
    </t>
  </section>
 </section>

 <section title="MIB Structure">
  <section title="Overview">
   <t>
    All management objects defined in the G9981-MIB module are
    contained in a single group g9981Port. This group is further
    split into 4 sub-groups, structured as recommended by RFC 4181
    <xref target="RFC4181"/>:

    <list style="symbols">
     <t>
      g9981PortNotifications - containing notifications
      (Up/Downstream Differential Delay Tolerance Exceeded). 
     </t>
     <t>
      g9981PortConfTable - containing objects for configuration of
      a G.Bond/ATM port. 
     </t>
     <t>
      g9981PortStatusTable - containing objects providing overall status
      information of a G.Bond/ATM port, complementing the generic
      status information from the ifTable of the IF-MIB and
      the gBondFltStatus of the GBOND-MIB. 
     </t>
     <t>
      g9981PM - containing objects providing historical Performance
      Monitoring (PM) information of a G.Bond/ATM port, complementing
      the PM information from the gBondPortPM of the GBOND-MIB.
     </t>
    </list>
    Note that the rest of the objects for the Generic Bonding
    Sub-layer (GBS) port configuration, capabilities, status,
    notifications, and Performance Monitoring are located in the GBOND-MIB
    module.
   </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Performance Monitoring">
    <t>
     The OPTIONAL Performance Monitoring counters, thresholds, and history
     buckets (interval-counters) are implemented using the textual
     conventions defined in the
     HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB <xref target="RFC3705"/>. The
     HC&nbhy;PerfHist-TC-MIB defines 64-bit versions of the textual
     conventions found in the PerfHist-TC-MIB <xref target="RFC3593"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
     The agent SHOULD align the beginning of each interval to a
     fifteen-minute boundary of a wall clock. Likewise, the beginning of each
     one-day interval SHOULD be aligned with the start of a day.
    </t>
    <t>
     Counters are not reset when a GBS is re-initialized, but rather only
     when the agent is reset or re-initialized.
    </t>
    <t>
     Note that the accumulation of certain performance events for a
     monitored entity is inhibited (counting stops) during periods of
     service unavailability on that entity. The DESCRIPTION
     clause of Performance Monitoring counters in this MIB module
     specifies which of the counters are inhibited during periods of
     service unavailability.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Mapping of Broadband Forum TR-159 Managed Objects">
   <t>
    This section contains the mapping between relevant managed objects
    (attributes) defined in <xref target="TR-159"/> and the managed
    objects defined in this document.
   </t>

    <c>nIMADownDiffDelayToleranceExceeded</c>  <c>g9981DnDiffDelayToleranceExceeded</c>
   </texttable>

  <t>
   Note that some of the mapping between the objects defined in TR-159
   and the ones defined in this MIB module is not one-to-one; for
   example, while TR-159 PM attributes aGroupPerf* map to the
   corresponding gBondPortPm* objects of the GBOND-MIB module, there are
   no dedicated PM attributes for the g9981PortPm* objects introduced in
   this MIB module.  However, since their definition is identical to the
   definition of gBondPortPm* objects of the GBOND-MIB module, we can
   map g9981PortPm* to the relevant aGroupPerf* attributes of TR-159 and
   use the term 'partial mapping' to denote the fact that this mapping
   is not one-to-one.

 <section title="Security Considerations">

  <t>
  There are a number of managed objects defined in this MIB module
  with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write. Such
  objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
  environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure
  environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
  network operations. These are the tables and objects and their
  sensitivity/vulnerability:

  <list style='symbols'>
   <t>
    Changing of g9981PortConfTable configuration parameters
    MAY lead to a potential Service Level Agreement (SLA) breach,
    for example, if a traffic delay is increased as a result of the
    higher delay tolerance (increased g9981PortConfUpDiffDelayTolerance
    and/or g9981PortConfDnDiffDelayTolerance), or the differential delay
    tolerance notifications are disabled by manipulating the
    g9981PortConfDiffDelayToleranceExceededEnable parameter.
   </t>
  </list>
 </t>
 <t>
  Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
  MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
  vulnerable in some network environments since, collectively, they provide
  information about the performance of network interfaces and can reveal
  some aspects of their configuration.
 </t>
 <t>
  It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these
  objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending
  them over the network via SNMP.
 </t>
 <t>
  SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
  Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
  there is no control as to who on the secure network is
  allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
  in this MIB module.
 </t>
 <t>
  Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
  SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"/>), and implementations
  claiming compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support
  for authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
  <xref target="RFC3414"/> with the AES cipher algorithm
  <xref target="RFC3826"/>.
  Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model
  (TSM) <xref target="RFC5591"/> in combination with a secure transport such
  as SSH <xref target="RFC5592"/> or TLS/DTLS <xref target="RFC6353"/>.
 </t>
 <t>
  Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
  RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
  enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
  instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
  the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
  rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
 </t>
</section>

 <section title="IANA Considerations">
  <t>
   IANA has assigned 208 as the object identifier for g9981MIB MODULE-IDENTITY
   in the MIB-2 transmission sub-tree <eref target='http://www.iana.org/'/>.
