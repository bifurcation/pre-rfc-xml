    <abstract>
      <t>The use of right-to-left scripts in Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)
      has presented several challenges. This memo provides a new Bidi rule for
      Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA) labels, based on the encountered problems with some scripts and
      some shortcomings in the 2003 IDNA Bidi criterion.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <section title="Purpose and Applicability">
        <t>The purpose of this document is to establish a rule that can be
        applied to Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) labels in Unicode form
        (U-labels) containing characters from scripts that are written from
        right to left. It is part of the revised IDNA protocol <xref
target="RFC5891"/>.
</t> 

        <t>When labels satisfy the rule, and when certain other conditions are
        satisfied, there is only a minimal chance of these labels being
        displayed in a confusing way by the Unicode bidirectional display
        algorithm.</t>

        <t>The other normative documents in the IDNA2008 document set
        establish criteria for valid labels, including listing the permitted
        characters. This document establishes additional validity criteria for
        labels in scripts normally written from right to left.</t>

        <t>This specification is not intended to place any requirements on
        domain names that do not contain characters from such scripts.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Background and History">
        <t>The "Stringprep" specification <xref target="RFC3454"></xref>, part
        of IDNA2003, made the following statement in its Section 6 on the Bidi
        algorithm:<list style="empty">

            <t>3) If a string contains any RandALCat character, a RandALCat
            character MUST be the first character of the string, and a
            RandALCat character MUST be the last character of the string.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>(A RandALCat character is a character with unambiguously
        right-to-left directionality.)</t>

        <t>The reasoning behind this prohibition was to ensure that every
        component of a displayed domain name has an unambiguously preferred
        direction. However, this made certain words in languages written with
        right-to-left scripts invalid as IDN labels, and in at least one case
        (Dhivehi) meant that all the words of an entire language were
        forbidden as IDN labels.</t>

        <t>This is illustrated below with examples taken from the Dhivehi and
        Yiddish languages, as written with the Thaana and Hebrew scripts,
        respectively.</t>

        <t>RFC 3454 did not explicitly state the requirement to be fulfilled.
        Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether a simple relaxation
        of the rule would continue to fulfill the requirement.</t>

        <t>While this document specifies rules quite different from RFC 3454,
        most reasonable labels that were allowed under RFC 3454 will also be
        allowed under this specification (the most important example of
        non-permitted labels being labels that mix Arabic and European digits
        (AN and EN) inside an RTL label, and labels that use AN in an LTR
        label -- see <xref target="terminology"></xref> for
        terminology), so the operational impact of using the new rule in the
        updated IDNA specification is limited.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Structure of the Rest of This Document">
        <t><xref target="rule"></xref> defines a rule, the "Bidi rule", which
        can be used on a domain name label to check how safe it is to use in a
        domain name of possibly mixed directionality. The primary initial use
        of this rule is as part of the IDNA2008 protocol <xref target="RFC5891"/>.</t>

        <t><xref target="requirement"></xref> sets out the requirements for
        defining the Bidi rule.</t>

        <t><xref target="issues"></xref> gives detailed examples that serve as
        justification for the new rule.</t>

        <t><xref target="trouble"></xref> to <xref target="Security"></xref>
        describe various situations that can occur when dealing with domain
        names with characters of different directionality.</t>

        <t>Only <xref target="terminology"></xref> and <xref
        target="rule"></xref> are normative.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
        <t>The terminology used to describe IDNA concepts is defined in <xref target="RFC5890">the Definitions document</xref>.</t>

        <t>The terminology used for the Bidi properties of Unicode characters
        is taken from the Unicode Standard <xref target="Unicode52"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The Unicode Standard specifies a Bidi property for each character.
        That property controls the character's behavior in the Unicode bidirectional
        algorithm <xref target="Unicode-UAX9"></xref>. For reference, here are the
        values that the Unicode Bidi property can have: <list style="symbols">
            <t>L - Left to right - most letters in LTR scripts</t>

            <t>R - Right to left - most letters in non-Arabic RTL scripts</t>

            <t>AL - Arabic letters - most letters in the Arabic script</t>

            <t>EN - European Number (0-9, and Extended Arabic-Indic
            numbers)</t>

            <t>ES - European Number Separator (+ and -)</t>

            <t>ET - European Number Terminator (currency symbols, the hash
            sign, the percent sign and so on)</t>

            <t>AN - Arabic Number; this encompasses the Arabic-Indic numbers,
            but not the Extended Arabic-Indic numbers</t>

            <t>CS - Common Number Separator (. , / : et al)</t>

            <t>NSM - Nonspacing Mark - most combining accents</t>

            <t>BN - Boundary Neutral - control characters (ZWNJ, ZWJ, and
            others)</t>

            <t>B - Paragraph Separator</t>

            <t>S - Segment Separator</t>

            <t>WS - Whitespace, including the SPACE character</t>

            <t>ON - Other Neutrals, including @, &amp;, parentheses, MIDDLE
            DOT</t>

            <t>LRE, LRO, RLE, RLO, PDF - these are "directional control
            characters" and are not used in IDNA labels.
</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In this memo, we use "network order" to describe the sequence of
        characters as transmitted on the wire or stored in a file; the terms
        "first", "next", "previous", "beginning", "end", "before", and "after"
        are used to refer to the relationship of characters and labels in
        network order.</t>

        <t>We use "display order" to talk about the sequence of characters as
        imaged on a display medium; the terms "left" and "right" are used to
        refer to the relationship of characters and labels in display
        order.</t>

        <t>Most of the time, the examples use the abbreviations for the
        Unicode Bidi classes to denote the directionality of the characters;
        the example string CS L consists of one character of class CS and one
        character of class L.&nbsp; In some examples, the convention that uppercase
        characters are of class R or AL, and lowercase characters are of class
        L is used -- thus, the example string ABC.abc would consist of three
        right-to-left characters and three left-to-right characters.</t>

        <t>The directionality of such examples is determined by context -- for
        instance, in the sentence "ABC.abc is displayed as CBA.abc", the first
        example string is in network order, the second example string is in
        display order.</t>

        <t>The term "paragraph" is used in the sense of the Unicode Bidi
        specification <xref target="Unicode-UAX9"></xref>. It means "a block of text
        that has an overall direction, either left to right or right to left",
        approximately; see the "Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm" <xref target="Unicode-UAX9"></xref> for details.</t>

        <t>"RTL" and "LTR" are abbreviations for "right to left" and "left to
        right", respectively.</t>

        <t>An RTL label is a label that contains at least one character of
        type R, AL, or AN.</t>

        <t>An LTR label is any label that is not an RTL label.</t>

        <t>A "Bidi domain name" is a domain name that contains at least one
        RTL label. (Note: This definition includes domain names containing
        only dots and right-to-left characters. Providing a separate category
        of "RTL domain names" would not make this specification simpler, so
        it has not been done.)</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="rule" title="The Bidi Rule">
      <t>The following rule, consisting of six conditions, applies to labels
      in Bidi domain names. The requirements that this rule satisfies are
      described in <xref target="requirement"></xref>. All of the conditions must
      be satisfied for the rule to be satisfied.</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">

          <t>The first character must be a character with Bidi property L, R,
          or AL.&nbsp; If it has the R or AL property, it is an RTL label; if it has
          the L property, it is an LTR label.</t>

          <t>In an RTL label, only characters with the Bidi properties R, AL,
          AN, EN, ES, CS, ET, ON, BN, or NSM are allowed.</t>

          <t>In an RTL label, the end of the label must be a character with
          Bidi property R, AL, EN, or AN, followed by zero or more characters
          with Bidi property NSM.</t>

          <t>In an RTL label, if an EN is present, no AN may be present, and
          vice versa.</t>

          <t>In an LTR label, only characters with the Bidi properties L, EN,
          ES, CS, ET, ON, BN, or NSM are allowed.</t>

          <t>In an LTR label, the end of the label must be a character with
          Bidi property L or EN, followed by zero or more characters with Bidi

        </list>The following guarantees can be made based on the above:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>In a domain name consisting of only labels that satisfy the rule,
          the requirements of <xref target="requirement"></xref> are

          be tested.</t>

          <t>In a domain name consisting of only LDH labels (as defined in
<xref target="RFC5890">the Definitions document</xref>) and labels that
          satisfy the rule, the requirements of <xref
          target="requirement"></xref> are satisfied as long as a label that
          starts with an ASCII digit does not come after a right-to-left
          label.</t>
        </list>No guarantee is given for other combinations.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="requirement"
             title="The Requirement Set for the Bidi Rule">
      <t>This document, unlike RFC 3454 <xref target="RFC3454"></xref>, provides an explicit justification
      for the Bidi rule, and states a set of requirements for which it is
      possible to test whether or not the modified rule fulfills the
      requirement.</t>

      <t>All the text in this document assumes that text containing the labels
      under consideration will be displayed using the Unicode bidirectional
      algorithm <xref target="Unicode-UAX9"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The requirements proposed are these:<list style="symbols">

          <t>Label Uniqueness: No two labels, when presented in display order
          in the same paragraph, should have the same sequence of characters
          without also having the same sequence of characters in network
          order, both when the paragraph has LTR direction and when the
          paragraph has RTL direction. (This is the criterion that is explicit
          in RFC 3454). (Note that a label displayed in an RTL paragraph may
          display the same as a different label displayed in an LTR paragraph
          and still satisfy this criterion.)</t>

          <t>Character Grouping: When displaying a string of labels, using the
          Unicode Bidi algorithm to reorder the characters for display, the
          characters of each label should remain grouped between the
          characters delimiting the labels, both when the string is embedded
          in a paragraph with LTR direction and when it is embedded in a
          paragraph with RTL direction.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Several stronger statements were considered and rejected, because
      they seem to be impossible to fulfill within the constraints of the
      Unicode bidirectional algorithm. These include:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The appearance of a label should be unaffected by its embedding
          context. This proved impossible even for ASCII labels; the label
          "123-A" will have a different display order in an RTL context than
          in an LTR context. (This particular example is, however, disallowed
          anyway.)</t>

          <t>The sequence of labels should be consistent with network order.
          This proved impossible -- a domain name consisting of the labels (in
          network order) L1.R2.R3.L4 will be displayed as L1.R3.R2.L4 in an
          LTR context. (In an RTL context, it will be displayed as
          L4.R3.R2.L1).</t>

          <t>No two domain names should be displayed the same, even under
          differing directionality. This was shown to be unsound, since the
          domain name (in network order) ABC.abc will have display order
          CBA.abc in an LTR context and abc.CBA in an RTL context, while the
          domain name (network) abc.ABC will have display order abc.CBA in an
          LTR context and CBA.abc in an RTL context.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>One possible requirement was thought to be problematic, but turned
      out to be satisfied by a string that obeys the proposed rules:
</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The Character Grouping requirement should be satisfied when
          directional controls (LRE, RLE, RLO, LRO, PDF) are used in the same
          paragraph (outside of the labels). Because these controls affect
          presentation order in non-obvious ways, by affecting the "sor" and
          "eor" properties of the Unicode Bidi algorithm, the conditions above
          require extra testing in order to figure out whether or not they
          influence the display of the domain name. Testing found that for the
          strings allowed under the rule presented in this document,
          directional controls do not influence the display of the domain
          name.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This is still not stated as a requirement, since it did not seem as
      important as the stated requirements, but it is useful to know that Bidi domain
      names where the labels satisfy the rule have this property.</t>

      <t>In the following descriptions, first-level bullets are used to
      indicate rules or normative statements; second-level bullets are
      commentary.</t>

      <t>The Character Grouping requirement can be more formally stated
      as:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Let "Delimiterchars" be a set of characters with the Unicode Bidi
          properties CS, WS, ON. (These are commonly used to delimit labels --
          both the FULL STOP and the space are included. They are not allowed
          in domain labels.) <list style="symbols">
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
              <t>ET, though it commonly occurs next to domain names in
              practice, is problematic: the context R CS L EN ET (for instance
              A.a1%) makes the label L EN not satisfy the character grouping
              requirement.</t>

              <t>ES commonly occurs in labels as HYPHEN-MINUS, but could also
              be used as a delimiter (for instance, the plus sign). It is left
              out here.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Let "unproblematic label" be a label that either satisfies the
          requirements or does not contain any character with the Bidi
          properties R, AL, or AN and does not begin with a character with the
          Bidi property EN. (Informally, "it does not start with a
          number".)</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>A label X satisfies the Character Grouping requirement when, for any
      Delimiter Character D1 and D2, and for any label S1 and S2 that is an
      unproblematic label or an empty string, the following holds true:</t>

      <t>If the string formed by concatenating S1, D1, X, D2, and S2 is
      reordered according to the Bidi algorithm, then all the characters of X
      in the reordered string are between D1 and D2, and no other characters
      are between D1 and D2, both if the overall paragraph direction is LTR
      and if the overall paragraph direction is RTL.</t>

      <t>Note that the definition is self-referential, since S1 and S2 are
      constrained to be "legal" by this definition. This makes testing changes
      to proposed rules a little complex, but does not create problems for
      testing whether or not a given proposed rule satisfies the
      criterion.</t>

      <t>The "zero-length" case represents the case where a domain name is
      next to something that isn't a domain name, separated by a delimiter
      character.</t>

      <t>Note about the position of BN: The Unicode bidirectional algorithm
      specifies that a BN has an effect on the adjoining characters in network
      order, not in display order, and are therefore treated as if removed
      during Bidi processing (<xref target="Unicode-UAX9"></xref>, Section 3.3.2, rule
      X9 and Section 5.3). Therefore, the question of "what position does a BN
      have after reordering" is not meaningful. It has been ignored while
      developing the rules here.</t>

      <t>The Label Uniqueness requirement can be formally stated as:</t>

      <t>If two non-identical labels X and Y, embedded as for the test above,
      displayed in paragraphs with the same directionality, are reordered by
      the Bidi algorithm into the same sequence of code points, the labels X
      and Y cannot both be legal.

      <section title="Yiddish">
        <t>Yiddish is one of several languages written with the Hebrew script
        (others include Hebrew and Ladino). This is basically a consonantal
        alphabet (also termed an "abjad"), but Yiddish is written using an
        extended form that is fully vocalic. The vowels are indicated in
        several ways, one of which is by repurposing letters that are
        consonants in Hebrew. Other letters are used both as vowels and
        consonants, with combining marks, called "points", used to
        differentiate between them. Finally, some base characters can indicate
        several different vowels, which are also disambiguated by combining
        marks. Pointed characters can appear in word-final position and may
        therefore also be needed at the end of labels. This is not an
        invariable attribute of a Yiddish string and there is thus greater
        latitude here than there is with Dhivehi.</t>

        <t>The organization now known as the "YIVO Institute for Jewish
        Research" developed orthographic rules for modern Standard Yiddish
        during the 1930s on the basis of work conducted in several venues
        since earlier in that century. These are given in, "The Standardized
        Yiddish Orthography: Rules of Yiddish Spelling" <xref
        target="SYO"></xref>, and are taken as normatively descriptive of
        modern Standard Yiddish in any context where that notion is deemed
        relevant. They have been applied exclusively in all formal Yiddish
        dictionaries published since their establishment, and are similarly
        dominant in academic and bibliographic regards.</t>

        <t>It therefore appears appropriate for this repertoire also to be
        supported fully by IDNA. This presents no difficulty with characters
        in initial and medial positions, but pointed characters are regularly
        used in final position as well. All of the characters in the SYO
        repertoire appear in both marked and unmarked form with one exception:
        the HEBREW LETTER PE (U+05E4). The SYO only permits this with a HEBREW
        POINT DAGESH (U+05BC), providing the Yiddish equivalent to the Latin
        letter "p", or a HEBREW POINT RAFE (U+05BF), equivalent to the Latin
        letter "f". There is, however, a separate unpointed allograph, the
        HEBREW LETTER FINAL PE (U+05E3), for the latter character when it
        appears in final position. The constraint on the use of the SYO
        repertoire resulting from the proscription of combining marks at the
        end of RTL strings thus reduces to nothing more, or less, than the
        equivalent of saying that a string of Latin characters cannot end with
        the letter "p". It must also be noted that the HEBREW LETTER PE with the
        HEBREW POINT DAGESH is characteristic of almost all traditional
        Yiddish orthographies that predate (or remain in use in parallel to)
        the SYO, being the first pointed character to appear in any of
        them.</t>

        <t>A more general instantiation of the basic problem can be seen in
        the representation of the YIVO acronym. This acronym is written with
        the Hebrew letters YOD YOD HIRIQ VAV VAV ALEF QAMATS, where HIRIQ and
        QAMATS are combining points. The Unicode code points are: <list>
            <t>U+05D9 HEBREW LETTER YOD (R)</t>

            <t>U+05B4 HEBREW POINT HIRIQ (NSM)</t>

            <t>U+05D5 HEBREW LETTER VAV (R)</t>

            <t>U+05D0 HEBREW LETTER ALEF (R)</t>

            <t>U+05B8 HEBREW POINT QAMATS (NSM)</t>
          </list> The directionality class of U+05B8 HEBREW POINT QAMATS in
        the Unicode database is NSM, which again causes the IDNA2003 algorithm
        to reject the string.</t>

        <t>It may also be noted that all of the combined characters mentioned
        above exist in precomposed form at separate positions in the Unicode
        chart. However, by invoking Stringprep, the IDNA2003 algorithm also
        rejects those code points, for reasons not discussed here.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Strings with Numbers">
        <t>By requiring that the first or last character of a string be a
member of category R or AL, 
the Stringprep specification <xref target="RFC3454"></xref> prohibited a string containing
        right-to-left characters from ending with a number.</t>

        <t>Consider the strings ALEF 5 (HEBREW LETTER ALEF + DIGIT FIVE) and 5
        ALEF. Displayed in an LTR context, the first one will be displayed
        from left to right as 5 ALEF (with the 5 being considered
        right to left because of the leading ALEF), while 5 ALEF will be
        displayed in exactly the same order (5 taking the direction from
        context). Clearly, only one of those should be permitted as a
        registered label, but barring them both seems unnecessary.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="trouble" title="Troublesome Situations and Guidelines">
      <t>There are situations in which labels that satisfy the rule above will
      be displayed in a surprising fashion. The most important of these is the
      case where a label ending in a character with Bidi property AL, AN, or R
      occurs before a label beginning with a character of Bidi property EN. In
      that case, the number will appear to move into the label containing the
      right-to-left character, violating the Character Grouping
      requirement.</t>

      <t>If the label that occurs after the right-to-left label itself
      satisfies the Bidi criterion, the requirements will be satisfied in all
      cases (this is the reason why the criterion talks about strings
      containing L in some cases). However, the IDNABIS WG concluded that this could
      not be required for several reasons:
</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>There is a large current deployment of ASCII domain names
          starting with digits. These cannot possibly be invalidated.</t>

          <t>Domain names are often constructed piecemeal, for instance, by
          combining a string with the content of a search list. This may occur
          after IDNA processing, and thus in part of the code that is not
          IDNA-aware, making detection of the undesirable combination
          impossible.</t>

          <t>Even if a label is registered under a "safe" label, there may be
          a DNAME <xref target="RFC2672"></xref> with an "unsafe" label that
          points to the "safe" label, thus creating seemingly valid names that
          would not satisfy the criterion.</t>

          <t>Wildcards create the odd situation where a label is "valid" (can
          be looked up successfully) without the zone owner knowing that this
          label exists. So an owner of a zone whose name starts with a digit
          and contains a wildcard has no way of controlling whether or not
          names with RTL labels in them are looked up in his zone.</t>
        </list>Rather than trying to suggest rules that disallow all such
      undesirable situations, this document merely warns about the
      possibility, and leaves it to application developers to take whatever
      measures they deem appropriate to avoid problematic situations.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Other Issues in Need of Resolution">
      <t>This document concerns itself only with the rules that are needed
      when dealing with domain names with characters that have differing Bidi
      properties, and considers characters only in terms of their Bidi
      properties. All other issues with scripts that are written from right to
      left must be considered in other contexts.</t>

      <t>One such issue is the need to keep numbers separate. Several scripts
      are used with multiple sets of numbers -- most commonly they use Latin
      numbers and a script-specific set of numbers, but in the case of Arabic,
      there are two sets of "Arabic-Indic" digits involved.</t>

      <t>The algorithm in this document disallows occurrences of AN-class
      characters ("Arabic-Indic digits", U+0660 to U+0669) together with
      EN-class characters (which includes "European" digits, U+0030 to U+0039
      and "extended Arabic-Indic digits", U+06F0 to U+06F9), but does not help
      in preventing the mixing of, for instance, Bengali digits (U+09E6 to
      U+09EF) and Gujarati digits (U+0AE6 to U+0AEF), both of which have Bidi
      class L.&nbsp; A registry or script community that wishes to create rules
      restricting the mixing of digits in a label will be able to specify
      these restrictions at the registry level. Some rules are also specified
      at the protocol level.</t>

      <t>Another set of issues concerns the proper display of IDNs with a
      mixture of LTR and RTL labels, or only RTL labels.</t>

      <t>It is unrealistic to expect that applications will display domain
      names using embedded formatting codes between their labels (for one
      thing, no reliable algorithms for identifying domain names in running
      text exist); thus, the display order will be determined by the Bidi
      algorithm. Thus, a sequence (in network order) of R1.R2.ltr will be
      displayed in the order 2R.1R.ltr in an LTR context, which might surprise
      someone expecting to see labels displayed in hierarchical order. People
      used to working with text that mixes LTR and RTL strings might not be so
      surprised by this. Again, this memo does not attempt to suggest a
      solution to this problem.</t>

    <section title="Compatibility Considerations">
      <t></t>

      <section title="Backwards Compatibility Considerations">
        <t>As with any change to an existing standard, it is important to
        consider what happens with existing implementations when the change is
        introduced. Some troublesome cases include:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>An old program used to input the newly allowed label. If the old
            program checks the input against RFC 3454, some labels will not be
            allowed, and domain names containing those labels will remain
            inaccessible.</t>

            <t>An old program is asked to display the newly allowed label, and
            checks it against RFC 3454 before displaying. The program will
            perform some kind of fallback, most likely displaying the label in
            A-label form.</t>

            <t>An old program tries to display the newly allowed label. If the
            old program has code for displaying the last character of a label
            that is different from the code used to display the characters in
            the middle of the label, the display may be inconsistent and cause
            confusion.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>One particular example of the last case is if a program chooses to
        examine the last character (in network order) of a string in order to
        determine its directionality, rather than its first. If it finds an
        NSM character and tries to display the string as if it was a
        left-to-right string, the resulting display may be interesting, but
        not useful.</t>

        <t>The editors believe that these cases will have a less harmful impact
        in practice than continuing to deny the use of words from the
        languages for which these strings are necessary as IDN labels.</t>

        <t>This specification does not forbid using leading European digits in
        ASCII-only labels, since this would conflict with a large installed
        base of such labels, and would increase the scope of the specification
        from RTL labels to all labels. The harm resulting from this limitation
        of scope is described in <xref target="trouble"></xref>. Registries
        and private zone managers can check for this particular condition
        before they allow registration of any RTL label. Generally, it is best
        to disallow registration of any right-to-left strings in a zone where
        the label at the level above begins with a digit.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Forward Compatibility Considerations">
        <t>This text is intentionally specified strictly in terms of the
        Unicode Bidi properties. The determination that the condition is
        sufficient to fulfill the criteria depends on the Unicode Bidi
        algorithm; it is unlikely that drastic changes will be made to this
        algorithm.</t>

        <t>However, the determination of validity for any string depends on
        the Unicode Bidi property values, which are not declared immutable by
        the Unicode Consortium. Furthermore, the behavior of the algorithm
        for any given character is likely to be linguistically and culturally
        sensitive, so while it should occur rarely, it is possible that
        later versions of the Unicode Standard may change the Bidi properties
        assigned to certain Unicode characters.
</t>

        <t>This memo does not propose a solution for this problem.</t>
      </section>
    </section>


    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The display behavior of mixed-direction text can be extremely
      surprising to users who are not used to it; for instance, cut and paste
      of a piece of text can cause the text to display differently at the
      destination, if the destination is in another directionality context,
      and adding a character in one place of a text can cause characters some
      distance from the point of insertion to change their display position.
      This is, however, not a phenomenon unique to the display of domain
      names.</t>

      <t>The new IDNA protocol, and particularly these new Bidi rules, will
      allow some strings to be used in IDNA contexts that are not allowed
      today. It is possible that differences in the interpretation of labels
      between implementations of IDNA2003 and IDNA2008 could pose a security
      risk, but it is difficult to envision any specific instantiation of
      this.</t>

      <t>Any rational attempt to compute, for instance, a hash over an
      identifier processed by IDNA would use network order for its
      computation, and thus be unaffected by the new rules proposed here.</t>

      <t>While it is not believed to pose a problem, if display routines had
      been written with specific knowledge of the RFC 3454 IDNA prohibitions,
      it is possible that the potential problems noted under "Backwards
      Compatibility Considerations" could cause new kinds of confusion.</t>
