      <t>
        RFC 2119 specifies common key words that may be used in protocol specifications.
        This document aims to reduce the ambiguity by clarifying that only UPPERCASE
        usage of the key words have the defined special meanings.

      <t>
        RFC 2119 specifies common key words, such as "MUST", "SHOULD", and "MAY", that
        may be used in protocol specifications. It says that the key words
        "are often capitalized," which has caused confusion
        about how to interpret non-capitalized words such as "must" and "should".
      </t>
      <t>
        This document updates RFC 2119 by clarifying that only UPPERCASE
        usage of the key words have the defined special meanings.
        This document is part of BCP 14.

        === OLD ===
        <vspace/>
        In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
        the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
        capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
        interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
        should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
        RFC 2119.
      </t>
      <t>
        <vspace blankLines="2"/>
        === NEW ===
        <vspace/>
        In many IETF documents, several words, when they are in all
        capitals as shown below, are used to signify the requirements
        in the specification. These capitalized words can bring significant
        clarity and consistency to documents because their meanings are
        well defined. This document defines how those words are interpreted
        in IETF documents when the words are in all capitals.
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            These words can be used as defined here, but using them is not required.
            Specifically, normative text does not require the use of these key words.
            They are used for clarity and consistency when that is what's wanted,
            but a lot of normative text does not use them and is still normative.
          </t>
          <t>
            The words have the meanings specified herein only when they are in all capitals.
          </t>
          <t>
            When these words are not capitalized, they have their normal
            English meanings and are not impacted by this document.
          </t>
        </list>
        Authors who follow these guidelines should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:
        <list style="empty">
        <t>
          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
          "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
          in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
	  [RFC2119] [RFC8174]
          when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
