    <abstract>
      <t>DNS messages between clients and servers may be received
	over either UDP or TCP. UDP transport involves keeping less
	state on a busy server, but can cause truncation and retries
	over TCP. Additionally, UDP can be exploited for reflection
	attacks. Using TCP would reduce retransmits and amplification.
	However, clients commonly use TCP only for retries and servers
	typically use idle timeouts on the order of seconds.</t>

      <t>This document defines an EDNS0 option ("edns-tcp-keepalive")
	that allows DNS servers to signal a variable idle timeout.
	This signalling encourages the use of long-lived TCP connections
     by allowing the state associated with TCP transport to be managed
     effectively with minimal impact on the DNS transaction time.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>DNS messages between clients and servers may be received
        over either UDP or TCP <xref target="RFC1035"/>. Historically,
        DNS clients used APIs that only facilitated sending and receiving
        a single query over either UDP or TCP. New APIs and deployment
        of DNSSEC validating resolvers on hosts that in the past were
        using stub resolving only is increasing the DNS client base that
        prefer using long-lived TCP connections. Long-lived TCP connections
        can result in lower request latency than the case where UDP
        transport is used and truncated responses are received. This is because
        clients that retry over TCP following a
        truncated UDP response typically only use the TCP session for a
        single (request, response) pair, continuing with UDP transport
        for subsequent queries.</t>

          <t>The use of TCP transport requires state
    	to be retained on DNS servers.  If a server is to perform
    	adequately with a significant query load received over TCP,
    	it must manage its available resources to ensure that all
    	established TCP sessions are well-used, and idle connections are
    	closed after an appropriate amount of time.</t>

      <t>UDP transport is stateless, and hence presents a much
	lower resource burden on a busy DNS server than TCP. An
	exchange of DNS messages over UDP can also be completed in
	a single round trip between communicating hosts, resulting
	in optimally short transaction times. UDP transport is not
	without its risks, however.</t>

      <t>A single-datagram exchange over UDP between two hosts
	can be exploited to enable a reflection attack on a third
	party. Response Rate Limiting <xref target="RRL"/> is designed to help 
	mitigate such attacks
    against authoritative-only servers.  One feature of RRL is to let some
    amount of responses "slip" through the rate limiter.  These are returned
    with the TC (truncation) bit set, which causes legitimate clients to
    resend the same query using TCP transport.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC1035"/> specified a maximum DNS message
	size over UDP transport of 512 bytes.  Deployment of DNSSEC
	<xref target="RFC4033"/> and other protocols subsequently
	increased the observed frequency at which responses exceed
	this limit. EDNS0 <xref target="RFC6891"/> allows DNS
	messages larger than 512 bytes to be exchanged over UDP,
	with a corresponding increased incidence of fragmentation.
	Fragmentation is known to be problematic in general, and
	has also been implicated in increasing the risk of cache
	poisoning attacks <xref target="fragmentation-considered-poisonous"/>.</t>

      <t>TCP transport is less susceptible to the risks
	of fragmentation and reflection attacks. However, TCP
	transport for DNS as currently deployed has expensive setup overhead, compared
	to using UDP (when no retry is required).</t>

      <t>The overhead of the three-way TCP handshake for a single
	DNS transaction is substantial, increasing the transaction
	time for a single (request, response) pair of DNS messages
	from 1x RTT to 2x RTT. 
	There is no such overhead for a session that is already established;
	therefore, the overhead of the initial TCP handshake is minimised when
	the resulting session is used to exchange multiple DNS message pairs
	over a single session.  The extra RTT time for session setup can be
	represented as the equation (1 + N)/N, where N represents the number of
	DNS message pairs that utilize the session and the result approaches
	unity as N increases.</t>

    <t>With increased deployment of DNSSEC and new RR types containing
       application-specific cryptographic material, there is an increase
       in the prevalence of truncated responses received over UDP with
       retries over TCP. The overhead for a DNS
	transaction over UDP truncated due to RRL is 3x RTT higher
	than the overhead imposed on the same transaction initiated
	over TCP.</t>

      <t>This document proposes a signalling mechanism between DNS
	clients and servers that encourages the use of long-lived TCP connections
     by allowing the state associated with TCP transport to be managed
     effectively with minimal impact on the DNS transaction time.</t>

    <t>This mechanism will be of benefit for both stub-resolver and
        resolver-authoritative TCP connections. In the latter case, the persistent
        nature of the TCP connection can provide improved defence against attacks
        including DDoS. </t>

       <t>The reduced overhead of this extension adds up significantly
          when combined with other EDNS0 extensions, such as
           <xref target="CHAIN-QUERY"/> and <xref target="DNS-over-TLS"/>. For example, 
           the combination of
          these EDNS0 extensions make it possible for hosts on
          high-latency mobile networks to natively and efficiently perform DNSSEC
          validation and encrypt queries.

    <section title="The edns-tcp-keepalive Option" anchor="overview">
      <t>This document specifies a new <xref target="RFC6891">EDNS0</xref>
        option, edns-tcp-keepalive, which can be used by DNS clients and
        servers to signal a willingness to keep an idle TCP session open
        to conduct future DNS transactions, with the idle timeout being specified 
        by the server.
        This specification does not distinguish between different types
        of DNS client and server in the use of this option.</t>
        
        <t><xref target="RFC7766"/> defines an 'idle DNS-over-TCP session' from both
            the client and server perspective. The idle timeout described here
            begins when the idle condition is met per that definition and
            should be reset when that condition is lifted, i.e., when a client
            sends a message or when a server receives a message on an idle connection.</t>

          <t>A DNS server that receives a query using TCP transport that includes
           the edns-tcp-keepalive option MAY modify the local idle timeout

        <section title="Sending Responses">

	  <t>A DNS server that receives a query sent using TCP transport that includes an OPT
         RR (with or without the edns-tcp-keepalive option) 
         MAY include the edns-tcp-keepalive option in the response to signal the
	    expected idle timeout on a connection. Servers MUST specify the TIMEOUT value
	    that is currently associated with the TCP session. It is
	    reasonable for this value to change according to local
	    resource constraints. The DNS server SHOULD send an
	    edns-tcp-keepalive option with a timeout of 0 if it deems its local resources
	    are too low to service more TCP keepalive sessions or if it wants
	    clients to close currently open connections.</t>
	</section>
      </section>

      <section title="TCP Session Management">
	<t>Both DNS clients and servers are subject to resource
	  constraints that will limit the extent to which TCP
	  sessions can persist. Effective limits for the number of
	  active sessions that can be maintained on individual
	  clients and servers should be established, either as
	  configuration options or by interrogation of process
	  limits imposed by the operating system. Servers
	  that implement edns-tcp-keepalive should also engage in TCP connection 
	  management by recycling existing connections when appropriate, closing connections gracefully,
	  and managing request queues to enable fair use.</t>

	<t>In the event that there is greater demand for TCP sessions
	  than can be accommodated, servers may reduce
	  the TIMEOUT value signalled in successive DNS messages
	  to minimise idle time on existing sessions.  This also allows,
	  for example, clients with other candidate servers to query
	  to establish new TCP sessions with different servers in
	  expectation that an existing session is likely to be
	  closed or to fall back to UDP.</t>

   <t>Based on TCP session resources, servers may signal a
	  TIMEOUT value of 0 to request clients to close
	  connections as soon as possible. This is useful when server resources 
	  become very low or a 
	  denial-of-service attack is detected and further maximises the shifting of
	  TIME_WAIT state to well-behaved clients. </t>

	<t>However, it should be noted that RFC 6891 states:
	   <list><t>Lack of presence of an OPT record in a request MUST be taken as an
	      indication that the requestor does not implement any part of this
	      specification and that the responder MUST NOT include an OPT record
	      in its response.</t></list>
	   Since servers must be faithful to this specification even on a persistent TCP connection, it 
	   means that (following the initial exchange of timeouts) a server may not be presented with
	   the opportunity to signal a change in the idle timeout associated with a connection if the
	   client does not send any further requests containing EDNS0 OPT RRs. This limitation makes 
	   persistent connection handling via an initial idle timeout signal more attractive than a 
	   mechanism that establishes default persistence and then uses a connection close signal (in 
	   a similar manner to HTTP 1.1 <xref target="RFC7230"/>). </t>

	   <t>If a client includes the edns-tcp-keepalive option in the first 
        query, it SHOULD include an EDNS0 OPT RR periodically
        in any further messages it sends during the TCP session.
        This will increase the chance of the client being notified should
        the server modify the timeout associated with a session. The
	    algorithm for choosing when to do this is out of scope of this document and
	    is left up to the implementor and/or operator.</t>

	<t>DNS clients and servers MAY close a TCP session at any
	  time in order to manage local resource constraints.  The
	  algorithm by which clients and servers rank active TCP
	  sessions in order to determine which to close is not
	  specified in this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Non-clean Paths">
	<t>Many paths between DNS clients and servers suffer from
	  poor hygiene, limiting the free flow of DNS messages that
	  include particular EDNS0 options or messages that exceed
	  a particular size. A fallback strategy similar to that
	  described in <xref target="RFC6891"/>, Section 6.2.2 SHOULD
	  be employed to avoid persistent interference due to
	  non-clean paths.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Anycast Considerations">
	<t>DNS servers of various types are commonly deployed using
	  anycast <xref target="RFC4786"/>.</t>

	<t>Changes in network topology between clients and anycast
	  servers may cause disruption to TCP sessions making use
	  of edns-tcp-keepalive more often than with TCP sessions
	  that omit it, since the TCP sessions are expected to be
	  longer lived. It might be possible for anycast servers to
	  avoid disruption due to topology changes by making use of
	  TCP multipath <xref target="RFC6824"/> to anchor the server
	  side of the TCP connection to an unambiguously unicast address.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

	<section title="Intermediary Considerations">
	<t>It is RECOMMENDED that DNS intermediaries that terminate TCP connections
		implement edns-tcp-keepalive. An intermediary that does not implement
		edns-tcp-keepalive but sits between a client and server that both support
		edns-tcp-keepalive might close idle connections unnecessarily.</t>
	</section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The edns-tcp-keepalive option can potentially be abused
	to request large numbers of long-lived sessions in a quick burst.  When
	a DNS server detects abusive behaviour, it SHOULD immediately
	close the TCP connection and free the resources used.</t>

    <t>Servers could choose to monitor client behaviour with respect to the
        edns-tcp-keepalive option to build up profiles of clients that do not honour
        the specified timeout.</t>

        considerations outlined in <xref target="RFC7766"/></t>
