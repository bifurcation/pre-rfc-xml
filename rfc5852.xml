    <abstract>

	<t>
   In a transport network scenario, Data Plane connections 
   controlled by either a Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (GMPLS) Control Plane (Soft Permanent Connections - SPC) or a
   Management System (Permanent Connections - PC) may independently
   coexist. The ability of transforming an existing PC into an SPC and
   vice versa -- without actually affecting Data Plane traffic being
   carried over it -- is a requirement.  The requirements for the
   conversion between permanent connections and switched connections in
   a GMPLS Network are defined in RFC 5493.
    </t><t>
    This memo describes an extension to GMPLS Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling that
    enables the transfer of connection ownership between the Management
    and the Control Planes. Such a transfer is referred to as a
    Handover. This document defines all Handover-related procedures.
    This includes the handling of failure conditions and subsequent
    reversion to original state. A basic premise of the extension is
    that the Handover procedures must never impact an already
    established Data Plane connection.

<section title="Introduction">
	<t>
	In a typical traditional transport network scenario, Data Plane (DP) 
	connections between two endpoints are controlled by means 
	of a Network Management	System (NMS) operating within the Management
	Plane (MP). NMS/MP is the owner of such transport connections, 
	being responsible for their setup, teardown, and maintenance. 
	</t><t>
	The adoption of a Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) <xref target="RFC3945"/>
	Control Plane (CP) in a network that is already in 
	service -- controlled by the NMS at the MP level -- introduces the 
	need for a procedure able to coordinate a controlled Handover of a Data
	Plane connection from the MP to the CP. 
	</t><t>
	In addition, the control Handover in the opposite direction, from CP to MP
	should be possible as well. The procedures described in this memo can be applied
    to a Label Switched Path (LSP) in any DP switching technology and any network architecture.
	</t> <t>
    This memo describes an extension to GMPLS 
	Resource reSerVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) <xref target="RFC3471"/>
	<xref target="RFC3473"/> signaling that
	enables the Handover of connection ownership between
    the Management and the Control Planes. All Handover-related
    procedures are defined below. This includes the handling of
    failure conditions and subsequent reversion to original state. A
    basic premise of the extension is that the Handover procedures must 
	never impact the exchange of user data on LSPs that are
	already established in the DP.

	We would like to dedicate this work to our friend and colleague Dino
	Bramanti, who passed away at the early age of 38. Dino has been

<section title="Motivation">
	<t>
	The main motivation behind this work is the definition of a simple and 
	very low-impact procedure that satisfies the requirements defined in 
	<xref target="RFC5493"/>. Such a procedure is aimed at 
	giving the transport network operators the chance to
	hand over the ownership of existing LSPs 
	provisioned by NMS from the MP to the CP
	without disrupting user traffic flowing on them.
	Handover from the MP to the CP (i.e., when existing DP connection ownership
	and control is passed from the MP to the CP) has been defined as a mandatory requirement,
	while the opposite operation, CP-to-MP Handover, has been considered as a 
	nice-to-have feature that can be seen as an emergency procedure to disable
	the CP and take manual control of the LSP.
	For more details on requirements and
	motivations, please refer to <xref target="RFC5493"/>.

<section title="Procedures" anchor="sec-proc">
<t>
   The modification defined in this document refers only to the
   ADMIN_STATUS Object, that is, the message flow is left
   unmodified for both LSP setup and deletion.  Moreover, a new Error Value
   is defined to identify the failure of a Handover procedure.
   </t>
<t>
   The following paragraphs give detailed description of the "MP-to-CP
   Handover" and "CP-to-MP Handover" procedures, based on the use of a newly
   defined bit called "H bit".
   </t><t>
   Just as when setting up an LSP using the CP <xref target="RFC3473"/>, the Path
   message may contain full information about the explicit route
   including the links and labels traversed by the LSP. This information
   is encoded in the Explicit Route Object (ERO), and must be supplied
   by the MP using details recorded when the LSP was provisioned, or
   collected by the MP by inspecting the nodes along the path.
   </t><t>
   Alternatively, and also just as when setting up an LSP using the CP
   <xref target="RFC3473"/>, the ERO may include less information such that the details
   of the next hop have to be determined by each node along the LSP as
   it processes the Path message. This approach may be desirable when
   the full information is not available to the MP or cannot be passed
   to the head-end node when initiating the Handover from the MP to the CP.
   </t><t>
   This section (<xref target="sec-proc"/>) describes the general procedures and
   protocol extensions for MP-to-CP Handover, and it uses the case of a
   fully detailed ERO to describe the mechanism. <xref target="sec-altern"/> describes
   how each node behaves in the case of a limited amount of information
   in the ERO.
   </t><t>
   Note that when Handover is being performed for a bidirectional LSP
   and the ERO contains full information including labels, the ERO
   SHOULD include both upstream and downstream labels. Per Section 5.1.1
   of <xref target="RFC3473"/>, the labels are indicated on an output basis; this means
   that the labels are used by the upstream node to create the LABEL_SET
   Object and, for bidirectional LSPs, the UPSTREAM_LABEL Object used in
   the outgoing Path message.
   </t>

<section title="MP-to-CP Handover: LSP Ownership Transfer from Management
         Plane to Control Plane" anchor="sec-hand">

   <t>
   The MP-to-CP Handover procedure MUST create an RSVP-TE session along the  
   path of the LSP to be moved from the MP to the CP, associating it with 
   the existing cross-connected resources owned by the MP 
   (e.g., lambdas, time slots, or reserved bandwidth) and at
   the same time transferring their ownership to the CP.

		</t><t>
		The operator instructs the ingress node to hand over control of the LSP
		from the MP to the CP. In this Handover mode, it supplies the exact
		path of the LSP including any resource reservation and label
		information.
		</t><t>
		The ingress MUST check that no corresponding Path state exists and that
		corresponding Data Plane state does exist. If there is an error, this
		MUST be reported to the operator and further protocol action MUST NOT be
		taken.
		</t><t>
		The ingress signals the LSP using a Path message with the H bit and R
		bit set in the ADMIN_STATUS Object. In this mode of Handover, the Path
		message also carries an ERO that includes Label subobjects indicating
		the labels used by the LSP at each hop. The ingress MUST start the
		Expiration timer (see Section 4.2.1.2 for expiration of this timer).
		Such a timer SHOULD be configurable per LSP and have a default value
		of 30 seconds.
		</t><t>
		Each Label Switching Router (LSR) that receives a Path message with the H bit set checks to see
		whether there is any matching Path state.
		</t><t>
		<list style="symbols">
		<t>If matching Path state is found with the H bit set, this is a Path
		refresh and should be treated accordingly <xref target="RFC3473"/>.</t>
		<t>If matching Path state is found with the H bit clear, this is an
		error and MUST be treated according to the error case description in
		Section 4.2.1.1.</t>
		<t>If no Path state is found, the LSR goes on to check whether there is
		any matching Data Plane state.</t>
		<t>If no matching Data Plane state is found (including only partially
		matching Data Plane state), this is an error or a race condition. It
		MUST be handled according to the description in
		Section 4.2.1.1.</t>
		<t>If matching Data Plane state is found, the LSR MUST save the Path
		state (including the set H bit), and it MUST forward the Path message
		to the egress. The LSR MUST retain any MP state associated with the
		LSP at this point.</t>
		</list>
		</t><t>
		An egress LSR MUST act as any other LSR, except that there is no
		downstream node to which to forward the Path message. If all checks are
		passed, the egress MUST respond with a Resv with the H bit set.
		</t><t>
		A transit LSR MUST process each Resv according to the normal rules of
		<xref target="RFC3473"/>.
		</t><t>
		When an ingress LSR receives a Resv message carrying the H bit set, it
		checks the Expiration timer.
		</t><list style="symbols">
<t>
		If the timer is not running, the Resv is treated as a refresh and no

		If the timer is running, the ingress MUST cancel the timer and SHOULD
		notify the operator that the first stage of Handover is complete. The
		ingress MUST send a Path message that is no different from the
		previous message except that the H bit MUST be clear.
		</t></list><t>
		The Path message with the H bit clear will travel the length of the LSP
		and will result in the return of a Resv with the H bit clear according
		to normal processing <xref target="RFC3473"/>. As a result, the H bit will be cleared
		in the stored Path state at each transit LSR and at the egress LSR. Each
		LSR SHOULD release any associated MP state associated with the LSP when
		it receives the Path message with H bit clear, but MAY retain the information
		according to local policy for use in future MP processing.
		</t><t>
		When the ingress receives a Resv with the H bit clear, the Handover is
		completed. The ingress SHOULD notify the operator that the Handover is
		correctly completed.

	In the case of MP-to-CP Handover, two different failure
	scenarios can happen: Path Failure and Resv Failure. Moreover, each failure can
	be due to two different causes: DP Failure or Communication Failure.
	In any case, the LSP ownership MUST be immediately rolled back to the one previous to the

   If an error occurs, the node detecting the error MUST respond to the
   received Path message with a PathErr message, and MUST abort the
   Handover procedure. The PathErr message SHOULD have the
   Path_State_Removed flag set <xref target="RFC3473"/>, but implementations MAY retain
   their local state and wait for Path state timeout as per normal RSVP
   processing.
   </t><t>
   Nodes receiving a PathErr message MUST follow standard PathErr
   message processing and the associated DP resources MUST NOT be
   impacted. If the local CP state indicates that a Handover is in
   progress (based on the H bit in the Path message), the LSR MUST revert
   the LSP ownership to the MP.

	When a Resv message cannot reach one or more of the upstream nodes,

	In the first scenario we consider the utilization of a reliable
	message delivery based on the mechanism defined in <xref target="RFC2961"/>. 
	After a correct forwarding of the Path message along the
	nodes of the LSP, the Egress LSR sends a Resv message in the opposite 
	direction. It might happen that the Resv message does not
	reach the ingress Label Edge Router (LER) or an LSR, say LSR A.&nbsp; 
	LSR B MUST send a Resv message again for a configurable
	number of times and then, if the delivery does not succeed, the adoption
    procedure will be aborted (via the Expiration timer).

	Considering that the Resv message did not manage to reach LSR A, it is highly probable
    that the PathErr would fail too. Due to this fact, the Expiration timer is used 
	on the ingress LER after sending the path and on LSR A after forwarding it. When the 
	timer expires, if no Resv or PathErr message is received, the Handover procedure 
	is aborted as described in <xref target="sec-sub1"/> and the LSP ownership is
	returned to the Management Plane.

	<!-- Potremmo avvisare l'ingress con un notify-->

	<xref target="fig-f"/>, on the other hand, shows the scenario in which no reliable

   In this case, the Restart Time (see <xref target="RFC3473"/>) indicates that the restart of the

   The sequence is quite similar to the previous one.
   In this sequence, the restart timer will not expire in LSR B since it is run
   infinitely. Instead, after LSR A restarts, LSR B MUST start the recovery timer.
   The recovery timer will expire since there will be no Path message with the
   RECOVERY LABEL received from LSR A given the ingress node had already removed
   the local Path state after it aborts the Handover process. Thus, LSR B MUST tear down
   the specific LSP that is being used to convert the MP resources to CP by
   generating a PathTear message downstream and PathErr message upstream. Similarly to the 
   previous case, both LSR B and the egress LER MUST NOT release the DP
   resources because the H bit is set in the local Path state.

   restarted and could have sent a Path message with a RECOVERY LABEL
   object. LSR B may attempt to resume the Handover process or may abort
   the Handover. This choice is made according to local policy.
	</t><t>
   If resuming the Handover, LSR B MUST treat the received Path message
   as a retransmission, and MUST retransmit its Resv. If aborting
   Handover, LSR B MUST return a PathErr and MUST send a PathTear
   downstream. In both cases, LSR B MUST NOT modify the DP state.

<section title="CP-to-MP Handover: LSP Ownership Transfer from Control Plane
         to Management Plane" anchor="sec-cpmp">
	<t>
	 Let's now consider the case of LSP ownership transfer from Control
	 Plane to Management Plane. Also in this section, we will analyze
	 the Handover procedure success and failure.

   </t><t>
   The scenario is still a DP connection between two nodes
   acting as ingress and egress for a LSP, but in this  
   case, the CP has the ownership and control of the LSP. 
   The CP-to-MP Handover procedure MUST delete the existing RSVP-TE
   session information and MUST NOT affect the cross-connected resources, but
   just move their ownership to the MP.
   </t><t>
   In other words, after LSP ownership transfer from CP to MP, the LSP
   is no longer under the control of RSVP-TE, which is no more able to "see"
   the LSP itself. The CP-to-MP Handover procedure MUST be a standard
   LSP deletion procedure as described in Section 7.2.1 of <xref target="RFC3473"/>.
   The procedure is initiated at the ingress node of the LSP by an MP 
   entity. The ingress node and MP exchange the relevant information for this
   task and then propagate it over CP by means of RSVP-TE tear down signaling
   as described below.
   </t><t>
   The ingress node MUST send a Path message in the downstream direction
   with Handover and Reflect bits set in the ADMIN_STATUS Object. 
   No action is taken over the DP and transit LSRs must forward such message
   towards the egress node. All of the nodes MUST
   keep track of the procedure storing the H bit in their local Path and Resv
   states. Then, every node waits for the H bit to be received within
   the related Resv message.
   After the Resv message is received by the ingress LER, it MUST send a
   PathTear message in order to clear the whole LSP information recorded
   on the RSVP-TE data structures of the nodes.   
   Downstream nodes processing a PathTear message that follows a Path
   message with the H bit set, MUST NOT remove any associated Data 
   Plane state. In other words, a normal LSP tear down signaling is exchanged
   between nodes traversed by the LSP, but the H bit set in the 
   Path message indicates that no DP action has to correspond 
   to CP signaling.
 </t>
</section>

<!--4.4--><section title="CP-to-MP Handover Procedure Failure" anchor="sec-cpmp2">
	<t>
  Failures during CP-to-MP Handover procedure MUST NOT result in the
  removal of any associated Data Plane state.  To that end, when a Resv
  message containing an ADMIN_STATUS Object with the H bit not
  received during the period of time described in Section 7.2.2. of
  <xref target="RFC3473"/> different processing is required. While the H bit is set in
  the Path state, a node MUST NOT send a PathTear when a failure is
  detected.  Instead, the failure is reported upstream using a PathErr.
  The only node that can send a PathTear is the ingress node, and it
  can only do this as a step in the procedures specified in this
  document. This applies to both MP-to-CP and CP-to-MP Handover. The
  ingress node MAY choose to report the failure in the CP-to-MP
  Handover procedure via the MP.
	</t><t>
	The CP-to-MP Handover procedure can also fail due to two causes: PathTear lost or node down.
	In the former case, if the LSP is not under MP control after the Expiration timer elapses,
	a manual intervention from the network operator is requested, while in the latter case, different
	scenarios may happen:

<section title="Minimum Information for MP-to-CP Handover" anchor="sec-altern">
	<t>
   As described in <xref target="sec-proc"/>, it is also possible 
   for the ERO to contain
   less than the full set of path information for the LSP being handed
   over. This arises when only a minimal set of information is handed
   to the CP by the MP at the LSP's head-end. Instead of collecting all
   of the LSP information (including the labels) and formatting it into
   an ERO, as described in <xref target="sec-proc"/>, it is possible to start with a
   minimum amount of information. The full ERO method and the partial/no
   ERO method are not mutually exclusive; support of both methods is
   required.
	</t><t>
	At the ingress node, the information needed
    to specify the LSP is the outgoing interface ID, upstream label, and
    downstream label of this interface and egress node ID. The 
    remaining information about an existing LSP can then
	be collected hop by hop, as the signaling is going on, by looking up
	the cross-connection table in the DP at each node along the LSP
	path.	
	</t><t>
	Starting from the information available at the ingress LER about the
	outgoing interface ID of that ingress node, the incoming interface ID
	of the next hop can be found by looking up the link resource
	table/database in the LER itself. 
	</t><t> 
	The Path message is hence built with the LABEL_SET Object 
	(<xref target="RFC3473"/>) and the UPSTREAM_LABEL Object (<xref target="RFC3473"/>),
    where the upstream label and downstream label of ingress outgoing interface of
	the LSP are included in these two objects. In addition to the above
	mentioned objects, the Path message MUST include the ADMIN_STATUS
	Object with the H bit set, as already defined in previous
	chapters for the detailed ERO-based way of proceeding. Such a Handover
	Path is sent to the incoming interface of the next hop. When this Path
	message reaches the second node along the LSP, the information
	about incoming interface ID and the upstream and downstream labels of
	this interface is extracted from it, and it is used to find next hop
	outgoing interface ID and the upstream/downstream labels by looking
	up the DP cross-connection table.
	</t><t> 
	After having determined, in this way, the parameters describing the 
	LSPs next hop, the outgoing Path message to be sent is built 
	replacing the LABEL_SET Object and UPSTREAM_LABEL Object content 
	with the looked-up values of upstream and downstream labels. 
	</t><t>
	By repeating this procedure for each transit node along the LSP,
	it is possible to make the Handover Path message reach the egress node,
	exactly following the LSP that is in place over DP. The 
	ERO MAY, in this case, be included in the Path message as an optional 
	object, and MAY be filled with the LSP-relevant information down to 
	either the port level with the interface ID or the label level with upstream
	and downstream labels. The ERO can be used to check the consistency 
	of resource in the DP down to the port level or label level at 
	each intermediate node along the LSP.
	</t><t>
	Where the DP path continues beyond the egress, by 
   indicating the Egress label at the head-end of an LSP, the 
   traffic can be directed to the right destination. The GMPLS 
   signaling procedure for egress control is described in <xref target="RFC4003"/>

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sec-security">
<t>
The procedures described in this document rely completely on RSVP-TE
   messages and mechanism. The use of the H bit being set in the ADMIN_STATUS
   Object basically informs the receiving entity that no operations are
   to be done over the DP as a consequence of such special signaling
   flow. Using specially flagged signaling messages, we want to limit the
   function of setup and teardown messages to the CP, making
   them ineffective over related DP resource usage.
   </t><t>
    However, the Handover
	procedures allow the Control Plane to be used to take an LSP out of the
	control of the Management Plane. This could cause considerable
	disruption and could introduce a new security concern. As a consequence, 
	the use of GMPLS security techniques is more important. For RSVP-TE security,
    please refer to <xref target="RFC3473"/>, for the GMPLS security

<abstract><t>This document provides a security framework for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Networks. This document addresses the security aspects that are relevant in the context of MPLS and GMPLS. It describes the security threats, the related defensive techniques, and the mechanisms for detection and reporting. This document emphasizes RSVP-TE and LDP security considerations, as well as Inter-AS and Inter-provider security considerations for building and maintaining MPLS and GMPLS networks across different domains or different Service Providers.</t></abstract>
