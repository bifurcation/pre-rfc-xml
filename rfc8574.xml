            <t> A web resource is routinely referenced by means of the URI
            with which it is directly accessed.  But cases exist where

            <t>A web resource is routinely referenced (e.g., linked or
            bookmarked) by means of the URI with which it is directly
            accessed. But cases exist where referencing a resource by means of
            a different URI is preferred, for example, because the latter URI
            is intended to be more persistent over time. Currently, there is
            no link relation type to convey such an alternative referencing
            preference; this specification addresses this deficit by
            introducing a link relation type intended for that purpose.</t>

        <section title="Terminology" anchor="terminology">

        <t>
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
    described in BCP&nbsp;14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> 
    when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
        </t>


            <t>This specification uses the terms "link context" and "link
            target" as defined in <xref target="RFC8288"/>.  These terms
             correspond with "Context IRI" and "Target IRI", respectively, as
            used in <xref target="RFC5988"/>.  Although defined as
	    IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifiers), they
	    are also URIs in
            common scenarios.</t>
            <t>Additionally, this specification uses the following terms:</t>
            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>&quot;access URI&quot;: A URI at which a user agent accesses a web resource. 
                </t>
                <t>&quot;reference URI&quot;: A URI, other than the access URI,  
                    that should preferentially be used for referencing.
                </t>
            </list></t> 
            <t>By interacting with the access URI, the user agent may discover typed links. 
                For such links, the access URI is the link context.</t>

        <section title="Scenarios" anchor="scenarios">
            <section title="Persistent Identifiers" anchor="PIDs">
            <t>Despite sound advice regarding the design of Cool URIs <xref
            target="CoolURIs"/>, link rot (&quot;HTTP 404 Not Found&quot;) is
            a common phenomena when following links on the Web.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain
            communities of practice (see examples below) have introduced
            solutions to combat this problem. These solutions typically consist of:</t>
            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>Accepting the reality that the web location of a resource -- the access URI -- 
                    may change over time.</t>
                <t>Minting an additional URI for the resource -- the reference URI -- that is specifically 
                    intended to remain persistent over time.</t>
                <t>Redirecting (typically with &quot;HTTP 301 Moved Permanently&quot;, &quot;HTTP 302 Found&quot;, 
                    or &quot;HTTP 303 See Other&quot;) from the reference URI to the access URI.</t>
                <t>Committing, as a community of practice, to adjust that
		redirection whenever the access URI changes 
                    over time.</t>
            </list></t>
            <t>This approach is, for example, used by:</t>
            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>Scholarly publishers that use DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) <xref target="DOIs"/> to identify articles and DOI URLs 
                    <xref target="DOI-URLs"/> as a means to keep cross-publisher article-to-article links 
                    operational, even when the journals in which the articles are published change hands from 
                    one publisher to another, for example, as a result of an acquisition.</t>
                <t>Authors of controlled vocabularies that use PURLs (Persistent Uniform Resource Locators) <xref target="PURLs"/> for vocabulary 
                    terms to ensure that the URIs they assign to vocabulary terms remain stable even if management of the vocabulary is 
                    transferred to a new custodian.</t>
                <t>A variety of organizations (including libraries, archives,
		and museums) that assign ARK (Archival Resource Key) URLs 
                    <xref target="ARK"/> to information objects in order to support long-term 
                    access.</t>
            </list></t>
                <t>In order for the investments in infrastructure involved in these approaches to pay off, 
                and hence for links to effectively remain operational as intended, it is crucial that a resource 
                be referenced by means of its reference URI. However, the access URI is where 
                a user agent actually accesses the resource (e.g., it is the URI in the browser's address bar). 
                As such, there is a considerable risk that the access URI instead of the reference URI 
                is used for referencing <xref target="PIDs-must-be-used"/>.</t>
                <t>The link relation type defined in this document makes it possible for user agents to differentiate the reference URI from the access URI.

            <section title="Version Identifiers" anchor="versions">
                <t>Resource versioning systems often use a naming approach whereby:</t>
                <t><list style="symbols">
                    <t>The most 
                    recent version of a resource is always available at the 
                    same, generic URI.</t>
                    <t>Each version of the resource --  
                    including the most recent one --  
                    has a distinct version URI.</t> 
                </list></t>
                    <t>For example, Wikipedia uses 
                    generic URIs of the form 
                    &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doe&gt;
                    and version URIs of the form 
                    &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Doe&amp;oldid=776253882&gt;.
                </t>
                <t>While the current version of a resource is accessed at 
                the generic URI, some versioning systems adhere to a policy that favors linking and referencing 
                a specific version URI. 
                To express this using the terminology of <xref target="terminology"/>, 
                these policies intend that the generic URI is the access URI
                and that the version URI is the reference URI.
                These policies are informed by the 
                understanding that the content at the generic URI is likely to 
                evolve over time and that accurate links or references should lead to
                the content as it was at the time of referencing. 
                To that end, Wikipedia's &quot;Permanent link&quot; and 
                &quot;Cite this page&quot; functionalities promote the 
                version URI, not the generic URI.
                </t>
                <t>The link relation type defined in this document makes it possible for user agents to differentiate the version URI from the generic URI.</t>

            <section title="Preferred Social Identifier" anchor="ORCID">
                <t>A web user commonly has multiple profiles on the Web, for example,

                    Each of these profiles is accessible at a distinct URI. But the user may 
                    have a preference for one of those profiles, for example, because it is most complete, 
                    kept up to date, or expected to be long lived. As an example, the first author of this document 
                    has, among others, the following profile URIs:
                </t>

                <t>Of these, from the perspective of the person described by these profiles, 
                    the first URI may be the preferred profile URI for the purpose of referencing 
                    because the domain is not under the custodianship of a third party. When an agent accesses 
                    another profile URI, such as 
                    &lt;https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0715-6126&gt;, this preference for referencing by means of the 
                    first URI could be expressed.
                </t>
                <t>The link relation type defined in this specification makes it possible for user agents to differentiate the preferred profile URI from the accessed profile URI.

                <t>When publishing on the Web, it is not uncommon to make distinct components of a

        <section title="The &quot;cite-as&quot; Link Relation Type for Expressing a Preferred URI for the Purpose of Referencing" anchor="identifier-link-relation">
            <t>A link with the "cite-as" relation type indicates that, for referencing the link context, use of the URI 
                of the link target is preferred over use of the URI of the link context. 
                It allows the resource identified by the access URI (link context) 
                to unambiguously link to its corresponding reference URI (link target), 
                thereby expressing that the link target is preferred over the link
                context for the purpose of permanent citation.</t>
            <t>The link target of a "cite-as" link SHOULD support protocol-based access as a means to ensure 
                that applications that store them can effectively reuse them for access.</t>
            <t>The link target of a "cite-as" link SHOULD provide the ability for a user agent to follow its 
                nose back to the context of the link, e.g., by following redirects and/or links. 
                This helps a user agent to establish trust in the target URI. 
                </t>
            <t>Because a link with the "cite-as" relation type expresses a preferred URI for the purpose of 
                referencing, the access URI SHOULD only provide one link with that relation type. 
               If more than one "cite-as" link is provided, the user agent may decide to select one
                (e.g., an HTTP URI over a mailto URI) based on the purpose that the reference URI will serve.</t> 
            <t>Providing a link with the "cite-as" relation type does not
            prevent using the access URI for the purpose of referencing if
            such specificity is needed for the application at hand.  For
            example, in the case of the scenario in <xref target="ORE"/>, the
            access URI is likely required for the purpose of annotating a
            specific component of an intellectual publication. Yet, the
            annotation application may also want to appropriately include the
            reference URI in the annotation.
            </t>
            <t>Applications can leverage the information provided by a "cite-as" link in a variety of ways, for example:</t>
                <t><list style="symbols">
                    <t>Bookmarking tools and citation managers can take this preference into account when recording a URI.</t>
                    <t>Webometrics applications that trace URIs can trace both the access URI and the reference URI.</t>
                    <t>Discovery tools can support lookup by means of both the access and the reference URI. 
                        This includes web archives that typically make archived versions of web resources discoverable by means of 
                        the original access URI of the archived resource; they can additionally make these archived resources discoverable 
                        by means of the associated reference URI.</t>

            <t>Some existing IANA-registered relationships  
                 intuitively resemble the relationship that "cite-as" is intended to convey. 
                But a closer inspection of these candidates provided in the blog posts <xref target="identifier-blog"/>,  
                <xref target="canonical-blog"/>, and <xref target="bookmark-blog"/> shows 
                that they are not appropriate for various reasons and that a new link relation type is required. 
                The remainder of this section provides a summary of the detailed 
                explanations provided in the referenced blog posts.</t>
            <t>It can readily be seen that the following link relation types do not
            address the requirements described in <xref

            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>"alternate" <xref target="RFC4287"/>: The link target
                provides an alternate version of the content at the link
                context. These are typically variants according to dimensions
                that are subject to content negotiation, for example, the same
                content with varying Content-Type (e.g., application/pdf
                vs. text/html) and/or Content-Language (e.g., en vs. fr).  The
                representations provided by the context URIs and target URIs
                in the scenarios in Sections <xref target="PIDs"
		format="counter"/> through <xref
                target="ORE" format="counter"/> are not variants in the sense intended by <xref
                target="RFC4287"/>, and, as such, the use of "alternate" is
                not appropriate.</t>

                <t>"duplicate" <xref target="RFC6249"/>: The link target is a
                resource whose available representations are byte-for-byte
                identical with the corresponding representations of the link

                    <xref target="ORE" format="counter"/> do the link context and the link
                target provide identical content.  As such, the use of

                link target provides a URI for the purpose of bookmarking the
                link context.</t> <t>The intent of "bookmark" is closest to
                that of "cite-as" in that the link target is intended to be a
                permalink for the link context, for bookmarking purposes. The
                link relation type dates back to the earliest days of news
                syndication, before blogs and news feeds had permalinks to
                identify individual resources that were aggregated into a
                single page.  As such, its intent is to provide permalinks for
                different sections of an HTML document.  It was originally
                used with HTML elements such as &lt;div&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;,
                &lt;h2&gt;, etc.; more recently, HTML5 revised it to be
                exclusively used with the &lt;article&gt; element.  Moreover,
                it is explicitly excluded from use in the &lt;link&gt; element
                in HTML &lt;head&gt; and, as a consequence, in the HTTP Link
                header that is semantically equivalent. For these technical
                and semantic reasons, the use of "bookmark" to convey the
                relationship intended by "cite-as" is not appropriate.</t>

            <section title="The &quot;canonical&quot; Link Relation Type" anchor="canonical">
                <t>"canonical" <xref target="RFC6596"/>: 
                    The meaning of "canonical" is commonly misunderstood on the basis of its brief 
                    definition as being "the preferred version of a resource." The description in the abstract of 
                    <xref target="RFC6596"/> is more helpful and states that 
                    "canonical" is intended to link to a resource that is preferred over 
                    resources with duplicative content. 

                    A more detailed reading of 
                    <xref target="RFC6596"/> clarifies that the
                    intended meaning is that "canonical" is preferred for the purpose of
                    content indexing. A typical use case is  
                    linking from each page in a multi-page magazine article to a single page version of the article provided
                    for indexing by search engines: the former pages provide content that is duplicative 
                    to the superset content that is available at the latter page.
                </t>
                <t>The semantics intended by "canonical" as preferred for the purpose of content indexing 
                    differ from the semantics intended by "cite-as" as preferred for the purpose of referencing. 
                    A further exploration of the various scenarios shows that the use of "canonical" is not appropriate 
                    to convey the semantics intended by "cite-as":</t>
                <t><list style="symbols">
                    <t>Scenario of <xref target="PIDs"/>: The reference URI
                    that is intended to be persistent over time does not serve
                    content that needs to be indexed; it merely redirects to
                    the access URI. Since the meaning
                    intended by "canonical" is that it is preferred for the purpose of content
                    indexing, it is
                    not appropriate to point at the reference URI (persistent
                    identifier) using the "canonical" link relation type. Moreover,
                    <xref target="link-identifier-1"/> shows that scholarly
                    publishers that assign persistent identifiers already use
                    the "canonical" link relation type for search engine
                    optimization; it also
                    shows how that use contrasts with the intended use of
                    "cite-as".
                    </t>
                    <t>Scenario of <xref target="versions"/>: In most common
                    cases, custodians of resource versioning systems want
                    search engines to index the most recent version of a page
                    and hence would use a "canonical" link to point from
                    version URIs of a resource to the associated generic
                    URI. Wikipedia effectively does this. However, for some
                    resource versioning systems, including Wikipedia, version
		    URIs are preferred for the
                    purpose of referencing. As
                    such, a "cite-as" link would point from the generic URI to
                    the most recent version URI (that is, in the opposite
                    direction of the "canonical" link).</t>
                    <t>Scenario of <xref target="ORCID"/>: The content at the link target and the link context are different 
                        profiles for a same person. Each profile, not just a preferred one, should be indexed. 
                    But a single one could be preferred for referencing.</t>
                    <t>Scenario of <xref target="ORE"/>: The content at the link target, if any, would typically be a 
                        landing page that includes descriptive metadata pertaining to the multi-resource publication and 
                        links to its component resources. Each component resource 
                        provides content that is different, not duplicative, to the landing page.</t>

                 <t>PLOS ONE is one of many scholarly publishers that assigns DOIs to the articles 
                     it publishes. For example, 
                     &lt;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0171057&gt; is the persistent 
                     identifier for such an article. Via the DOI resolver,

               used with malicious intent to supply misleading URIs for referencing. 
               Use of these links might direct user agents to an attacker's site, 
               break the referencing record they are intended to support, 
               or corrupt algorithmic interpretation of referencing data.</t>
