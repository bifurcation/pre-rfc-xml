    <abstract>

      <t>The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used in networks of all types and
      sizes for time synchronization of servers, workstations, and other
      networked equipment. As time synchronization is more and more a mission-critical service, standardized means for monitoring and management of
      this subsystem of a networked host are required to allow operators of
      such a service to set up a monitoring system that is platform- and
      vendor-independent. This document provides a standardized collection of
      data objects for monitoring the NTP entity of such a network participant
      and it is part of the NTP version 4 standardization effort.</t>

      <t>The NTPv4 MIB module is designed to allow Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to be used to monitor

      entities. It provides a collection of data objects
      that can be queried using the SNMP protocol and represent the current
      status of the NTP entity. This includes general information about the
      NTP entity itself (vendor, product, version) as well as connectivity to
      upstream NTP servers used as sources of reference time and to hardware
      reference clocks like radio clocks. The most important values are
      included in order to be able to detect failures before they can have an
      impact on the overall time synchronization status of the network. There
      are also a collection of notification objects to inform about state
      changes in the NTP entity. There are objects to control these
      notifications as well.</t>

      <t>Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
      the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally
      accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Objects
      in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of
      Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB module that is
      compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, <xref
      target="RFC2578">RFC 2578</xref>, STD 58, <xref target="RFC2579">RFC 2579</xref>
      and STD 58, <xref target="RFC2580">RFC 2580</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Technical Description" toc="include">
      <t>The NTPv4 MIB module is divided into sections for general server
      information, current NTP entity status, status information of all
      mobilized associations (e.g., unicast upstream time servers, multicast or
      broadcast, time references, and hardware clocks), NTP entity control
      objects, NTP objects used only for notifications, as well as SNMP
      notification definitions for core events.</t>

      <t>The general server information section contains static information
      and can be queried to identify which NTP implementation is running on a
      host. This includes the vendor and product name of the running NTP
      software as well as version information, hardware/os platform identity,
      and the time resolution of the underlying OS.</t>

      <t>Section 2 (current NTP status) includes data objects that represent
      the current operational status of the NTP entity.</t>

      <t>The third section contains data objects that represent the set of
      time references ("associations") with which the NTP entity is currently working.</t>

      <t>The fourth section contains objects that can be used to control the
      NTP entity. The currently defined objects control how often the
      heartbeat interval notification is sent out and which notifications are
      enabled.</t>

      <t>The fifth section contains objects that are only used as varbinds in
      notifications. There is currently only one object in this section -- a
      message that adds a cleartext event message to notifications.</t>

      <t>Certain important events can occur while the NTP entity is running.
      The notification section defines SNMP notifications for a collection of
      the most important ones ("core events") and additionally provides a
      heartbeat notification as well as a test notification to allow
      management systems to test the reception of NTP-related notifications as
      well as enable heartbeat-based monitoring systems to assure that the NTP
      entity is still up and running.</t>

      <t>Some values are included both in numeric and in human-readable
      (string) format. This has been done to simplify the representation of a
      status information. If the two representations of a certain value
      differ, the numeric representation takes precedence.</t>

      generated automatically. If it is set to 0, then one single hearbeat
      notification will be created and no further automatically generated
      notification is sent. This functionality can be used to create
      notifications at a higher rate (as high as the object can be
      written).</t>

      <t>ntpEntNotifBits enables/disables notifications. Could be used to
      switch off notifications in order to delay or eliminate the notification
      for critical and important events.</t>

      <t>Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
      MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
      vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control
      even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
      encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network
      via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t>ntpEntSoftwareName, ntpEntSoftwareVersion,
      ntpEntSoftwareVendor, and ntpEntSystemType all can be used to identify
      software and its version as well as the operating system and hardware
      platform. This might help a potential attacker to find security problems
      and therefore can be used in the preparation of an attack.</t>

      <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
      if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then,
      there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
      and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module.
      It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
      provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <xref
      target="RFC3410">RFC 3410</xref>, section 8), including full support for
      the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
      Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
      Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic
      security. It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that
      the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is
      properly configured to give access to the objects only to those
      principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
      (change/create/delete) them.</t>

<abstract><t>The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is widely used to synchronize computer clocks in the Internet.  This document describes NTP Version 4 (NTPv4), which is backwards compatible with NTP Version 3 (NTPv3) described in RFC 1305, as well as previous versions of the protocol. NTPv4 includes a modified protocol header to accommodate the Internet Protocol Version 6 address family.  NTPv4 includes fundamental improvements in the mitigation and discipline algorithms which extend the potential accuracy to the tens of microseconds with modern workstations and fast LANs.  It includes a dynamic server discovery scheme, so that in many cases specific server configuration is not required.  It corrects certain errors in the NTPv3 design and implementation and includes an optional extension mechanism.</t></abstract>
