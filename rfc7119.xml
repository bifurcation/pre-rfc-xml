    <abstract>

      <t>This document specifies the operation of the IP Flow Information
      Export (IPFIX) protocol specific to IPFIX Mediators, including Template
      and Observation Point management, timing considerations, and other
      Mediator-specific concerns.</t>

    </abstract>

<section title="Introduction">

  <t>The IPFIX architectural components in <xref target="RFC5470"/> consist of
  IPFIX Devices and IPFIX Collectors communicating using the IPFIX protocol
  <xref target="RFC7011"/>, which specifies how to
  export IP Flow information. This protocol is designed to export information
  about IP traffic Flows and related measurement data, where a Flow is defined
  by a set of key attributes (e.g., source and destination IP address, source
  and destination port, etc.).</t>

  <t>However, thanks to its Template mechanism, the IPFIX protocol can export
  any type of information, as long as the relevant Information Element is
  specified in the IPFIX Information Model <xref target="RFC7012"/>, registered
  with IANA, or specified as an enterprise-specific Information Element. The
  IPFIX protocol <xref target="RFC7011"/> was not originally written with IPFIX
  Mediators in mind. Therefore, the IPFIX protocol must be adapted for
  Intermediate Processes, as defined in the IPFIX Mediation Reference Model as
  specified in Figure A of <xref target="RFC6183"/>, which is based on the
  IPFIX Mediation Problem Statement <xref target="RFC5982"/>.</t>

  <t>This document specifies the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) protocol in
  the context of the implementation and deployment of IPFIX Mediators. The use
  of the IPFIX protocol within an IPFIX Mediator -- a device that contains
  both a Collecting Process and an Exporting Process -- has an impact on the
  technical details of the usage of the protocol. An overview of the technical
  problem is covered in Section 6 of <xref target="RFC5982"/>: loss of original Exporter information, loss of base
time information, transport sessions management, loss of Options
Template Information, Template Id management, considerations for
network topology, IPFIX mediation interpretation, and considerations for aggregation.</t>
  <t>The specifications in this document are based on the IPFIX protocol
  specifications <xref target="RFC7011"/>, but they are 
  adapted according to the IPFIX Mediation Framework <xref
  target="RFC6183"/>.</t>

  <section title="IPFIX Documents Overview">
  
    <t>The IPFIX protocol <xref target="RFC7011"/>
    provides network administrators with access to IP Flow information.</t>

    <t>The architecture for the export of measured IP Flow information out of
    an IPFIX Exporting Process to a Collecting Process is defined in the IPFIX
    Architecture <xref target="RFC5470"/>, per the requirements defined in the
    IPFIX Requirements document, <xref target="RFC3917"/>.</t>

    <t>The IPFIX Architecture <xref target="RFC5470"/> specifies how IPFIX
    Data Records and Templates are carried via a congestion-aware transport
    protocol from IPFIX Exporting Processes to IPFIX Collecting Processes.</t>

    <t>IPFIX has a formal description of IPFIX Information Elements, their
    names, types, and additional semantic information, as specified in the IPFIX
    Information Model <xref
    target="RFC7012"/>. 
    The <xref target="IANA-IPFIX">IPFIX Information Element
    registry</xref> is maintained by IANA. New
    Information Element definitions can be added to this registry subject
    to an Expert Review <xref target="RFC5226" />, with additional process considerations
    described in <xref target="RFC7013"/>; that document also provides
    guidelines for authors and reviewers of new Information Element
    definitions. The inline export of the Information Element type 
    information is specified in <xref target="RFC5610"/>.</t>

    <t>The IPFIX Applicability Statement <xref target="RFC5472"/> describes
    what type of applications can use the IPFIX protocol and how they can use
    the information provided. It furthermore shows how the IPFIX framework
    relates to other architectures and frameworks.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="IPFIX Mediator Documents Overview">

    <t>"IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Mediation: Problem Statement" <xref target="RFC5982"/>
    provides an overview of the applicability of IPFIX Mediators and defines
    requirements for IPFIX Mediators in general terms. This document is of use
    largely to define the problems to be solved through the deployment of
    IPFIX Mediators and to provide scope to the role of IPFIX Mediators within an
    IPFIX collection infrastructure.</t>

    <t>"IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Mediation: Framework"
    <xref target="RFC6183"/>, which details the IPFIX Mediation
    reference model and the components of an IPFIX Mediator, provides
    more architectural details of the arrangement of Intermediate
    Processes within an IPFIX Mediator.</t>

    <t>Documents specifying the operations of specific
    Intermediate Processes cover the operation of these Processes within the
    IPFIX Mediator framework and comply with the specifications given in this
    document; additionally, they may specify the operation of the process
    independently, outside the context of an IPFIX Mediator, when this is
    appropriate. The details of specific Intermediate Processes, when they 
    have additional export specifications (e.g., metadata about the 
    intermediate processing conveyed through IPFIX Options Templates), are 
    each addressed in their own document. As of today, these documents are:</t>

     <t><list style="numbers">

      <t>"IP Flow Anonymization Support", <xref target="RFC6235"/>, which describes
      anonymization techniques for IP flow data and the export of anonymized
      data using the IPFIX protocol.</t>

      <t>"Flow Selection Techniques" <xref
      target="RFC7014"/>, which describes the
      process of selecting a subset of Flows from all Flows observed at an
      Observation Point, the flow selection motivations, and some specific
      flow selection techniques.</t>

      <t>"Flow Aggregation for the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Protocol"
      <xref target="RFC7015"/>, which describes Aggregated Flow
      export within the framework of IPFIX Mediators and defines an
      interoperable, implementation-independent method for Aggregated Flow
      export.</t>

    </list></t>   

    <t>This document specifies the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) protocol
    specific to Mediation, to which all Intermediate Processes must comply.
    Some extra specifications might be required per Intermediate Process type
    (in which case, the document specific to the Intermediate Process would apply).</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Relationship with the IPFIX and PSAMP Protocols">

    <t>The specification in this document is based on the IPFIX protocol
    specification <xref target="RFC7011"/>. All specifications from <xref
    target="RFC7011"/> apply unless specified otherwise in this document.</t>

    <t>As the Packet Sampling (PSAMP) protocol specifications <xref target="RFC5476"/> are
    based on the IPFIX protocol specifications, the specifications in this
    document are also valid for the PSAMP protocol. Therefore, the method
    specified by this document also applies to PSAMP.</t>

  </section>

</section>

<section title="Terminology">

  <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

  <t>IPFIX-specific terms, such as Observation Domain, Flow, Flow Key,
  Metering Process, Exporting Process, Exporter, IPFIX Device, Collecting
  Process, Collector, Template, IPFIX Message, Message Header, Template
  Record, Data Record, Options Template Record, Set, Data Set, Information
  Element, Scope and Transport Session, used in this document are defined in <xref
  target="RFC7011"/>. The PSAMP-specific terms used
  in this document, such as Filtering and Sampling, are defined in <xref
  target="RFC5476"/>.</t>

  <t>IPFIX Mediation terms related to aggregation, such as the Interval,
  Aggregated Flow and Aggregated Function, are defined in <xref
  target="RFC7015"/>.</t>

  <t>The terminology specific to IPFIX Mediation that is used in this document is defined
  in "IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Mediation: Problem Statement" <xref target="RFC5982"/> and reused
  in "IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Mediation: Framework" <xref target="RFC6183"/>. However, since
  both of those documents are Informational RFCs, the definitions have been
  reproduced and elaborated on here.</t>

  <t>Similarly, since <xref target="RFC6235"/> is an Experimental RFC, the
  Anonymization Record, Anonymized Data Record, and Intermediate Anonymization
  Process terms, specified in <xref target="RFC6235"/>, are also reproduced
  here.</t>

  <t>In this document, as in <xref
  target="RFC7011"/>, <xref target="RFC5476"/>,
  <xref target="RFC7015"/>, and <xref target="RFC6235"/>, the first
  letter of each IPFIX-specific and PSAMP-specific term is capitalized along
  with the IPFIX Mediation-specific term defined here.</t>

  <t>In this document, we call a stream of records carrying flow- or packet-based information a "record stream". The records may be encoded as IPFIX Data Records or any other format.</t>

  <t><list style="hanging">

    <t hangText="Transport Session: ">The Transport Session is
    specified in <xref target="RFC7011"/>. In Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP),
    the Transport Session information is the SCTP association. In TCP and UDP,
    the Transport Session information corresponds to a 5-tuple {Exporter IP
    address, Collector IP address, Exporter transport port, Collector transport
    port, transport protocol}.</t>

    <t hangText="Original Exporter: ">An Original Exporter is the source from
    which a Mediator receives its record stream. For simple IPFIX mediation
    without protocol conversion, this is an IPFIX Device that hosts the
    Observation Points where the metered IP packets are observed.</t>

    <t hangText="Original Observation Point: ">An Observation Point on a
    Metering Process associated with the Original Exporter. In the case of the
    Intermediate Aggregation Process on an IPFIX Mediator, the Original
    Observation Point can be composed of, but not limited to, a (set of)
    specific Exporter(s), a (set of) specific interface(s) on an Exporter, a
    (set of) line card(s) on an Exporter, or any combinations of these.</t>

    <t hangText="IPFIX Mediation: ">IPFIX Mediation is the manipulation and
    conversion of a record stream for subsequent export using the IPFIX
    protocol.</t>

    <t hangText="Template Mapping: ">A mapping from Template Records and/or
    Options Template Records received by an IPFIX Mediator to Template Records and/or
    Options Template Records sent by that IPFIX Mediator. Each entry in a
    Template Mapping is scoped by incoming or outgoing Transport Session and
    Observation Domain, as with Templates and Options Templates in the IPFIX
    Protocol.</t>

    <t hangText="Anonymization Record: ">A record that defines the properties
    of the anonymization applied to a single Information Element within a
    single Template or Options Template, as in <xref target="RFC6235"/>.</t>

    <t hangText="Anonymized Data Record: ">A Data Record within a Data Set
    containing at least one Information Element with anonymized values. The
    Information Element(s) within the Template or Options Template describing
    this Data Record SHOULD have a corresponding Anonymization Record, as in
    <xref target="RFC6235"/>.</t>

  </list></t>

  <t>The following terms are used in this document to describe the
  architectural entities used by IPFIX Mediation.</t>

  <t><list style="hanging">

    <t hangText="Intermediate Process: ">An Intermediate Process takes a
    record stream as its input from Collecting Processes, Metering Processes,
    IPFIX File Readers, other Intermediate Processes, or other record sources;
    performs some transformations on this stream, based upon the content of
    each record, states maintained across multiple records, or other data
    sources; and passes the transformed record stream as its output to
    Exporting Processes, IPFIX File Writers, or other Intermediate Processes,
    in order to perform IPFIX Mediation. Typically, an Intermediate Process is
    hosted by an IPFIX Mediator. Alternatively, an Intermediate Process may be
    hosted by an Original Exporter.</t>

    <t hangText="IPFIX Mediator: ">An IPFIX Mediator is an IPFIX Device that
    provides IPFIX Mediation by receiving a record stream from some data
    sources, hosting one or more Intermediate Processes to transform that
    stream, and exporting the transformed record stream into IPFIX Messages
    via an Exporting Process. In the common case, an IPFIX Mediator receives a
    record stream from a Collecting Process, but it could also receive a
    record stream from data sources not encoded using IPFIX, e.g., in the case
    of conversion from the NetFlow V9 protocol <xref target="RFC3954"/> to
    IPFIX protocol.</t>

  </list></t>

  <t>Specific Intermediate Processes are described below.</t>

  <t><list style="hanging">

    <t hangText="Intermediate Conversion Process"> (as in <xref
    target="RFC6183"/>): An Intermediate Conversion Process is an Intermediate
    Process that transforms non-IPFIX into IPFIX or manages the relation among
    Templates and states of incoming/outgoing Transport Sessions in the case of
    transport protocol conversion (e.g., from UDP to SCTP).</t>

    <t hangText="Intermediate Aggregation Process"> (as in <xref
    target="RFC7015"/>): an Intermediate Process (IAP), as in
    <xref target="RFC6183" />, that aggregates records, based upon a set of Flow Keys or
    functions applied to fields from the record.</t>

    <t hangText="Intermediate Correlation Process"> (as in <xref
    target="RFC6183"/>): An Intermediate Correlation Process is an Intermediate
    Process that adds information to records, noting correlations among them,
    or generates new records with correlated data from multiple records (e.g.,
    the production of bidirectional flow records from unidirectional flow
    records).</t>

    <t hangText="Intermediate Anonymization Process"> (as in <xref
    target="RFC6235"/>): An intermediate process that takes Data Records and
    transforms them into Anonymized Data Records.</t>

    <t hangText="Intermediate Selection Process"> (as in <xref
    target="RFC6183"/>): An Intermediate Selection Process is an Intermediate
    Process that selects records from a sequence based upon criteria-evaluated
    record values and passes only those records that match the criteria (e.g.,
    Filtering only records from a given network to a given Collector).</t>

    <t hangText="Intermediate Flow Selection Process"> (as in <xref
    target="RFC7014"/>: An Intermediate Flow
    Selection Process is an Intermediate Process, as in <xref target="RFC6183" /> that takes
    Flow Records as its input and selects a subset of this set as its output.
    The Intermediate Flow Selection Process is a more general concept than
    the Intermediate Selection Process as defined in <xref target="RFC6183" />. While an
    Intermediate Selection Process selects Flow Records from a sequence based
    upon criteria-evaluated Flow record values and only passes on those Flow
    Records that match the criteria, an Intermediate Flow Selection Process
    selects Flow Records using selection criteria applicable to a larger set of
    Flow characteristics and information.</t>
    <t>Note: for more information on the difference between Intermediate Flow 
    Selection Process and Intermediate Selection Process, see Section 4 in 
    <xref target="RFC7014"/>.</t>

  <t>The header fields as exported by an IPFIX Mediator are described below.</t>

  <t><list style="hanging">

    <t hangText="Version: ">
<vspace blankLines="1" />Version of IPFIX to which this Message conforms. 
     The value of this field is 0x000a for the current version, incrementing 
     by one the version used in the NetFlow services export version 9 <xref target="RFC3954"/>.</t>

    <t hangText="Length: "><vspace blankLines="1" />Total length of the IPFIX Message, measured in

     leaves the IPFIX Mediator, expressed in seconds since the UNIX epoch of 
     1 January 1970 at 00:00 UTC, encoded as an unsigned 32-bit integer. <vspace blankLines="1" />
     However, in the specific case of an IPFIX Mediator
     containing an Intermediate Conversion Process, the IPFIX Mediator MAY
     use the export time received from the incoming Transport Session.</t>

    <t hangText="Sequence Number: "><vspace blankLines="1" />Incremental sequence counter modulo 2^32
    of all IPFIX Data Records sent in the current stream from the current
    Observation Domain by the Exporting Process. Each SCTP Stream counts
    sequence numbers separately, while all messages in a TCP connection or UDP
    Transport Session are considered to be part of the same stream. This value
    can be used by the Collecting Process to identify whether any IPFIX
    Data Records have been missed. Template and Options Template Records do
    not increase the Sequence Number. </t>

    <t hangText="Observation Domain ID: "><vspace blankLines="1" />A 32-bit identifier of the 
    Observation Domain that is locally unique to the Exporting Process.  The 
    Exporting Process uses the Observation Domain ID to uniquely identify to 
    the Collecting Process the Observation Domain that metered the Flows.  It 
    is RECOMMENDED that this identifier also be unique per IPFIX Device. 
    Collecting Processes can use the Transport Session and the
    Observation Domain ID field to separate different export streams 
    originating from the same Exporter.  The Observation Domain ID 
    is set to 0 when no specific Observation Domain ID is relevant for 
    the entire IPFIX Message, for example, when exporting the
    Exporting Process Statistics, or in case of a hierarchy of
    Collectors when aggregated Data Records are exported. 
<vspace blankLines="1" />
See
    <xref target="sec-tmpl-passthrough"/> for special considerations for

    Mediator, and <xref target="sec-oop"/> for guidelines for preservation of
    original Observation Domain information at an IPFIX Mediator.</t>

  </list></t>

  <t>The following specifications, copied over from <xref
  target="RFC7011"/> have some implications in 
  this document: 

<list><t>Template Withdrawals MAY appear interleaved with Template Sets,
  Options Template Sets, and Data Sets within an IPFIX Message. In this
  case, the Templates and Template Withdrawals shall be interpreted as taking effect in the order in which they appear in the IPFIX Message.</t></list></t>

  <t>If an IPFIX Mediator receives an IPFIX Message composed of Template
  Withdrawals and Template Sets, and if the IPFIX Mediator forwards this IPFIX
  Message, it MUST NOT modify the Set order. If an IPFIX Mediator receives 
  IPFIX Messages composed of Template Withdrawals and Template Sets, and if 
  the IPFIX Mediator forwards these IPFIX Messages, it MUST NOT modify the 
  IPFIX Message order. Note that the Template Mapping (see Section 4.1) is 
  the authoritative source of information on the IPFIX Mediator to decide 
  whether the entire IPFIX Messages can be forwarded as such.</t>


</section>

<section title="Template Management">

  <t>How an IPFIX Mediator handles the Templates it receives from the Original
  Exporter depends entirely on the nature of the Intermediate Process running
  on that IPFIX Mediator. There are two cases here:</t> 

  <t><list style="numbers">

    <t>IPFIX Mediators that pass substantially the same Data Records from the
    Original Exporter downstream (e.g., an Intermediate Selection Process),
    pass unmodified Templates as described in <xref
    target="sec-tmpl-passthrough"/>; this section describes a Template Mapping
    required to make this work in the general case, and the correlation between
    the received and generated IPFIX Message Withdrawals.</t>

    <t>IPFIX Mediators that export Data Records that are substantially changed
    from the Data Records received from the Original Exporter follow the
    guidelines in <xref target="sec-tmpl-new"/> instead: in this case, the
    IPFIX Mediator generates new (Options) Template Records as a result of the
    Intermediate Process, and no Template Mapping is required.</t>
  
  </list></t>

  <t>Subsequent subsections deal with specific issues in Template management
  that may occur at IPFIX Mediators.</t>

  <section title="Passing Unmodified Templates through an IPFIX Mediator" anchor="sec-tmpl-passthrough">

    <t>For some Intermediate Processes, the IPFIX Mediator doesn't modify the
    (Options) Template Record(s) content. A typical example is an Intermediate
    Flow Selection Process acting as distributor, which collects Flow Records
    from one or more Exporters, and based on the content of the Information Elements,
    redirects the Flow Records to the appropriate Collector. This example is a
    typical case of a single network operation center managing multiple
    universities: a unique IPFIX Collector collects all Flow Records for the
    common infrastructure, but might be re-exporting specific university Flow
    Records to the responsible system administrator. </t>

    <t>As specified in <xref target="RFC7011"/>,
    the Template IDs are unique per Exporter, per Transport Session, and per
    Observation Domain. As there is no guarantee that, for similar Template
    Records, the Template IDs received on the incoming Transport Session and
    exported to the outgoing Transport Session would be same, the IPFIX
    Mediator MUST maintain a Template Mapping composed of related received and
    exported (Options) Template Records:</t>

    <t><list style="symbols">

      <t>for each received (Options) Template Record: Template Record 
      Information Elements, Template ID, Observation Domain ID, and
      Transport Session information, metadata scoped to the Template (*)</t>

      <t>for each exported (Options) Template Record: Template Record 
      Information Elements, Template ID, Collector, Observation Domain ID,
      and Transport Session information metadata scoped to the Template (*)</t>

    </list></t>

      <t>(*) The "metadata scoped to the Template" encompasses the metadata,
      that are scoped to the Template, and that help to determine the semantics
      of the Template Record. Note that these metadata are typically sent in
      Data Records described by an Options Template. An example is the
      flowKeyIndicator. An IPFIX Mediator could potentially receive two
      different Template IDs, from the same Exporter, with the same Information
      Elements, but with a different set of Flow Keys (indicated by the
      flowKeyIndicator in an Options Template Record). Another example is the
      combination of anonymizationFlags and anonymizationTechnique <xref
      target="RFC6235"/>). This metadata information must be present in the
      Template Mapping, to stress that the two Template Record semantics are
      different. </t>
    
    <t>If an IPFIX Mediator receives an IPFIX Withdrawal Message for a
    (Options) Template Record that is not used anymore in any other Template
    Mappings, the IPFIX Mediator SHOULD export the appropriate IPFIX
    Withdrawal Message(s) on the outgoing Transport Session and remove the
    corresponding entry in the Template Mapping.</t>

    <t>If a (Options) Template Record is not used anymore in an outgoing
    Transport Session, it MUST be withdrawn with an IPFIX Template Withdrawal
    Message on that specific outgoing Transport Session, and its entry, MUST be
    removed from the Template Mapping.</t>

    <t>If an incoming or outgoing Transport Session is gracefully shut down or
    reset, the (Options) Template Records corresponding to that Transport
    Session MUST be removed from the Template Mapping.</t>

    <t>For example, <xref target="fig-selection-example"/> displays an example
    of an Intermediate Flow Selection Process, redistributing Data Records to
    Collectors on the basis of customer networks, i.e., the Route Distinguisher
    (RD). In this example, the Template Record received from the Exporter #1
    is reused towards Collector #1, Collector #2, and Collector #3, for the 
    customer #1, customer #2, and customer #3, respectively. In this 
    example, the outgoing Template Records exported to the different 
    Collectors are identical. As a reminder that the Template ID uniqueness 
    is local to the Transport Session and Observation Domain that generated 
    the Template ID, a mix of Template ID 256 and 257 has been used.</t>

    <t>In the situation where Original Exporters each export an (Options)
    Template Record to a single IPFIX Mediator, and the (Options) Template Record
    contains the same Information Elements, but in different order, should the
    IPFIX Mediator maintain a Template Mapping with a single Export Template
    Record (see <xref target="template-mapping-and-ordering-a-single-export-template-record" />) or should the IPFIX Mediator maintain multiple independent
    Template Records (see <xref target="template-mapping-and-ordering-multiple-template-records" />) before re-exporting to the Collector? </t>

      <t>The answer depends on whether the order of the Information Elements
      implies some specific semantic. One of the guiding principles in IPFIX
      protocol specifications is that the semantic meaning of one
      Information Element doesn't depend on the value of any other
      Information Element. However, there is one noticeable exception, as
      mentioned in <xref target="RFC7011"/>:</t>
   
      <t><list><t>Multiple Scope Fields MAY be present in the Options Template Record,
      in which case the composite scope is the combination of the scopes.
      For example, if the two scopes are meteringProcessId and templateId,
      the combined scope is this Template for this Metering Process. If a
      different order of Scope Fields would result in a Record having a
      different semantic meaning, then the order of Scope Fields MUST be
      preserved by the Exporting Process. For example, in the context of
      PSAMP <xref target="RFC5476"/>, if the first scope defines the filtering function,
      while the second scope defines the sampling function, the order of
      the scope is important. Applying the sampling function first,
      followed by the filtering function, would lead to potentially
      different Data Records than applying the filtering function first,
      followed by the sampling function.</t></list></t>

      <t>If an IPFIX Mediator receives, from multiple Exporters, Template
      Records with identical Information Elements, but ordered differently, it
      SHOULD consider those Template Records as identical, subject to metadata 
      information in the associated Options Template (for example, the Flow Key 
      Options Template, see <xref target="optionstemplate" />).</t>

      <t>If an IPFIX Mediator receives, from multiple Exporters, Options
      Template Records with identical and ordered Information Elements in the
      Scope fields, and with identical Information Elements, but ordered
      differently, in the non-Scope fields, it SHOULD consider those Template
      Records as identical.</t>

      <t>If an IPFIX Mediator receives, from multiple Exporters, Options
      Template Records with identical Information Elements in the Scope field, but
      ones that are ordered differently, it MUST consider those Template Records as
      semantically different.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Creating New Templates at an IPFIX Mediator" anchor="sec-tmpl-new">

    <t>For other Intermediate Processes, the IPFIX Mediator generates new
    (Options) Template Records as a result of the Intermediate Process.</t>

    <t>In these cases, the IPFIX Mediator doesn't need to maintain a Template
    Mapping, as it generates its own series of (Options) Template Records.
    However, some special cases might still require a Template Mapping.
    Consider a situation where the IPFIX Mediator generates new (Options)
    Template Records based on what it receives from the Exporter(s) based on
    the Intermediate Process function: for example, an Intermediate Anonymization
    process that performs black-marker anonymization <xref target="RFC6235"/>
    on certain Information Elements. In such cases, it's important to keep the
    correlation between the received (Options) Template Records and derived
    (Options) Template Records in the Template Mapping. These Template Mappings
    would be kept as in <xref target="sec-tmpl-passthrough"/>, except that the
    exported Template would not be identical to the received Template.</t>
    
    <t>Similar to Exporting Processes in any Exporter, an IPFIX Mediator may
    use the technique for reducing redundancy in IPFIX described in <xref
    target="RFC5473"/>.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Handling Unknown Information Elements">

      <t>Depending on application requirements, Mediators that do not generate
      new Records SHOULD re-export values for unknown Information Elements, for
      which the Mediator does not have information about Information Element
      data type and semantics. However, as there may be presence or ordering
      dependencies among the unknown Information Elements, the Mediator MUST
      NOT omit fields from such re-exported Records or reorder any fields
      within the Records.</t>
      
      <t>Mediators that generate new Records, as in <xref
      target="sec-tmpl-new"/>, MUST ignore values of Information Elements they
      do not understand. If a Mediator passes values of Information Elements it
      does not understand (for example, when re-exporting Flow Records), it MUST
      pass them in the order in which they were originally received.</t>


      
      <t>In any case, Mediators handling unknown Information Elements SHOULD
      log this fact, as it is likely that mediation of records containing
      unknown values will have unintended consequences.</t>
      
  </section>

</section>

<section title="Preserving Original Observation Point Information" anchor="sec-oop">

  <t>Depending on the use case, the Collector in an Exporter/IPFIX Mediator/Collector structure (for example, tiered Mediators) may need to receive
  information about the Original Observation Point(s); otherwise, it may wrongly
  conclude that the IPFIX Device exporting the Flow Records, i.e., the IPFIX
  Mediator, directly observed the packets that generated the Flow Records. Two
  new Information Elements are introduced to address this use case:
  originalExporterIPv4Address and originalExporterIPv6Address. Practically, the
  Original Exporters will not be exporting these Information Elements.
  Therefore, the Intermediate Process will report the Original Observation
  Point(s) to the best of its knowledge. Note that the Configuration Data Model
  for IPFIX and PSAMP <xref target="RFC6728"/> may report the Original Exporter
  information out of band.</t>

  <t>In the IPFIX Mediator, the Observation Point(s) may be represented
  by:</t>

  <t><list style="symbols">

    <t>A single Original Exporter (represented by the
    originalExporterIPv4Address or originalExporterIPv6Address Information
    Elements).</t>

    <t>A list of Original Exporters (represented by a list of
    originalExporterIPv4Address or originalExporterIPv6Address Information
    Elements).</t>

    <t>Any combination or list of Information Elements representing
    Observation Points. For example:

    <list style="symbols">

      <t>A list of Original Exporter interfaces (represented by the
      originalExporterIPv4Address or originalExporterIPv6Address, the
      ingressInterface, and/or egressInterface Information Elements,
      respectively).</t>

      <t>A list of Original Exporter line card (represented by the
      originalExporterIPv4Address, originalExporterIPv6Address, or 
      lineCardId Information Elements, respectively).</t>

    </list></t>

  </list></t>

  <t>Some Information Elements characterizing the Observation Point may be
  added. For example, the flowDirection Information Element specifies the
  direction of the observation, and, as such, characterizes the Observation
  Point.</t>

  <t>Any combination of the above representations is possible. An example
  of an Original Observation Point for an Intermediate Aggregation Process 
  is displayed in Figure 8.</t>

  <figure title="Complex Observation Point Definition Example" anchor="fig-oop-example">
    <artwork><![CDATA[

  interface serial 2, direction egress
exporterIPv4Address 192.0.2.3, 
  lineCardId 1, direction ingress
]]></artwork>
  </figure>

  <t>A Mediator MAY export such complex Original Observation Point information,
  depending on application requirements. If such information is exported, the
  Mediator MUST use <xref target="RFC6313"/> to do so, as described below.</t>

  <t>The most generic way to export the Original Observation Point is to use a
  subTemplateMultiList, with the semantic "exactlyOneOf". Taking the previous
  example, the encoding in Figure 9 can be used.</t>

  <figure title="Complex Observation Point Definition Example: Templates" anchor="fig-oop-templates-example">
     <artwork><![CDATA[
Template Record 257: exporterIPv4Address
Template Record 258: exporterIPv4Address, 
                     basicList of ingressInterface, flowDirection
Template Record 259: exporterIPv4Address, lineCardId, flowDirection
]]></artwork>
  </figure>

  <t>The Original Observation Point is modeled with the Data Records
  corresponding to either Template Record 1, Template Record 2, or Template
  Record 3 but not more than one of these ("exactlyOneOf" semantic). This
  implies that the Flow was observed at exactly one of the Observation Points
  reported.</t>

  <t>When an IPFIX Mediator receives Flow Records containing the Original
  Observation Point Information Element, i.e., originalExporterIPv4Address or 
  originalExporterIPv6Address, the IPFIX Mediator SHOULD NOT modify its
  value(s) when composing new Flow Records in the general case. Known
  exceptions include anonymization per Section 7.2.4 of <xref target="RFC6235"/>
  and an Intermediate Correlation Process rewriting addresses across NAT. In
  other words, the Original Observation Point should not be replaced with the
  IPFIX Mediator Observation Point. The daisy chain of (Exporter, Observation
  Point) representing the path the Flow Records took from the Exporter to the
  top Collector in the Exporter/IPFIX Mediator(s)/Collector structure model
  is out of the scope of this specification.</t>
  
  <t>The following subsections describe Information Elements for reporting
  Original Exporter addresses as seen by the Collecting Process; note they may

<section title="Managing Observation Domain IDs">

  <t>The Observation Domain ID of any IPFIX Message containing
  Flow Records relevant to no particular Observation Domain, or to multiple
  Observation Domains, MUST have an Observation Domain ID of 0.</t>

  <t>IPFIX Mediators that do not change (Options) Template Records MUST
  maintain a Template Mapping, as detailed in <xref
  target="sec-tmpl-passthrough"/>, to ensure that the combination of
  Observation Domain IDs and Template IDs do not collide on export.</t>

  <t>For IPFIX Mediators that export New (Options) Template Records, as in
  <xref target="sec-tmpl-new"/>, there are two options for Observation
  Domain ID management. The first and simplest of these is to completely
  decouple exported Observation Domain IDs from received Observation Domain
  IDs; the IPFIX Mediator, in this case, comprises its own set of
  Observation Domain(s) independent of the Observation Domain(s) of the
  Original Exporters.</t>

  <t>The second option is to provide or maintain a Template Mapping for
  received (Options) Template Records and exported inferred (Options)
  Template Records, along with the appropriate Observation Domain IDs per
  Transport Session, which ensures that the combination of Observation
  Domain IDs and Template IDs do not collide on export.</t>

  <t>In some cases where the IPFIX Message Header can't contain a consistent
  Observation Domain for the entire IPFIX Message, but the Flow Records
  exported from the IPFIX Mediator should contain the Observation
  Domain of the Original Exporter anyway, the (Options) Template Record must
  contain the originalObservationDomainId Information Element, specified in 
  <xref target="ie-ood" />. When an IPFIX Mediator receives Flow Records containing the 
  originalObservationDomainId Information Element, the IPFIX Mediator MUST NOT 
  modify its value(s) when composing new Flow Records with the 
  originalObservationDomainId Information Element.</t>

<section title="Timing Considerations">

    <t>The IPFIX Message Header "Export Time" field is the time in seconds
    since 0000 UTC Jan 1, 1970, at which the IPFIX Message leaves the IPFIX
    Mediator. However, in the specific case of an IPFIX Mediator containing
    an Intermediate Conversion Process, the IPFIX Mediator MAY use the
    export time received from the incoming Transport Session.</t>

    <t>It is RECOMMENDED that IPFIX Mediators handle time using absolute
    timestamps (e.g., flowStartSeconds, flowStartMilliseconds, or
    flowStartNanoseconds), which are specified relative to the UNIX epoch
    (00:00 UTC 1 Jan 1970) <xref target="POSIX.1" />, where possible rather than relative timestamps
    (e.g., flowStartSysUpTime or flowStartDeltaMicroseconds), which are specified
    relative to protocol structures such as system initialization or message
    export time.</t>

    <t>The latter are difficult to manage for two reasons. First, they require
    constant translation, as the system initialization time of an intermediate
    system and the export time of an intermediate message will change across
    mediation operations. Further, relative timestamps introduce range
    problems. For example, when using the flowStartDeltaMicroseconds and
    flowEndDeltaMicroseconds Information Elements <xref
    target="IANA-IPFIX"/>, the Data Record must be exported within
    a maximum of 71 minutes after its creation. Otherwise, the 32-bit counter
    would not be sufficient to contain the flow start time offset. Those time
    constraints might be incompatible with some of the application
    requirements of some Intermediate Processes.</t>

    <t>Intermediate Processes MUST NOT assume that received records appear in
    flowStartTime, flowEndTime, or observationTime order. An Intermediate
    Process processing timing information (e.g., an Intermediate Aggregation
    Process) MAY ignore records that are significantly out of order, in order
    to meet application-specific state and latency requirements, but SHOULD
    report that records were dropped.</t>

    <t>When an Intermediate Process aggregates information from different Flow
    Records, the timestamps on exported records SHOULD be the minimum of the
    start times and the maximum of the end times in the general case. However,
    if the Flow Records do not overlap, i.e., if there is a time gap between the
    times in the Flow Records, then the report may be inaccurate. The IPFIX
    Mediator is only reporting what it knows, on the basis of the information
    made available to it, and there may not have been any data to observe
    during the gap. Then again, if there is an overlap in timestamps, there's
    the potential of double-accounting: different Observation Points may have
    observed the same traffic simultaneously. The specification of the precise
    rules for applying Flow Record timestamps at IPFIX Mediators for all the
    different situations is out of the scope of this document.</t>

    <t>Note that <xref target="RFC7015"/> provides additional
    specifications for handling of timestamps at an Intermediate Aggregation
    Process.</t>

</section>

<section title="Transport Considerations">

  <t>SCTP <xref target="RFC4960"/> using the Partially Reliable SCTP (PR-SCTP) extension specified in
  <xref target="RFC3758"/> MUST be implemented by all compliant IPFIX Mediator
  implementations. TCP <xref target="RFC0793"/> MAY also be implemented by implementations compliant with the
  IPFIX Mediator. UDP <xref target="RFC0768"/> MAY
  also be implemented by compliant IPFIX Mediator implementations.
  Transport-specific considerations for IPFIX Exporters as specified in
  Sections 8.3, 8.4, 9.1, 9.2, and 10 of <xref
  target="RFC7011"/> apply to IPFIX Mediators as
  well.</t>

  <t>SCTP SHOULD be used in deployments where IPFIX Mediators and
  Collectors are communicating over links that are susceptible to congestion.
  SCTP is capable of providing any required degree of reliability. TCP MAY
  be used in deployments where IPFIX Mediators and Collectors communicate over
  links that are susceptible to congestion, but SCTP is preferred due to
  its ability to limit back pressure on Exporters and its message versus
  stream orientation. UDP MAY be used, although it is not a congestion-aware
  protocol. However, in this case, the IPFIX traffic between IPFIX Mediator and
  Collector MUST run in an environment where IPFIX traffic has been
  provisioned for and/or separated from non-IPFIX traffic, whether 
  physically or virtually.</t>

</section>

<section title="Collecting Process Considerations">

  <t>Any Collecting Process compliant with <xref
  target="RFC7011"/> can receive IPFIX Messages from
  an IPFIX Mediator. If the IPFIX Mediator uses <xref target="RFC6313">IPFIX
  Structured Data</xref> to export Original Exporter Information, as in <xref
  target="sec-oop"/>, the Collecting Process MUST support <xref
  target="RFC6313"/>.</t>

</section>

<section title="Specific Reporting Requirements">

    <t>IPFIX provides Options Templates for the reporting the reliability of
    processes within the IPFIX Architecture. As each Mediator includes at least
    one IPFIX Exporting Process, they MAY use the Exporting Process Reliability
    Statistics Options Template, as specified in <xref
    target="RFC7011"/>.</t>

    <t>Analogous to the Metering Process Reliability Statistics Options
    Template, also specified in <xref target="RFC7011"/>, Mediators MAY
    implement the Intermediate Process Reliability Statistics Options Template,
    specified in Sections <xref target="IPR_stats" format="counter"/>, <xref target="ie-ipid" format="counter"/>, and <xref target="ie-irtc"  format="counter"/> define Information
    Elements used by this Options Template.</t>

    <t>The Flow Keys Options Template, as specified in <xref
    target="RFC7011"/>, may require special
    handling at an IPFIX Mediator, as described in <xref target="optionstemplate" />.</t>

    <t>In addition, each Intermediate Process may have its own specific
    reporting requirements (e.g., Anonymization Records as in <xref
    target="RFC6235"/>, or the Aggregation Counter Distribution Options
    Template as in <xref target="RFC7015"/>); these SHOULD be
    implemented as necessary, as described in the specification for each
    Intermediate Process.</t>

        <t>The Intermediate Process Statistics Options Template specifies the

<section title="Operations and Management Considerations">

  <t>In general, using IPFIX Mediators to combine information from multiple
  Original Exporters requires a consistent configuration of the Metering
  Processes behind these Original Exporters. The details of this consistency
  are specific to each Intermediate Process. Consistency of configuration
  should be verified out of band, with the MIB modules (<xref
  target="RFC6615"/> and <xref target="RFC6727"/>) or with the Configuration
  Data Model for IPFIX and PSAMP <xref target="RFC6728"/>.</t>

  <t>From an operational perspective, this specification provides all the
  information required to set up IPFIX Mediators and Collectors behind IPFIX
  Mediators. While configuring the IPFIX Mediators, care must be taken to
  include all the relevant information so that the Collectors deduce the Data
  Records precise semantic. This is covered by the Template Mapping
  specifications in <xref target="sec-tmpl-passthrough"/>. Also, caution
  must be taken that if something is not carefully configured in the processing
  chain, this can lead to the wrong interpretation of collected IPFIX data, and
  the associated applications can produce results that are not operationally
  meaningful.</t>

</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">

  <t>As they act as both IPFIX Collecting Processes and Exporting Processes,
  the Security Considerations for the IPFIX Protocol <xref
  target="RFC7011"/> also apply to IPFIX Mediators. The
  Security Considerations for IPFIX Files <xref target="RFC5655"/> also apply
  to IPFIX Mediators that write IPFIX Files or use them for internal storage.
  However, there are a few specific considerations that IPFIX Mediator
  implementations must also take into account.</t>

  <t>By design, IPFIX Mediators are "men in the middle": they intercede in the
  communication between an Original Exporter (or another upstream IPFIX
  Mediator) and a downstream Collecting Process. This has two important
  implications for the level of confidentiality provided across an IPFIX
  Mediator and the ability to protect data integrity and Original Exporter
  authenticity across an IPFIX Mediator. These are addressed in more detail in
  the Security Considerations for IPFIX Mediators in <xref
  target="RFC6183"/>.</t>

  <t>Note that while IPFIX Mediators can use the exporterCertificate and
  collectorCertificate Information Elements defined in <xref target="RFC5655"/>
  as described in Section 9.3 of <xref target="RFC6183"/> to export information
  about X.509 identities in upstream TLS-protected Transport Sessions, this
  mechanism cannot be used to provide true end-to-end assertions about a chain
  of IPFIX Mediators: any IPFIX Mediator in the chain can simply falsify the
  information about upstream Transport Sessions. In situations where
  information about the chain of mediation is important, it must be determined
  out of band. Note as well that an Exporting Process has no in-band way to
  determine whether or not a given Collecting Process will act as a Mediator.
  Trust placed in Collecting Processes is absolute, so care should be taken
  when exporting IPFIX Messages between Exporting Processes and Collecting
  Processes controlled by different entities.</t>

<section title="IANA Considerations">

  <t>This document specifies new IPFIX Information Elements,
  originalExporterIPv4Address in <xref target="ie-oe4"/>,
  originalExporterIPv6Address in <xref target="ie-oe6"/>, 
  originalObservationDomainId in <xref target="ie-ood"/>, 
  intermediateProcessId in <xref target="ie-ipid"/>, and

<abstract><t>NAT devices are required to log events like creation and deletion of translations and information about the resources it is managing.  The logs are required in many cases to identify an attacker or a host that was used to launch malicious attacks and/or for various other purposes of accounting.  Since there is no standard way of logging this information, different NAT devices behave differently and hence it is difficult to expect a consistent behavior.  The lack of a consistent way makes it difficult to write the collector applications that would receive this data and process it to present useful information.  This document describes the information that is required to be logged by the NAT devices.</t></abstract>
