    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document discusses some existing commonly used BGP mechanisms for
      Autonomous System Number (ASN) migration that are not formally part of
      the <xref target="RFC4271">BGP4</xref> protocol specification. These
      mechanisms are local to a given BGP speaker and do not require
      negotiation with or cooperation of BGP neighbors. The deployment of
      these mechanisms do not need to interwork with one another to accomplish
      the desired results, so slight variations between existing vendor
      implementations exist and will not necessarily be harmonized due to
      this document. However, it is necessary to document these de facto
      standards to ensure that new implementations can be successful, and any
      future protocol enhancements to BGP that propose to read, copy,
      manipulate, or compare the AS_PATH attribute can do so without inhibiting
      the use of these very widely used ASN migration mechanisms.</t>

      <t>The migration mechanisms discussed here are useful to ISPs and
      organizations of all sizes, but it is important to understand the
      business need for these mechanisms and illustrate why they are so
      critical for ISPs' operations. During a merger, acquisition, or
      divestiture involving two organizations it is necessary to seamlessly
      migrate both internal and external BGP speakers from one ASN to a second
      ASN. The overall goal in doing so is to simplify operations through
      consistent configurations across all BGP speakers in the combined
      network. In addition, given that the BGP Path Selection algorithm
      selects routes with the shortest AS_PATH attribute, it is critical that
      the ISP does not increase AS_PATH length during or after ASN migration,
      because an increased AS_PATH length would likely result in sudden,
      undesirable changes in traffic-patterns in the network.</t>

      <t>By default, the BGP protocol requires an operator to configure a
      router to use a single remote ASN for the BGP neighbor, and the ASN must
      match on both ends of the peering in order to successfully negotiate and
      establish a BGP session. Prior to the existence of these migration
      mechanisms, it would have required an ISP to coordinate an ASN change
      with, in some cases, tens of thousands of customers. In particular, as
      each router is migrated to the new ASN, to avoid an outage due to ASN
      mismatch, the ISP would have to force all customers on that router to
      change their router configurations to use the new ASN immediately after
      the ASN change. 

Thus, it was critical to define a more asymmetric migration method so
that the ISP could seamlessly change the ASN within its network(s) but
allow the customers to gradually migrate to the ISP's new ASN when
convenient. These customer migrations could occur either by coordinating
individual session reconfigurations or, to allow for truly asymmetric
migration, by accepting sessions using either the old or new ASN.

    <section title="ASN Migration Scenario Overview">
      <t>The use case being discussed here is an ISP merging two or more ASNs,
      where eventually one ASN subsumes the other(s). In this use case, we
      will assume the most common case where there are two ISPs, A and B, that
      prior to the ASN migration use AS 64500 and 64510, respectively. AS
      64500 will be the permanently retained ASN used across the consolidated
      set of both ISPs network equipment, and AS 64510 will be retired. Thus,
      at the conclusion of the ASN migration, there will be a single ISP A'
      with all internal BGP speakers configured to use AS 64500. To all
      external BGP speakers, the AS_PATH length will not be increased.</t>

      <t>In this same scenario, AS 64496 and AS 64499 represent two separate
      customer networks: C and D, respectively. Originally, customer C (AS
      64496) is attached to ISP B, which will undergo ASN migration from AS
      64510 to AS 64500. Furthermore, customer D (AS 64499) is attached to ISP
      A, which does not undergo ASN migration since the ASN for ISP A will
      remain constant, (AS 64500). Although this example refers to AS 64496
      and 64499 as customer networks, either or both may be settlement-free or
      other types of peers. In this use case, they are referred to as
      "customers" merely for convenience.</t>

      <t>The general order of operations, typically carried out in a single
      maintenance window by the network undergoing ASN migration (ISP B), is
      as follows. First, ISP B will change the global BGP ASN used by a
      Provider Edge (PE) router, from ASN 64510 to 64500. At this point, the
      router will no longer be able to establish External BGP (eBGP) sessions toward the
      existing Customer Edge (CE) devices that are attached to it and still
      using AS 64510. Second, since ISP B needs to do this without
      coordinating the simultaneous change of its ASN with all of its eBGP
      peers, ISP B will configure two separate, but related ASN migration
      mechanisms discussed in this document on all eBGP sessions toward all CE
      devices. These mechanisms enable the router to establish BGP neighbors
      using the legacy ASN, modify the AS_PATH attribute received from a CE
      device when advertising it further, and modify AS_PATH when transmitted
      toward CE devices to achieve the desired effect of not increasing the
      length of the AS_PATH.</t>

      <t>At the conclusion of the ASN migration, the CE devices at the edge of
      the network are not aware of the fact that their upstream router is now
      in a new ASN and do not observe any change in the length of the AS_PATH
      attribute. However, after the changes discussed in this document are put
      in place by ISP A', there is a change to the contents of the AS_PATH
      attribute to ensure the AS_PATH is not artificially lengthened while
      these AS migration parameters are used.</t>

      <t>In this use case, neither ISP is using BGP Confederations <xref
      target="RFC5065" /> internally.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="ebgp-mechanism"
             title="External BGP Autonomous System Migration Mechanisms">
      <t>The following section addresses optional capabilities that are
      specific to modifying the AS_PATH attribute at the Autonomous System
      Border Routers (ASBRs) of an organization (typically a single Service
      Provider). This ensures that external BGP customers/peers are not forced
      to make any configuration changes on their CE routers before or during
      the exact time the Service Provider wishes to migrate to a new,
      permanently retained ASN. Furthermore, these mechanisms eliminate the
      artificial lengthening of the AS_PATH both transmitted from and received
      by the Service Provider that is undergoing AS Migration, which would
      have negative implications on path selection by external networks.</t>

      <section title="Modify Inbound BGP AS_PATH Attribute">
        <t>The first instrument used in the process described above is called
        "Local AS". This allows the router to supersede the globally
        configured ASN in the "My Autonomous System" field of the <xref
        target="RFC4271">BGP OPEN</xref> with a locally defined AS value for a
        specific BGP neighbor or group of neighbors. This mechanism allows the
        PE router that was formerly in ISP B to establish an eBGP session
        toward the existing CE devices using the legacy AS -- AS 64510.
        Ultimately, the CE devices (i.e., customer C) are completely unaware
        that ISP B has reconfigured its router to participate as a member of a
        new AS. Within the context of the former ISP B PE router, the second
        effect this specific mechanism has on AS_PATH is that, by default, it
        prepends all received BGP UPDATEs with the legacy AS of ISP B -- AS
        64510 -- while advertising it (Adj-RIB-Out) to other BGP speakers (A').
        Within the Loc-RIB on ISP B prior to the migration, the AS_PATH of
        route announcements received from customer C would appear as 64496,
        whereas the same RIB on ISP A' (ISP B routers post-migration) would
        contain AS_PATH 64510 64496.</t>

        <t>The second instrument, referred to as "No Prepend Inbound", is
        enabled on PE routers migrating from ISP B. The "No Prepend Inbound"
        capability causes ISP B's routers to not prepend the legacy AS (AS
        64510), when advertising UPDATES received from customer C. This
        restores the AS_PATH within ISP A' for route announcements received
        from customer C so that it is just one ASN in length: 64496.</t>

        <t>In the direction of CE -&gt; PE (inbound):</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>"Local AS": Allows the local BGP router to generate a BGP OPEN
            to an eBGP neighbor with the old, legacy ASN value in the "My
            Autonomous System" field. When this capability is activated, it
            also causes the local router to prepend the &lt;old_ASN&gt; value
            to the AS_PATH when installing or advertising routes received from
            a CE to Internal BGP (iBGP) neighbors inside the Autonomous System.</t>

            <t>"No Prepend Inbound (of Local AS)": The local BGP router does
            not prepend the &lt;old_ASN&gt; value to the AS_PATH when installing
            or advertising routes received from the CE to iBGP neighbors
            inside the Autonomous System</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>PE&nbhy;B is a PE that was originally in ISP B, and has a customer eBGP
        session to CE&nbhy;B. PE&nbhy;B has had its global configuration ASN changed
        from AS 64510 to AS 64500 to make it part of the permanently retained
        ASN. This now makes PE&nbhy;B a member of ISP A'. PE&nbhy;A is a PE that was
        originally in ISP A, and has a customer peer CE&nbhy;A. Although its global
        configuration ASN remains AS 64500, throughout this exercise we also
        consider PE&nbhy;A a member of ISP A'.</t>

        <t>As a result, using both the "Local AS" and "No Prepend Inbound"
        capabilities on PE&nbhy;B, CE&nbhy;A will see an AS_PATH of 64500 64496. CE&nbhy;A
        will not receive a BGP UPDATE containing AS 64510 in the AS_PATH. (If
        only the "Local AS" mechanism was configured without "No Prepend
        Inbound" on PE&nbhy;B, then CE&nbhy;A would have seen an AS_PATH of 64500 64510
        64496, which results in an unacceptable lengthening of the AS_PATH).
        Note: If there are still routers in the old ASN (64510), it is
        possible for them to accept these manipulated routes (i.e., those with
        64510 removed from the AS_PATH by this command) as if they have not
        already passed through their ASN, potentially causing a loop, since
        BGP's normal loop-prevention behavior of rejecting routes that include
        its ASN in the path will not catch these. Careful filtering between
        routers remaining in the old ASN and routers migrated to the new ASN
        is necessary to minimize the risk of routing loops.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Modify Outbound BGP AS_PATH Attribute">
        <t>The two aforementioned mechanisms, "Local AS" and "No Prepend
        Inbound", only modify the AS_PATH attribute received by the ISP's PEs
        in the course of processing BGP UPDATEs from CE devices when CE
        devices still have an eBGP session established with the ISPs legacy AS
        (AS64510).</t>


        <t>In some existing implementations, "Local AS" and "No Prepend
        Inbound" do not concurrently modify the AS_PATH attribute for BGP
        UPDATEs that are transmitted by the ISP's PEs to CE devices. In these
        implementations, with "Local AS" and "No Prepend Inbound" used on
        PE&nbhy;B, there is an automatic lengthening of the AS_PATH in outbound
        BGP UPDATEs from ISP A' toward directly attached eBGP speakers
        (customer C in AS 64496). The externally observed result is that
        customer C in AS 64496 will receive the following AS_PATH: 64510
        64500 64499. Therefore, if ISP A' takes no further action, there will
        be an unacceptable increase in the AS_PATH length within the customer's
        networks directly attached to ISP A'.</t>

        <t>A tertiary mechanism, referred to as "Replace Old AS", is used to
        resolve this problem. This capability allows ISP A' to prevent routers
        from appending the globally configured ASN in outbound BGP UPDATEs
        toward directly attached eBGP neighbors that are using the "Local AS"
        mechanism. Instead, only the old (or previously used) AS will be
        prepended in the outbound BGP UPDATE toward the customer's network,
        restoring the AS_PATH length to what it what was before AS Migration
        occurred.</t>

        <t>To reuse the above diagram, but in the opposite direction, we
        have:</t>

        </figure>

        <t>By default, without the use of "Replace Old AS", CE&nbhy;B would see an
        AS_PATH of 64510 64500 64499. After ISP A' changes PE&nbhy;B to use
        "Replace Old AS", CE&nbhy;B would receive an AS_PATH of 64510 64499, which
        is the same AS_PATH length pre-AS migration.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Implementation">
        <t>The mechanisms introduced in this section MUST be configurable on a
        per-neighbor or per-neighbor-group basis to allow for maximum
	flexibility. (Here, "neighbor group" refers to a group of similar 
   BGP neighbor statements that reuse some common configuration to 
   simplify provisioning.) When the "Local
        AS" capability is used, a local ASN will be provided in the
        configuration that is different from the globally configured ASN of
        the BGP router. To implement this mechanism, a BGP speaker SHOULD send
        <xref target="RFC4271">BGP OPEN</xref> (see Section 4.2) messages to
        the configured eBGP peer(s) using the local ASN configured for this
        session as the value sent in "My Autonomous System". The BGP router
        SHOULD NOT use the ASN configured globally within the BGP process as
        the value sent in "My Autonomous System" in the OPEN message. This
        prevents causing the eBGP neighbor to unnecessarily generate a BGP
        OPEN Error message "Bad Peer AS". This method is typically used to
        re-establish eBGP sessions with peers expecting the legacy ASN after a
        router has been moved to a new ASN.</t>

        <t>Implementations MAY support a more flexible model where the eBGP
        speaker attempts to open the BGP session using either the ASN
        configured as "Local AS" or the globally configured AS as discussed in
        <xref target="Alias">BGP Alias</xref>. If the session is successfully
        established to the globally configured ASN, then the modifications to
        AS_PATH described in this document SHOULD NOT be performed, as they
        are unnecessary. The benefit to this more flexible model is that it
        allows the remote neighbor to reconfigure to the new ASN without
        direct coordination between the ISP and the customer.</t>

        <t>Note that this procedure will vary slightly if the locally or
        globally configured ASN is a 4-octet ASN. See Section 3 of <xref
        target="RFC6793"/>.</t>


        <t>When the BGP router receives UPDATEs from its eBGP neighbor
        configured with the "Local AS" mechanism, it processes the UPDATE as
        described in <xref target="RFC4271">RFC4271 Section 5.1.2</xref>.
        However, the presence of a second ASN due to "Local AS" adds the
        following behavior to processing UPDATEs received from an eBGP
        neighbor configured with this mechanism:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Internal: The router SHOULD append the configured "Local AS"
            ASN in the AS_PATH attribute before installing the route or
            advertising the UPDATE to an iBGP neighbor. The decision of when
            to append the ASN is an implementation detail outside the scope of
            this document. Some considerations factoring into this decision
            include consistency in the AS_PATH throughout the AS, and

            <t>"No Prepend Inbound": When the BGP router receives
            inbound BGP UPDATEs from its eBGP neighbor configured with this
            option, it MUST NOT append the "Local AS" ASN value in the AS_PATH
            attribute when installing the route or advertising that UPDATE to
            iBGP neighbors, but it MUST still append the globally configured
            ASN as normal when advertising the UPDATE to other local eBGP
            neighbors (i.e., those natively peering with the globally
            configured ASN).</t>

            <t>"Replace Old AS" (outbound): When the BGP router
            generates outbound BGP UPDATEs toward an eBGP neighbor configured
            with this option, the BGP speaker MUST NOT append the globally
            configured ASN from the AS_PATH attribute. The BGP router MUST
            append only the configured "Local AS" ASN value to the AS_PATH
            attribute before sending the BGP UPDATEs outbound to the eBGP
            neighbor.</t>

             title="Internal BGP Autonomous System Migration Mechanisms">
      <t>The following section describes mechanisms that assist with a gradual
      and least service-impacting migration of Internal BGP sessions from a
      legacy ASN to the permanently retained ASN. The following mechanism is
      very valuable to networks undergoing AS migration, but its use does not
      cause changes to the AS_PATH attribute.</t>

      <section title="Internal BGP AS Migration">
        <t>In this case, all of the routers to be consolidated into a single,
        permanently retained ASN are under the administrative control of a
        single entity. Unfortunately, the traditional method of migrating all
        Internal BGP speakers, particularly within larger networks, is both
        time-consuming and widely service impacting.</t>

        <t>The traditional method to migrate Internal BGP sessions was
        strictly limited to reconfiguration of the global configuration ASN
        and, concurrently, changing all iBGP neighbors' remote ASN from the
        legacy ASN to the new, permanently retained ASN on each router within
        the legacy AS. These changes can be challenging to swiftly execute in
        networks with more than a few dozen internal BGP routers. There
        are also the concomitant service interruptions as these changes are
        made to routers within the network, resulting in a reset of iBGP
        sessions and subsequent route reconvergence to reestablish optimal
        routing paths. Operators often cannot make such sweeping changes given
        the associated risks of a highly visible service interruption; rather,
        they require a more gradual method to migrate Internal BGP sessions,
        from one ASN to a second, permanently retained ASN, that is not
        visibly service impacting to its customers.</t>

        <t>With the "Internal BGP AS Migration" mechanism described herein, it
        allows an Internal BGP speaker to form a single iBGP session using
        either the old, legacy ASN or the new, permanently retained ASN. The
        benefits of using this mechanism are several fold. First, it allows
        for a more gradual and less service-impacting migration away from the
        legacy ASN to the permanently retained ASN. Second, it (temporarily)
        permits the coexistence of the legacy and permanently retained ASN
        within a single network, allowing for uniform BGP path selection among
        all routers within the consolidated network.</t>

        <t>The iBGP router with the "Internal BGP AS Migration" capability
        enabled allows the receipt of a BGP OPEN message with either the
        legacy ASN value or the new, globally configured ASN value in the "My
        Autonomous System" field of the BGP OPEN message from iBGP neighbors.
        It is important to recognize that enablement of the "Internal BGP AS
        Migration" mechanism preserves the semantics of a regular iBGP session
        (i.e., using identical ASNs). Thus, the BGP attributes transmitted by
        and the acceptable methods of operation on BGP attributes received
        from iBGP sessions configured with "Internal BGP AS Migration"
        capability are no different than those exchanged across an iBGP
        session without "Internal BGP AS Migration" configured, as defined by
        <xref target="RFC4271"/> and <xref target="RFC4456"/>.</t>

        <t>Typically, in medium to large networks, <xref target="RFC4456">BGP
        Route Reflectors (RRs)</xref> are used to aid in reduction of
        configuration of iBGP sessions and scalability with respect to overall
        TCP (and BGP) session maintenance between adjacent iBGP routers.
        Furthermore, BGP Route Reflectors are typically deployed in pairs
        within a single Route Reflection cluster to ensure high reliability of
        the BGP Control Plane. As such, the following example will use Route
        Reflectors to aid in understanding the use of the "Internal BGP AS
        Migration" mechanism. Note that Route Reflectors are not a
        prerequisite to enable "Internal BGP AS Migration" and this mechanism
        can be enabled independent of the use of Route Reflectors.</t>

        <t>The general order of operations is as follows:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Within the legacy network, (the routers comprising the set of
            devices that still have a globally configured legacy ASN), one
            member of a redundant pair of RRs has its global configuration ASN
            changed to the permanently retained ASN. Concurrently, the
            "Internal BGP AS Migration" capability is enabled on all iBGP
            sessions on that device. This will comprise Non-Client iBGP
            sessions to other RRs as well as Client iBGP sessions, typically
            to PE devices, both still utilizing the legacy ASN. Note that
            during this step there will be a reset and reconvergence event on
            all iBGP sessions on the RRs whose configuration was modified;
            however, this should not be service impacting due to the use of
            redundant RRs in each RR Cluster.</t>

            <t>The above step is repeated for the other side of the redundant
            pair of RRs. The one alteration to the above procedure is that the
            "Internal BGP AS Migration" mechanism is now removed from the
            Non-Client iBGP sessions toward the other (previously
            reconfigured) RRs, since it is no longer needed. The "Internal BGP
            AS Migration" mechanism is still required on all RRs for all RR
            Client iBGP sessions. Also during this step, there will be a reset
            and reconvergence event on all iBGP sessions whose configuration
            was modified, but this should not be service impacting. At the
            conclusion of this step, all RRs will have their globally
            configured ASN set to the permanently retained ASN and "Internal
            BGP AS Migration" enabled and in use toward RR Clients.</t>

            <t>At this point, the network administrators would then be able to
            establish iBGP sessions between all Route Reflectors in both the
            legacy and permanently retained networks. This would allow the
            network to appear to function, both internally and externally, as
            a single, consolidated network using the permanently retained
            network.</t>

            <t>To complete the AS migration, each RR Client (PE) in the legacy
            network still utilizing the legacy ASN is now modified.
            Specifically, each legacy PE would have its globally configured
            ASN changed to use the permanently retained ASN. The ASN
            configured within the PE for the iBGP sessions toward each RR
            would be changed to use the permanently retained ASN. It is
            unnecessary to enable the "Internal BGP AS Migration" mechanism on
            these migrated iBGP sessions. During the same maintenance window,
            External BGP sessions would be modified to include the above
            "Local AS", "No Prepend", and "Replace Old AS" mechanisms described
            in <xref target="ebgp-mechanism" /> above, since all of the
	    changes are service interrupting to the eBGP sessions of the PE. At this point, all
            PEs will have been migrated to the permanently retained ASN.</t>

            <t>The final step is to excise the "Internal BGP AS Migration"
            configuration from the Router Reflectors in an orderly fashion.
            After this is complete, all routers in the network will be using
            the new, permanently retained ASN for all iBGP sessions with no
            vestiges of the legacy ASN on any iBGP sessions.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The benefit of using the aforementioned "Internal BGP AS Migration"
        capability is that it is a more gradual and less externally
        service impacting change to accomplish an AS migration. Previously,
        without "Internal BGP AS Migration", such an AS migration change would
        carry a high risk and need to be successfully accomplished in a very
        short time frame (e.g., at most several hours). In addition, it would
        likely cause substantial routing churn and rapid fluctuations in
        traffic carried -- potentially causing periods of congestion and
        resultant packet loss -- during the period when the configuration changes
        are underway to complete the AS Migration. On the other hand, with
        "Internal BGP AS Migration", the migration from the legacy ASN to the
        permanently retained ASN can occur over a period of days or weeks with
        reduced customer disruption. (The only observable service disruption
        should be when each PE undergoes the changes discussed in step 4
        above.)</t>

      <section anchor="Alias" title="Implementation">
        <t>The mechanism introduced in this section MUST be configurable on a
        per-neighbor or per-neighbor-group basis to allow for maximum
        flexibility. When configured with this mechanism, a BGP speaker MUST
        accept BGP OPEN and establish an iBGP session from configured iBGP
        peers if the ASN value in "My Autonomous System" is either the
        globally configured ASN or a locally configured ASN provided when this
        capability is utilized. Additionally, a BGP router configured with
        this mechanism MUST send its own <xref target="RFC4271">BGP
        OPEN</xref> (see Section 4.2) using either the globally configured or
        the locally configured ASN in "My Autonomous System" as follows. To
        avoid potential deadlocks when two BGP speakers are attempting to
        establish a BGP peering session and are both configured with this
        mechanism, the speaker SHOULD send BGP OPEN using the globally
        configured ASN first, and only send a BGP OPEN using the locally
        configured ASN as a fallback if the remote neighbor responds with the
        BGP error "Bad Peer AS". In each case, the BGP speaker MUST treat
        UPDATEs sent and received to this peer as if this was a natively
        configured iBGP session, as defined by <xref target="RFC4271"/> and
        <xref target="RFC4456"/>.</t>

        <t>Note that this procedure will vary slightly if the locally or
        globally configured ASN is a 4-octet ASN. See Section 3 of <xref
        target="RFC6793"/>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Additional Operational Considerations">
      <t>This document describes several mechanisms to support ISPs and other
      organizations that need to perform ASN migrations. Other variations of
      these mechanisms may exist, for example, in legacy router software that
      has not been upgraded or reached End of Life, but continues to operate
      in the network. Such variations are beyond the scope of this
      document.</t>

      <t>Companies routinely go through periods of mergers, acquisitions, and
      divestitures, which in the case of the former cause them to accumulate
      several legacy ASNs over time. ISPs often do not have control over the
      configuration of customers' devices (i.e., the ISPs are often not
      providing a managed CE router service, particularly to medium and large
      customers that require eBGP). Furthermore, ISPs are using methods to
      perform ASN migration that do not require coordination with customers.
      Ultimately, this means there is not a finite period of time after which
      legacy ASNs will be completely expunged from the ISP's network. In fact,
      it is common that legacy ASNs and the associated External BGP AS
      Migration mechanisms discussed in this document can and do persist for
      several years, if not longer. Thus, it is prudent to plan that legacy
      ASNs and associated External BGP AS Migration mechanisms will persist in
      an operational network indefinitely.</t>

      <t>With respect to the Internal BGP AS Migration mechanism, all of the
      routers to be consolidated into a single, permanently retained ASN are
      under the administrative control of a single entity. Thus, completing
      the migration from iBGP sessions using the legacy ASN to the permanently
      retained ASN is more straightforward and could be accomplished in a
      matter of days to months. Finally, good operational hygiene would
      dictate that it is good practice to avoid using "Internal BGP AS
      Migration" capability over a long period of time for reasons of not only
      operational simplicity of the network, but also reduced reliance on that
      mechanism during the ongoing life cycle management of software, features,
      and configurations that are maintained on the network.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document discusses a process by which one ASN is migrated into and
      subsumed by another. This involves manipulating the AS_PATH attribute
      with the intent of not increasing the AS_PATH length, which would
      typically cause the BGP route to no longer be selected by BGP's Path
      Selection Algorithm in others' networks. This could result in sudden and
      unexpected shifts in traffic patterns in the network, potentially
      resulting in congestion.</t>

      <t>Given that these mechanisms can only be enabled through configuration
      of routers within a single network, standard security measures should be
      taken to restrict access to the management interface(s) of routers that
      implement these mechanisms. Additionally, BGP sessions SHOULD be
      protected using <xref target="RFC5925">TCP Authentication Option</xref>
