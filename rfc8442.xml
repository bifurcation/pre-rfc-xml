<abstract>

<t>This document defines several new cipher suites for version 1.2 of the Transport
Layer Security (TLS) protocol and version 1.2 of the Datagram Transport Layer
Security (DTLS) protocol. These cipher suites are
based on the Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman with Pre-Shared Key
(ECDHE_PSK) key exchange together with the Authenticated Encryption with
Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms AES-GCM and AES-CCM. PSK provides
light and efficient authentication, ECDHE provides forward secrecy, and
AES-GCM and AES-CCM provide encryption and integrity protection.</t>

<section title="Introduction">

<t>This document defines new cipher suites that provide Pre-Shared Key
(PSK) authentication, Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), and Authenticated
Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD). The cipher suites are defined
for version 1.2 of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
protocol <xref target="RFC5246" /> and version 1.2  of the Datagram
Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol <xref target="RFC6347" />.</t>

<t>PSK authentication is widely used in many scenarios.
One deployment is 3GPP networks where pre-shared keys are used to
authenticate both subscriber and network. Another deployment is
Internet of Things where PSK authentication is often preferred for
performance and energy efficiency reasons. 

In both scenarios, the
endpoints are owned and/or controlled by a party that provisions the pre-shared
keys and makes sure that they provide a high level of entropy.</t>

<t>Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) is a strongly recommended feature in
security protocol design and can be accomplished by using an ephemeral
Diffie-Hellman key exchange method. Ephemeral Elliptic Curve
Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) provides PFS with excellent performance and small
key sizes. ECDHE is mandatory to implement in both HTTP/2 <xref
target="RFC7540" /> and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) <xref target="RFC7252" />.</t>


<t>AEAD algorithms that combine encryption and integrity protection are
strongly recommended for (D)TLS <xref target="RFC7525" />, and TLS 1.3 <xref
target="RFC8446"/> forbids the use of non-AEAD algorithms.
The AEAD algorithms considered in this document are AES-GCM and AES-CCM. The
use of AES-GCM in TLS is defined in <xref target="RFC5288" />, and the
use of AES-CCM is defined in <xref target="RFC6655" />.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC4279"/> defines PSK cipher suites
for TLS but does not consider elliptic curve cryptography. <xref
target="RFC8422"/> introduces elliptic curve cryptography for TLS but
does not consider PSK authentication. <xref target="RFC5487"/> describes
the use of AES-GCM in combination with PSK authentication but does not
consider ECDHE. <xref target="RFC5489"/> describes the use of PSK in
combination with ECDHE but does not consider AES-GCM or AES-CCM.</t>

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",

<section title="ECDHE_PSK with AES-GCM and AES-CCM Cipher Suites">

<t>
   The cipher suites defined in this document are based on the following 
   AES-GCM and AES-CCM AEAD algorithms: AEAD_AES_128_GCM <xref target="RFC5116"/>,
   AEAD_AES_256_GCM <xref target="RFC5116"/>, AEAD_AES_128_CCM <xref target="RFC5116"/>, and
   AEAD_AES_128_CCM_8 <xref target="RFC6655"/>.
</t>


<t>Messages and premaster secret construction in this document are
defined in <xref target="RFC5489"/>. The ServerKeyExchange and
ClientKeyExchange messages are used, and the premaster secret is computed
as for the ECDHE_PSK key exchange. The elliptic curve parameters used
in the Diffie-Hellman parameters are negotiated using extensions defined
in <xref target="RFC8422"/>.</t>

<t>For TLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.2, the following cipher suites are defined:</t>

<figure ><artwork align="left"><![CDATA[
TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256   = {0xD0,0x01}
TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384   = {0xD0,0x02}
TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256 = {0xD0,0x03}
TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_SHA256   = {0xD0,0x05}
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The assigned code points can only be used for TLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.2.</t>


<t> The cipher suites defined in this document MUST NOT be negotiated for any
version of (D)TLS other than version 1.2.  Servers MUST NOT select one of these
cipher suites when selecting a (D)TLS version other than version 1.2.  
A client MUST
treat the selection of these cipher suites in combination with a different
version of (D)TLS as an error and generate a fatal 'illegal_parameter' TLS
alert.</t>

<t>Cipher suites TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256, and TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256 are used to support
equivalent functionality in TLS 1.3 <xref target="RFC8446"/>.</t>

<section title="IANA Considerations">

<t>This document defines the following new cipher suites for TLS 1.2 and DTLS
1.2. The values have been assigned in the "TLS Cipher Suites" registry defined by
<xref target="RFC8446"/> and <xref target="RFC8447"/>.</t>

<figure ><artwork align="left"><![CDATA[

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>The security considerations in TLS 1.2 <xref target="RFC5246"/>, DTLS
1.2 <xref target="RFC6347" />, PSK Ciphersuites for TLS <xref
target="RFC4279"/>, ECDHE_PSK <xref target="RFC5489"/>,
AES-GCM <xref target="RFC5288"/>, and AES-CCM <xref target="RFC6655"/>
apply to this document as well.</t>

<t>All the cipher suites defined in this document provide
confidentiality, mutual authentication, and forward secrecy. The
AES-128 cipher suites provide 128-bit security, and the AES-256 cipher
suites provide at least 192-bit security. However, AES_128_CCM_8 only
provides 64-bit security against message forgery.</t>

<t>The pre-shared keys used for authentication MUST have a security level equal
to or higher than the cipher suite used, i.e., at least 128-bit security for the AES-128
cipher suites and at least 192-bit security for the AES-256 cipher suites.</t>

<t>GCM or CCM encryption that reuses a nonce with a same key undermines the
security of GCM and CCM.
As a
result, GCM and CCM MUST only be used with a system guaranteeing nonce
uniqueness <xref target="RFC5116"/>.</t>
