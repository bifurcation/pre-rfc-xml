	<abstract>
		<t> This memo updates the registry of authentication method
		    results in Authentication-Results: message header fields,
		    correcting a discontinuity between the original
		    registry creation and the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) specification. </t>

		<t> This memo updates RFC 5451. </t>
	</abstract>

<middle>
	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> <xref target="AUTHRES"/> defined a new header field
		    for electronic mail messages that presents the results of
		    a message authentication effort in a machine-readable
		    format.  That Request for Comments created a registry
		    of results for a few message authentication mechanisms,
		    one of which was the Sender Policy Framework
		    <xref target="SPF"/>.  The registry contains one entry
		    that is inconsistent with the latter specification, which
		    was noted in an erratum <xref target="ERR2617" /> filed with the RFC Editor.


		    This memo updates the IANA registries accordingly. </t>

		<t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
		    "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",

		    document are to be interpreted as described in
		    <xref target="KEYWORDS"/>. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="fail" title="New 'fail' Definition">
		<t> The new "fail" result, replacing the existing
		    "hardfail" result for <xref target="SPF"/> (and thus
		    also for <xref target="SENDER-ID"/>) has the same
		    definition for "hardfail" that was used in
		    Section 2.4.2 of <xref target="AUTHRES"/>, namely:

		    <list style="empty">
		    	<t> This client is explicitly not authorized to inject
			    or relay mail using the sender's DNS domain. </t>
		    </list> </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
		<t> This section enumerates requested actions of IANA, per
		    <xref target="IANA"/>. </t>

		<section anchor="iana_status"
		         title="Addition of 'Status' Columns">
			<t> IANA has amended the Email Authentication
			    Methods and Email Authentication Result Names
			    registries, both in the Email Authentication
			    Parameters group, by adding to each a column
			    called "Status" that will indicate for each entry
			    its current status.  Legal values for
			    these columns are as follows:

			    <list style="hanging">
				<t hangText="active:"> The entry is in current
					use. </t>

				<t hangText="deprecated:"> The entry is no
					longer in current use. </t>
			    </list> </t>

			<t> New registrations to either table MUST specify
			    one of these values. </t>

			<t> All existing entries, except as specified below,
			    are to be noted as "active" as of publication of
			    this memo. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="iana_spf" title="Update to Result Names">
			<t> <xref target="AUTHRES"/> listed "hardfail" as
			    the result to be used when a message fails an
			    <xref target="SPF"/> evaluation.  However, this
			    latter specification used the string "fail"
			    to denote such failures. </t>

			<t> Therefore, IANA has marked "hardfail"
			    in the Email Authentication Result Names registry
			    as "deprecated" and amended the "fail" entry as
			    follows:

			    <list style="hanging">
				<t hangText="Code:"> fail </t>
				<t hangText="Defined:">
					<xref target="AUTHRES"/> </t>
				<t hangText="Auth Method:">
					spf, sender-id </t>
				<t hangText="Meaning:">
					[this memo] <xref target="fail"/> </t>
				<t hangText="Status:"> active </t>
			    </list> </t>
		</section>
	</section>

	<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
		<t> This memo corrects a registry error.  It is possible that
		    older implementations will not recognize or use the
		    corrected entry.  Thus, implementers are advised to
		    support both result strings for some period of time.
		    However, it is known that some implementations are already
		    using the SPF-defined result string. </t>

				<abstract>
					<t> Many protocols make use of
					    identifiers consisting of
					    constants and other well-known
					    values. Even after a protocol has
					    been defined and deployment has
					    begun, new values may need to be
					    assigned (e.g., for a new option
					    type in DHCP, or a new encryption
					    or authentication transform for
					    IPsec). To ensure that such
					    quantities have consistent values
					    and interpretations across all
					    implementations, their assignment
					    must be administered by a central
					    authority. For IETF protocols,
					    that role is provided by the
					    Internet Assigned Numbers
					    Authority (IANA). </t>

					<t> In order for IANA to manage a
					    given namespace prudently, it
					    needs guidelines describing the
					    conditions under which new
					    values can be assigned or when
					    modifications to existing values
					    can be made.  If IANA is expected
					    to play a role in the management
					    of a namespace, IANA must be given
					    clear and concise instructions
					    describing that role.  This
					    document discusses issues that
					    should be considered in
					    formulating a policy for assigning
					    values to a namespace and provides
					    guidelines for authors on the
					    specific text that must be
					    included in documents that place
					    demands on IANA. </t>
