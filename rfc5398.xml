   To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion when relating
   documented examples to deployed systems, two blocks of Autonomous
   System numbers (ASNs) are reserved for use in examples in RFCs,
   books, documentation, and the like. This document describes the
   reservation of two blocks of ASNs as reserved numbers for use in
   documentation.

   <t>
   To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion when relating
   documented examples to deployed systems, two blocks of Autonomous
   System numbers (ASNs) are reserved for use in examples in RFCs,
   books, documentation, and the like.  This document describes the
   reservation of two blocks of ASNs as reserved numbers for use in
   documentation.
   </t>
   <t>
   The problems such conflicts may cause have already been encountered
   with IPv4 addresses where literal use of documented examples in a
   production environment causes address and routing conflicts with
   existing services. Since private-use ASNs already have a context of
   use in deployed networks, these ASNs cannot be used in many example
   situations. In making an explicit allocation of a set of AS numbers
   reserved for documentation use, it is intended that any such
   operational problems may be avoided in the future.
   </t>
   <t>
   Similar considerations have been applied to IPv4 addresses <xref
   target="IANA.IPv4" />, IPv6 addresses <xref target="RFC3849" />,
   and domain names <xref target="RFC2606"/>, and reservations
   have been made for similar purposes.

 <section anchor='addr' title='ASNs for Documentation Use'>
   <t>
   To allow documentation to accurately describe deployment examples,
   the use of public or private-use AS numbers is inappropriate, and a
   reserved block of AS numbers is required. This ensures that
   documentation does not clash with public- or private-use AS numbers
   in deployed networks, and mitigates the risks to operational
   integrity of the network through inappropriate use of documentation
   to perform literal configuration of routing elements on production
   systems.
   </t>
   <t>
   To allow for examples relating to the transition to use of 32-bit
   AS numbers to be correctly described, a reservation of two blocks of
   AS numbers is proposed in this document. One reserved block of 16
   contiguous AS numbers is to lie in the range of numbers that can be
   expressed as a 16-bit AS number value (i.e., values less than
   65536), and a second reserved block of 16 contiguous AS numbers is
   to lie in the range of numbers that can only be expressed as 32-bit
   AS numbers (values greater than 65535).
   </t>
 </section>
 <section anchor='ops' title='Operational Implications'>
   <t>
   This assignment implies that BGP operational configurations should
   not peer with neighboring ASes that are numbered from this reserved
   AS number set.
   </t>
 </section>
 <section anchor='iana' title='IANA Considerations'>
   <t>
   IANA has reserved a contiguous block of 16 Autonomous
   System numbers from the unallocated number range within the
   "16-bit" number set for documentation purposes, namely 64496 - 64511, and a contiguous block
   of 16 Autonomous System numbers from the "32-bit" number set for
   documentation, namely 65536
   - 65551. These reservations have been documented in the IANA AS
   Number Registry <xref target="IANA.AS" />.
   </t>
 </section>
 <section anchor='security' title='Security Considerations'>
   <t>
   AS number reservations do not have any direct impact on Internet
   infrastructure security.

   <t>
   The author acknowledges the work of Tomoya Yoshida, Gaurab Upadhaya,
   and Philip Smith in authoring a policy proposal that was submitted
   to the APNIC Policy Process in 2008 relating to the reservation of
   AS numbers for documentation purposes.
