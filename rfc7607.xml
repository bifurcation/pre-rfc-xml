    <abstract>
<t>
This document updates RFC 4271 and proscribes the use of Autonomous
System (AS) 0 in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) OPEN, AS_PATH,
AS4_PATH,  AGGREGATOR, and AS4_AGGREGATOR attributes.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Autonomous System 0 was listed in the IANA Autonomous System Number
      Registry as "Reserved - May be use [sic] to identify non-routed networks"
      (<xref target="IANA.AS_Numbers"></xref>).</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC6491"></xref> specifies that AS 0 in a
      Route Origin Attestation (ROA) is used to mark a prefix and all its more
      specific prefixes as not to be used in a routing context. This allows a
      resource holder to signal that a prefix (and the more specifics) should
      not be routed by publishing a ROA listing AS 0 as the only origin. To
      respond to this signal requires that BGP implementations not accept or
      propagate routes containing AS 0.</t>

      <t>No clear statement that AS 0 was proscribed could be found in any BGP
      specification. This document corrects this omission, most importantly in
      the case of the AS_PATH. This represents an update to the error handling
      procedures given in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 of <xref target="RFC4271"></xref>
      by specifying the behavior in the presence of AS 0.</t>

      <t>At least two implementations discard routes containing AS 0, and this
      document codifies this behavior.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Notation">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Behavior">
      <t>A BGP speaker MUST NOT originate or propagate a route with an AS
      number of zero in the AS_PATH, AS4_PATH, AGGREGATOR, or AS4_AGGREGATOR
      attributes.</t>

      <t>An UPDATE message that contains the AS number of zero in the AS_PATH
      or AGGREGATOR attribute MUST be considered as malformed and be handled
      by the procedures specified in <xref
      target="RFC7606"></xref>.</t>

      <t>An UPDATE message that contains the AS number of zero in the AS4_PATH
      or AS4_AGGREGATOR attribute MUST be considered as malformed and be
      handled by the procedures specified in <xref
      target="RFC6793"></xref>.</t>

      <t>If a BGP speaker receives zero as the peer AS in an OPEN message, it
      MUST abort the connection and send a NOTIFICATION with Error Code "OPEN
      Message Error" and subcode "Bad Peer AS" (see Section 6 of <xref
      target="RFC4271"></xref>). A router MUST NOT initiate a
      connection claiming to be AS 0.</t>

      <t>Authors of future protocol extensions that carry the Autonomous
      System number are encouraged to keep in mind that AS 0 is
      reserved and to provide clear direction on how to handle AS 0.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
  The IANA has updated the registry for "16-bit Autonomous
  System Numbers" so that the entry for AS 0 is simply "Reserved".
    </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>By allowing a Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) resource
      holder to issue a ROA saying that AS 0 is the only valid origin for a
      route, we allow them to state that a particular address resource is not
      in use. By ensuring that all implementations that see AS 0 in a route
      ignore that route, we prevent a malicious party from announcing routes
      containing AS 0 in an attempt to hijack those resources.</t>

      <t>In addition, by standardizing the behavior upon reception of an
      AS_PATH (or AS4_PATH) containing AS 0, this document makes the behavior
      better defined.</t>

<abstract><t>According to the base BGP specification, a BGP speaker that receives an UPDATE message containing a malformed attribute is required to reset the session over which the offending attribute was received. This behavior is undesirable, because a session reset would impact not only routes with the offending attribute, but also other, valid routes exchanged over the session.  This document partially revises the error handling for UPDATE messages and provides guidelines for the authors of documents defining new attributes.  Finally, it revises the error handling procedures for a number of existing attributes.  This document updates error handling for RFCs 1997, 4271, 4360, 4456, 4760, 5543, 5701 and 6368.</t></abstract>
