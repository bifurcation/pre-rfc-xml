<abstract>
<t>
This document describes the framework for an RFC Series and an RFC Editor 
function
that incorporate the principles of  organized community involvement and
accountability that has become necessary as the Internet 
technical community has grown, thereby enabling the RFC Series
to continue to fulfill its mandate.
</t>

</abstract>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
<t>
The first Request for Comments (RFC) document was published in April
of 1969 as part of the effort to design and build
what we now know of as the Internet.  Since then, the RFC Series
has been the archival series dedicated to documenting
Internet technical specifications, including both general
contributions from the Internet research and engineering
community as well as standards documents.
</t>

<t>
As described in the history of the first 30 years of RFCs
(<xref target="RFC2555"/>), the RFC Series was created for the purpose
of capturing the research and engineering thought that underlie
the design of (what we now know of as) the Internet.   As the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) was formalized to carry out
the discussion and documentation of Internet standards, IETF documents
have become a large part (but not the entirety) of the RFC Series.  
</t>
<t>
As the IETF has grown up and celebrated its own 20 years of 
history, its requirements for archival publication of its output
have changed and become more rigorous.  Perhaps most significantly,
the IETF must be able to define (based on its own open consensus
discussion processes and leadership directions) and implement
adjustments to its publication processes.
</t>
<t>
At the same time, the Internet engineering and research community
as a whole has grown and come to require more openness and accountability
in all organizations supporting it. More than ever, this community
needs an RFC Series that is supported (operationally and in terms of
its principles)
such that there is a balance of:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
expert implementation;
</t>
<t>
clear management and direction -- for operations and evolution across
the whole RFC Series (whether originating in the IETF or not); and 
</t>
<t>
appropriate community input into and review of activities.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
Today, there is confusion and therefore sometimes tension over 
where and how to address RFC issues that are particular to
contributing groups (e.g., the IETF, the Internet Architecture Board
(IAB), or independent individuals). It isn't clear where there should
be community involvement versus RFC Editor control; depending on the
issue, there might be more or less involvement from the IAB, the
Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), or the
community at large. There are similar issues with handling RFC
Series-wide issues -- where to discuss and resolve them in a way that
is balanced across the whole series.
</t>

<?rfc needLines="3"?>
<t>
For example, there are current discussions about Intellectual Property
Rights (IPR) for IETF-generated documents, but it's not clear when or
how to abstract the portions of those discussions that are relevant
to the rest of the RFC Series.  Discussions of labeling (of
RFCs in general, IETF documents in particular, or some combination
thereof) generally must be applied on an RFC Series-wide basis or
not at all.  Without an agreed-on framework for managing the RFC Series, it is 
difficult to have those discussions in a non-polarized fashion -- 
either the IETF dictating the reality of the rest of the RFC Series, or the 
RFC Series imposing undue restrictions on the IETF document series.  
</t>
<t>
As part of its charter (see <xref target="iabcharterhistory"/>), the IAB has 
a responsibility for the RFC Editor.  Acknowledging the IETF's
and the general Internet engineering and research community's evolving
needs, the IAB would like to see a future for the RFC Series that
continues to meet its original mandate of providing the archival
series for the technical research and engineering documentation that
describes the Internet.  
</t>
<t>
With this document, the IAB provides the framework for the 
RFC Series and an RFC Editor function with the specific purpose
of ensuring that the RFC Series is
maintained and supported in ways that
are consistent with the stated purpose of the RFC Series 
and the realities of today's Internet research and engineering community.
The framework describes the existing "streams" of RFCs, draws a 
roadmap of existing process documents already defining the 
implementation, 
and provides clear direction of how to evolve
this framework and its supporting pieces through discussion and
future document revision.
</t>
<t>
Specifically, this document provides a brief charter for the RFC Series,
describes the role of the RFC Editor, the IAB, and the IETF
Administrative Support Activity (IASA) in a framework
for managing the RFC Series, and  discusses the streams of input to the 
RFC Series from the various constituencies it serves.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="charter" title="RFC Series Mission">
<t>
The RFC Series is the archival series dedicated to documenting Internet 
technical specifications, including general
contributions from the Internet research and engineering
community as well as standards documents.
</t>
<t>
RFCs are available free of charge to anyone via the Internet. 
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="roles" title="Roles and Responsibilities">
<t>
As this document proposes changes to the framework for supporting the
RFC Series mission, this section reviews the planned roles and 
responsibilities of the entities that have had, and will have, 
involvement in continued support of the mission.
</t>
<section title="RFC Editor">
<t>
Originally, there was a single person acting as editor of the RFC
Series (the RFC Editor).  The task has grown, and the work now 
requires the organized activity of several experts, so there are
RFC Editors, or an RFC Editor organization.  In time, there may be
multiple organizations working together to undertake the work required
by the RFC Series.  For simplicity's sake, and without attempting
to predict how the role might be subdivided among them, this document 
refers to this collection of experts and organizations as the "RFC Editor".
</t>
<t>
The RFC Editor is an expert technical editor and series editor, acting to 
support the mission of the RFC Series.  As such, the RFC Editor
is the implementer handling the editorial management of the RFC 
Series, in accordance with the defined processes.
In addition, the RFC Editor is expected to be the expert and prime
mover in discussions about policies for editing, publishing, and archiving RFCs.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="iab" title="IAB">
<t>
In this model, the role of the IAB is to ensure that the RFC Series mission 
is being appropriately fulfilled for the whole community for which it was 
created.
The IAB does not,
organizationally, have comprehensive publishing or editorial expertise. 
Therefore, the role of the IAB as put forward in this document
is focused on ensuring that principles are met, the appropriate
bodies and communities are duly informed and consulted, and
the RFC Editor has what it needs in order to execute
on the material that is in their mandate.
</t>
<t>
It is the responsibility of the IAB to approve the
appointment of the RFC Editor and to approve the general
policy followed by the RFC Editor.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="ops" title="Operational Oversight">
<t>
The IETF Administrative Support Activity
(BCP 101, <xref target="BCP101"/>) was created to provide
administrative support for the IETF, the IAB, and the Internet
Research Task Force (IRTF). In its role of supporting 
<?rfc needLines="2"?>
the IAB, the IASA is tasked with
providing the funding for and operational oversight of the RFC Editor.
</t>
<t>
The IAOC (IETF Administrative Oversight Committee) is the oversight
board of the IASA, and the IAD (IETF Administrative Director)
is the chief actor for the IASA.
</t>
<t>
The IAOC works with the IAB to identify suitable persons or entities
to fulfill the mandate of the RFC Editor.
</t>
<t>
The IAOC establishes appropriate
contractual agreements with the selected persons or entities
to carry out the work that will satisfy the technical publication requirements
defined for the various RFC input streams (see <xref target="reqs"/>).
The IAOC may define additional operational requirements and policies
for management purposes to meet the requirements defined
by the various communities.    
</t>
<t>
In accordance with BCP 101, the IAOC provides oversight of the
operation of the RFC Editor activity based on the established
agreements.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Policy Oversight">
<t>
The IAB monitors the effectiveness of the policies in force and
their implementation to ensure that the RFC Editor activity
meets the editorial management and document publication needs
as referenced in this document. In the event of serious non-conformance,  
the IAB, either on its own initiative or at the request of the IAOC, may 
require the IAOC to vary or terminate and renegotiate the arrangements for 
the RFC Editor activity. 
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="framework" title="Framework">
<t>
With the RFC Series mission outlined above, this document describes a
framework for supporting 
</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>
    the operational implementation of the RFC Series, 
  </t>
</list></t>

<t>
based on
</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
    <t>
      public process and definition documents, 
    </t>
</list></t>

<t>
for which there are 
</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
    <t>
      clear responsibilities and mechanisms for update and change.
    </t>
</list></t>

<?rfc needLines="3"?>
<t>
Generally speaking, the RFC Editor is responsible for the 
operational implementation of the RFC Series.  As outlined
in <xref target="ops"/>, the IAD provides the oversight
of this operational role.
</t>
<t>
The process and definition documents are detailed below, including
responsibility for the individual process documents (maintenance
and update).  The 
RFC Editor works with the appropriate community to ensure that the
process documents reflect current requirements.  The IAB is charged
with the role of verifying that appropriate community input has been
sought and that any changes appropriately account for community
requirements.
</t>
<t>
There are 3 categories of activity, and a 4th category of series-wide 
rules and guidelines, described for implementing the RFC Series to support 
its mission:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
Approval of documents.
</t>
<t>
Editing, processing, and publication of documents.
</t>
<t>
Archiving and indexing the documents and making them accessible.
</t>
<t>
Series rules and guidelines.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<section title="Document Approval">
<t>
The RFC Series mission implicitly requires that documents be
reviewed and approved for acceptance into the series.  
</t>
<section title="Definition">
<t>
<xref target="approval"/> describes the different streams of documents
that are put to the RFC Editor for publication as RFCs today. 
While there may be general policies for approval of documents as
RFCs (to ensure the coherence of the RFC Series), there are also policies
defined for the approval of documents in each stream.  Generally
speaking, there is a different approving body for each stream.  The
current definitions are catalogued in <xref target="approval"/>.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Operational Implementation">
<t>
Each stream has its own documented approval process. The RFC Editor
is responsible for the approval of documents in one of the
streams (Independent Submission stream, see  <xref target="independent-approval"/>) and works with the other approving bodies to 
ensure smooth passage of approved documents into the next phases,
ultimately to publication and archiving as an RFC.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Process Change">
<t>
From time to time, it may be necessary to change the approval processes
for any given stream, or even add or remove streams.   This may occur
when the RFC Editor, the IAB, the body responsible for a given stream of 
documents, or the community determines that there are issues to be
resolved in general for RFC approval or for per-stream approval processes.
</t>
<t>
In this framework, the general approach is that the IAB will work with
the RFC Editor and other parties to get community input and it will verify
that any changes appropriately account for community requirements. 
</t>
</section>

<section title="Existing Approval Process Documents">
<t>
The existing documents describing the approval processes for each 
stream are detailed in <xref target="approval"/>.
</t>

</section>
</section>

<section title="Editing, Processing, and Publication of Documents">
<t>
Producing and maintaining a coherent, well-edited document series 
requires specialized skills and subject matter expertise.  This is
the domain of the RFC Editor.  Nevertheless, the community served
by the RFC Series and the communities served by the individual
streams of RFCs have requirements that help define the nature of the
series.
</t>
<section title="Definition">
<t>
General and stream-specific requirements for the RFC Series are documented
in community-approved documents (catalogued in <xref target="reqs"/>
below).
</t>
<t>
Any specific interfaces, numbers, or concrete values required to make the
requirements operational are the subject of agreements between
the IASA and the RFC Editor (e.g., contracts, statements of work, service
level agreements, etc).
</t>
</section>
<section title="Operational Implementation">
<t>
The RFC Editor is responsible for ensuring that editing, processing,
and publication of RFCs are carried out in a way that is consistent with
 the requirements
laid out in the appropriate documents.  The RFC Editor works with
the IASA to provide regular reporting and feedback on these operations.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Process Change">
<t>
From time to time, it may be necessary to change the requirements
for any given stream, or the RFC Series in general.   This may occur
when the RFC Editor, the IAB, the approval body for a given stream of 
documents, or the community determines that there are issues to be
resolved in general for RFCs or for per-stream requirements.
</t>
<t>
In this model, the general approach is that the IAB will work with the RFC Editor 
to get community input and it will approve changes 
by validating appropriate consideration of community requirements.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Existing Process Documents">
<t>
Documents describing existing requirements for the streams are
detailed in <xref target="reqs"/>.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Archiving, Indexing, and Accessibility">
<t>
The activities of archiving, indexing, and making accessible 
the RFC Series can be informed
by specific subject matter expertise in general document series editing. It is
also important that they are  
informed by requirements from the whole community.  As long
as the RFC Series is to remain coherent, there should be
uniform archiving and indexing of RFCs across all streams and a 
common method of accessing the resulting documents.
</t>
<section title="Definition">
<t>
In principle, there should be a community consensus document describing
the archiving, indexing, and accessibility requirements for the RFC Series.  In practice,
we continue with the archive as built by the capable RFC Editors
since the series' inception.
</t>
<t>
Any specific concrete requirements for the archive,  index, and
accessibility
operations are the subject of agreements between
the IASA and the RFC Editor (e.g., contracts, statements of work, service
level agreements, etc).
</t>

</section>
<section title="Operational Implementation">
<t>
The RFC Editor is responsible for ensuring that the RFC archive and
index are maintained appropriately and that the resulting documents are made available to anybody wishing to access them via the Internet.
The RFC Editor works with
the IASA for regular reporting and feedback.

</section>
<section title="Process Change">

Should there be a community move to propose changes to the requirements
for the RFC archive and index or accessibility,  the IAB will work with 
the RFC Editor to get community input and it will approve changes 
by validating appropriate consideration of community requirements.

<section title="Existing Process Documents">
<t>
There are no applicable process documents.

</section>

<section title="Series-Wide Guidelines and Rules">
<t>
   The RFC Series style and content can be shaped
   by subject matter expertise in document series editing.  They are also informed by
   requirements by the using community.  As long as the RFC Series is to
   remain coherent, there should be uniform style and content for 
   RFCs across all streams.   This includes, but is not limited
   to, acceptable language, use of references, and copyright rules.
</t>
<section title="Definition">
<t>
   In principle, there should be a community consensus document
   (or set of documents) describing the content requirements for the RFC
   Series.  In practice, some do exist, though some need reviewing
   and more may be needed over time.

<section anchor="streams" title="RFC Streams">
<t>
Various contributors provide input to the RFC Series.  These
contributors come from several different communities, each
with its own defined process for approving documents that
will be published by the RFC Editor.  This is nothing new;
however, over time the various communities and document
requirements have grown and separated.  In order to promote
harmony in discussing the collective set of requirements,
it is useful to recognize each in their own space -- and they
are referred to here as "streams".  
</t>
<t>
Note that by identifying separate streams, there is no intention
of dividing them or undermining their management as one series.  Rather,
the opposite is true -- by clarifying the constituent parts, 
it is easier to make them work together without the friction that
sometimes arises when discussing various requirements.
</t>
<t>
The subsections below identify the streams that exist today. 
There is no immediate expectation of new streams being created
and it is preferable that new streams NOT be created.
Creation of streams and all policies surrounding general changes
to the RFC Series are discussed above in <xref target="framework"/>.

<section anchor="approval" title="RFC Approval Processes">

Processes for 
approval of documents (or requirements) for each stream are defined

<t>
The Internet engineering and research community has not only grown,
it has become more diverse, and sometimes more demanding.  The IETF,
as a standards-developing organization, has publication requirements
that extend beyond those of an academic journal.  The IAB does not
have the same interdependence with IANA assignments as the IETF
stream does.  Therefore, there is the need to both codify the
publishing requirements of each stream, and endeavor to harmonize
them to the extent that is reasonable.
</t>

<?rfc needLines="3"?>
<t>
Therefore, it is expected that the community of effort behind
each document stream will outline their technical publication 
requirements.

<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
<t>
The processes for the publication of documents must prevent the
introduction of unapproved changes.  Since the RFC Editor
maintains the index of publications, sufficient security
must be in place to prevent these published documents from being
changed by external parties. 
The archive of RFC documents, any source documents needed to recreate the RFC 
documents, and any associated original documents (such as lists of errata, 
tools, and, for some early items, non-machine readable originals) need to be 
secured against failure of the storage medium and other similar disasters.

<section anchor="iabcharterhistory" title="A Retrospective of IAB Charters
and RFC Editor">
<t>
With this document, the IAB's role with respect to the RFC Series
and the RFC Editor is being adjusted to work more directly with the
RFC Editor and provide oversight to ensure the RFC Series mission
principles and communities' input are addressed appropriately.
</t>
<t>
This section provides an overview of the role of the IAB with respect
to the RFC Editor as it has been presented in IAB Charter RFCs dating
back to 1992.  The point of this section is that the IAB's role has
historically been
substantive -- whether it is supposed to be directly responsible for the
RFC Series' editorial management (circa 1992, <xref target="1992"/>), or appointment of
the RFC Editor organization and approval of general policy (circa 2000, <xref target="2000"/>).

         Comments (RFC) document series, which constitutes the
         archival publication series for Internet Standards and
         related contributions by the Internet research and
         engineering community.

[The IAB's] responsibilities under this charter include:

 (d) RFC Series and IANA

    The IAB is responsible for editorial management and publication of
    the Request for Comments (RFC) document series, and for
    administration of the various Internet assigned numbers.

which it elaborates as

 2.4 RFC Series and Assigned Numbers

    The RFC Series constitutes the archival publication channel for
    Internet Standards and for other contributions by the Internet
    research and engineering community.  The IAB shall select an RFC
    Editor, who shall be responsible for the editorial management and
    publication of the RFC Series.

 (d) RFC Series and IANA

 The RFC Editor executes editorial management and publication of the
 IETF "Request for Comment" (RFC) document series, which is the
 permanent document repository of the IETF.  The RFC Series
 constitutes the archival publication channel for Internet Standards
 and for other contributions by the Internet research and engineering
 community.  RFCs are available free of charge to anyone via the
 Internet.  The IAB must approve the appointment of an organization to
 act as RFC Editor and the general policy followed by the RFC Editor.
