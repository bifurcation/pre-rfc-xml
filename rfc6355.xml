    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a new DHCPv6 Unique Identifier (DUID)
      type called DUID-UUID. DUID-UUIDs are derived from the 
      already-standardized Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) format. 
      DUID-UUID makes it possible for
      devices to use UUIDs to identify themselves to DHC servers and
      vice versa. UUIDs are globally unique and readily available on
      many systems, making them convenient identifiers to leverage
      within DHCP.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

    <t> DHCP Unique Identifiers (DUIDs) are used in DHCPv6 to identify
      clients and servers.  This document defines a new DHCP Unique
      Identifier (DUID) type that embeds a Universally Unique
      IDentifier (UUID) <xref target="RFC4122"></xref>. UUIDs are
      already in widespread use and serve as an existing identifier
      that could be leveraged by DHCPv6. For example, x86-based
      systems ship with an embedded UUID in firmware that is readily
      available to the software running on the device. </t>

     <t> Although DUIDs are new to DHCPv6, identifying clients in DHCP
     via a UUID is not.  DHCPv4 <xref target="RFC2132"></xref> defines
     a Client Machine Identifier Option (option 97) that embeds a UUID
     (aka a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID)) <xref target="RFC4578"></xref>.  This document extends
     that capability to DHCPv6.</t>

     <t>Terminology specific to IPv6 and DHCPv6 is used as defined in the "Terminology" sections
     of <xref target="RFC3315"></xref>.
     </t>
     
     </section>

     
    <section title="Background">

	
      <t>In DHCPv6, clients identify themselves to servers via DHCP
      Unique Identifiers (DUIDs) <xref target="RFC3315"></xref>. DUIDs
      are identifiers that DHCP servers treat as opaque objects with
      no internal structure. DUIDs are intended to be globally unique,
      with no two devices using the same DUID.  Three DUIDs types have
      been defined previously: </t>

     <t><list hangIndent="12" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="DUID-LLT -">the Link-Layer address of one of
          the device's network interfaces, concatenated with a
          timestamp</t>

          <t hangText="DUID-EN -">an Enterprise Number plus
          additional information specific to the enterprise</t>
	  
          <t hangText="DUID-LL -">the Link-Layer address of one of
          the device's network interfaces</t>
        </list> </t>

     <t> DUIDs are intended to remain constant over time, so that they
     can be used as permanent identifiers for a device. In the case of
     DUID-LLTs, they are intended to be generated once, 
     stored in stable storage, and reused from that point forward. </t>

     <t> One issue that has arisen concerns devices that employ
     multi-step network boot loading. An initial step (typically run
     out of firmware) loads a small image that, in turn, loads a second
     image and so forth until the actual target system is
     loaded. Each step in the booting process may invoke DHCP. In some
     operational environments, it is important that each step in the
     sequence use the same DUID, so that the server knows it is
     getting requests from the same device and can return the proper
     configuration information (including the pointer to the correct
     image to load).  </t>

     
     <t> Unfortunately, none of the previously defined DUIDs are ideal
     for multi-step network booting.  The DUID-LLT and DUID-LL
     identifiers that a given device may use are not guaranteed to
     remain constant across each booting step. Even if the different
     stages used DUID-LL or DUID-LLT, on devices with multiple
     interfaces, there is no way to guarantee that the same interface
     (and hence DUID) will be selected. Finally, in the case of
     DUID-LLT, even if the same interface is chosen, it can be
     difficult to ensure that each stage uses the same timestamp
     value. While a DUID-EN could be defined and used, such usage
     is proprietary by definition.  </t>

     <t> This document defines a new DUID type, based on the
     Universally Unique IDentifier
     (UUID) <xref target="RFC4122"></xref>. UUIDs are already used in
     practice and serve as an existing identifier that could be
     leveraged by DHCP. In some environments, a UUID-based DUID is
     preferable to the other existing DUID types.</t>
     
     <t>It should be noted that use of a DUID-UUID will not, by itself,
     solve all the network boot problems described in this
     document. Given the availability of a suitable DUID-UUID,
     implementations will still need to take steps to ensure that all
     boot stages use the same DUID-UUID as appropriate. Given that
     DHCP has already defined multiple DUID types, the question of
     which of several DUIDs to select from already exists, and
     defining a new DUID type does not, by itself, help. It is believed,
     however, that network boot services can be configured to use a
     DUID-UUID and that other software can do so as well. Ensuring
     this happens in general is beyond the scope of this
     document.  </t>

    </section>
     
    <section title="UUID Considerations">

     <t> Although many UUIDs are in use today, not all UUIDs meet
     DHCP's requirements (see Section 9
     of <xref target="RFC3315"></xref>).  DHCP UUIDs should be
     persistent across system restarts, system reconfiguration
     events, system software and operating system upgrades or
     reinstallation as well as be easily available to any part of the boot
     process that requires access to the DHCP UUID.  For example,
     UUIDs used in Microsoft's Component Object Module (COM), and for
     labeling partitions in filesystems, are likely not appropriate as
     they may not be accessible to firmware boot loaders and can
     change over time.</t>

     <t>Implementations of this specification using DUID-UUID must
      select a UUID that is persistent across system restart and
      reconfiguration events and that is available to all DHCP
      protocol agents that may need to identify themselves.  For
      instance, a UUID that is part of the system firmware, or managed
      by the system firmware, satisfies this requirement. </t>

      <t>The DUID-UUID is carried within Client Identifier or Server

    <t>This document was inspired by a discussion on the DHC mailing
    list in November 2009 on the topic of netboot for
    IPv6. Specifically, some scenarios were described where it was
    difficult to do something in DHCPv6 that had worked well in
    DHCPv4.</t>
