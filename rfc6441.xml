<abstract>

<t>
   
It has been common for network administrators to filter IP traffic from 
and BGP prefixes of unallocated IPv4 address space. Now that there are no 
longer any unallocated IPv4 /8s, this practise is more complicated, fragile, 
and expensive. Network administrators are advised to remove filters 
based on the registration status of the address space.

</t>

<t>

This document explains why any remaining packet and BGP prefix filters for 
unallocated IPv4 /8s should now be removed on border routers and documents 
those IPv4 unicast prefixes that should not be routed across the public Internet.

<section title="Terminology">
      
<t>
         
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", 
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.

</t>

<t>

Martians <xref target="RFC1208"/> is a humorous term applied to packets that turn up 
unexpectedly on the wrong network because of bogus routing entries.  
It is also used as a name for a packet that has an altogether bogus
(non-registered or ill-formed) Internet address.  Bogons <xref target="RFC3871"/> are 
packets sourced from addresses that have not yet been allocated by IANA 
or the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), or addresses reserved for 
private or special use by RFCs <xref target="RFC5735"/>. Bogons are referred to as "Dark IP" 
in some circles.
</t>

<section title="Traffic Filtering Options">

<section title="No Longer Filtering Based on Address Registration Status">

<t>

Network administrators who implemented filters for unallocated IPv4 /8s
did so in the knowledge that those /8s were not a legitimate source of 
traffic on the Internet and that there was a small number of bogon filters
to implement. Now that there are no longer any unallocated unicast IPv4 
/8s, there will be legitimate Internet traffic coming from all unicast /8s 
that are not reserved for special purposes in an RFC.

</t>

<t>

Removing packet and prefix filters based on the registration status of the 
IPv4 address is a simple approach that will avoid blocking legitimate Internet
traffic.  Network operators SHOULD remove both ingress and egress packet filters 
as well as BGP prefix filters for previously unallocated IPv4 /8s.
   
</t>
   
</section>

<section title="Continuing to Filter Traffic from Unallocated IPv4 Space">

<t>
      
Some network administrators might want to continue filtering unallocated IPv4 
addresses managed by the RIRs. This requires significantly more granular 
ingress filters and the highly dynamic nature of the RIRs' address pools means 
that filters need to be updated on a daily basis to avoid blocking legitimate 
incoming traffic.
      
</t>
 
</section>
</section>
   
<section title="Prefixes That Should Not be Routed across the Internet">

<t> 

Network operators may deploy filters that block traffic destined for
Martian prefixes. Currently, the Martian prefix table is defined by
<xref target="RFC5735"/> which reserves each Martian prefix for some
specific, special use. If the Martian prefix table ever changes, that
change will be documented in an RFC that either updates or obsoletes
<xref target="RFC5735"/>.
</t>   

</section>
   
<section title='Security Considerations'>

   <t>
      
The cessation of filters based on unallocated IPv4 /8 allocations is an
evolutionary step towards reasonable security filters.  While these
filters are no longer necessary, and in fact harmful, this does not
obviate the need to continue other security solutions.  These other
solutions are as necessary today as they ever were.
