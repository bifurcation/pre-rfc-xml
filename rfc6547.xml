      <t>This document moves "Use of /127 Prefix Length Between
      Routers Considered Harmful" (RFC 3627) to Historic status to reflect the
updated guidance contained in "Using 127-Bit IPv6 Prefixes on
      Inter-Router Links" (RFC 6164). A Standards Track document
supersedes an informational document; therefore, guidance provided in RFC 6164 is to be
      followed when the two documents are in conflict.  This document
links the two RFCs so that the IETF's updated guidance on this topic is clearer.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document moves "Use of /127 Prefix Length Between
      Routers Considered Harmful" <xref target="RFC3627"></xref> to
      Historic status in accordance with <xref
      target="RFC2026">RFC&nbsp;2026</xref>. RFC 3627 has been superseded by
"Using 127-Bit IPv6 Prefixes on Inter-Router Links" <xref
      target="RFC6164"></xref>. A Standards Track document
      supersedes an informational document; therefore, guidance provided in RFC 6164 is
      to be followed when the two documents are in
      conflict.  This may not have been clear to casual readers who are not
      familiar with the differences in IETF document types. This document adds
      the necessary link between the two RFCs so that users referring to
      RFC 3627 for guidance will see that it has been obsoleted by updated
      guidance on the matter, thus hopefully eliminating any confusion that
      may be present.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->

    <!-- Change Log

v00 2006-03-15  EBD   Initial version

v01 2006-04-03  EBD   Moved PI location back to position 1 -
                      v3.1 of XMLmind is better with them at this location.
v02 2007-03-07  AH    removed extraneous nested_list attribute,
                      other minor corrections
v03 2007-03-09  EBD   Added comments on null IANA sections and fixed heading capitalization.
                      Modified comments around figure to reflect non-implementation of
                      figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                      Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
                      added discussion of rfc include.
v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative 
                      images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).  -->
