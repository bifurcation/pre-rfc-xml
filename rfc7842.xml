<t>
The web-based IETF email archive search tool based on the requirements captured
in RFC 6778 was deployed in January 2014. This memo captures the requirements
for a set of improvements that have been identified during its initial years
of community use.

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
<t>
The IETF email archive search tool, as specified in <xref target="RFC6778"/>)
and available at <xref target="mailarch"/>, 
has been in use for nearly two years. During that time, there have been 
repeated requests for several improvements. This memo captures the requirements 
for a concerted development effort to provide those improvements.
</t>
</section>

<section title="List Search and Archive Tool Improvement Requirements">


<section title="Viewing by Thread">

<t>
Currently, when the "Group by Thread" button is selected, the resulting list of messages is flat.
It is very hard to tell where a thread starts and stops. This flat view interacts badly with
sorting (triggered by clicking on the column headers), leading to results that are confusing
and sometimes incorrect.
</t>

<t>
This effort will:
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="o">
  Modify the message list display, when grouped by thread, to show each thread hierarchically.
</t>
<t hangText="o">
  Modify the sort performed by the clicking on the column headers to sort the overall list first
  by the parameters in the first message in the thread, and then sort within the thread (ensuring
  the thread grouping doesn't change based on these sorts). When viewing threads sorted this way,
  the hierarchy will be flattened, but the thread boundaries will remain visibly distinct.
</t>
</list></t>

</section>

<section title="Navigation from the Message List View">
<t>
This effort will add navigation to the message list view, whether viewing
flat search results or viewing by thread, making it simple to:
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="o">
  Navigate to the previous/next message by date in the set of listed messages.
</t>
<t hangText="o">
  Navigate to 
  the previous/next message in a thread, to the first message in a thread, and to the previous/next
  thread displayed. 
</t>
<t hangText="o">
 Navigate to any References or Replies (displayed as Follow-Ups in MHonArc)
 for the currently selected message. These are derived from the References
 header field in the displayed message, and the In-Reply-To header field or
 the last value in the References header field of all other messages in the archive).
</t>
</list></t>
<t>The UI will make it possible to hide these navigation elements.</t>
</section>
<section title="Navigation from a Single Message">
<t>
Currently, when viewing a single message, the only option for navigating to related messages
is to return to the message list view (either by date or by thread). This is implemented 
with a new search based only on the details present in the message itself. No information
about any search that led to the message is retained.
</t>
<t>
This effort will:
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="o">
  Add navigation to the single message view, enabling transition to previous/next in list 
and previous/next in thread.
</t>
<t hangText="o">
  Add navigation enabling transition to previous/next
  in search, if the message page being displayed was arrived at by navigating
  from the message list view of a search result.
</t>
<t hangText="o">
 Add navigation to any References or Replies (displayed as Follow-Ups in
 MHonArc). These are derived from the References header field in the displayed
 message, and the In-Reply-To header field or the last value in the References header field of all other messages in the archive.
</t>
<t hangText="o">
  Make it possible to hide these navigation elements.
</t>
</list></t>
</section>

<section title="Message List UI">
<t>
It is not sufficiently obvious that the message list panel can be resized. The current
handle is not visually distinct enough to signal the capability to the user, leaving
many users believing they are restricted to the very short default list, even when
viewing on large monitors. 
</t><t>
Additionally, there is a flaw in the code that fetches
additional messages when scrolling to the bottom of what's currently displayed. If
the message window is large enough that the default number of results does not fill it,
no scrollbar appears, and scrolling to the bottom does not fetch additional results.
</t><t>
The filter by list and filter by from sections to the left of the message list 
have no values in many circumstances, but it is not obvious why they are missing.
One notable condition is when the search result is very large -- computing the
values to put in these filters becomes prohibitively expensive. Without foreknowledge
of the decisions captured in the code, the behavior seems arbitrary and unintuitive.
</t><t>
The current view truncates fields, leaving trailing ellipses, when it doesn't need to.
This leaves space underutilized on large displays and may make selection (particularly
of long email addresses in the filters) much more difficult than it should be. On small
displays, the column of filters dominates the display, leaving only a small amount of
space for the actual message content.
</t>
<t>
The current view requires the user to select each message in the message list to get the
URI to that message. This makes it difficult to open several messages in different
windows, or to build a list of URIs for use in a message or other applications. It is also
not obvious that double-clicking a row in the list will open the message in a separate window.
</t>
<t>
This effort will:
<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="o">
  Make the ability to resize the panels on the message list display easier to find.
</t>

<t hangText="o">
  Account for the size of the message list panel when choosing how many messages to
  fetch, filling the panel whenever there are enough results to do so.
</t>

<t hangText="o">
  Provide a message explaining any condition leading to filter values not being
  populated (such as "Refine search to enable 'From' filtering").
</t>

<t hangText="o">
  Allow subjects to fill the column on large displays. 
  Show fully expanded list and email addresses in the pop-ups for the filters.
</t>

<t hangText="o">
 Provide a link on each row of the list to the URL for that row's message.
</t>

<t hangText="o">
 Add an export type that produces a file containing a list of URIs to each message in the list.
</t>

<t hangText="o">
 Add a hint to the UI that double-clicking on a row in the list will open a single-message view of the associated message in a separate view.
</t>

</list></t>

</section>

<section title = "Improve Support for Mobile Devices">
<t>
 The current view becomes difficult to use on small displays, particularly
 phone displays in portrait mode. This effort will:
 <list style="hanging">
   <t hangText="o">Add a responsive interface, presenting a useful interface
    on both small and large displays.</t>
 </list>
</t>

</section>

<section title = "Improve Use of Display Space">
<t> The current view underutilizes the available display space.
    This effort will:
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="o">Make the message content the primary point of each view.</t>
<t hangText="o">Reduce the unused space on the display.</t> 
<t hangText="o">Remove the filter column responsively when the display width is small.</t>
</list></t>

</section>

<section title="Use without JavaScript">
<t>The current web-based archive search tool requires JavaScript to function.
This effort will extend the tool to allow users that have disabled JavaScript
in their browser to retrieve and navigate through search results using the
message list and single message views.
</t>
<t>
This effort will not attempt to preserve all of the functionality provided
with JavaScript enabled. In particular, when running with JavaScript disabled,
these features will not be available:
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="o">
  Resizing of the message list panels.
</t>
<t hangText="o">
  Dynamically filtering by time, list, or from. (The filter column will not appear).
</t>
</list>
</t>

</section>

<section title="Administration">
<t> This project will:
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="o">
Add a link from the message view to the admin page for the message when logged in as an administrator. 
</t>
<t hangText="o">
Add correction of the appropriate thread indices to the handling of administrative imports of messages.
</t>
<t hangText="o">
Implement a redirection handler mapping legacy archive URLs to the appropriate mailarch page.
</t>
<t hangText="o">
Make the underlying template consistent across all views presented by the tool. In particular, ensure 
that the correct logo as designated by the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) appears consistently on all views.
</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
The requirements for improvement to the mailarch tool captured in this document
do not introduce any exceptional security considerations.  They add additional
navigation points, and the implementers should consider the impact of rapid
navigation using these new mechanisms (see the security considerations of <xref
target="RFC6778"/>).
