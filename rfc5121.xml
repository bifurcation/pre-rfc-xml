    <abstract>
    <t>
IEEE Std 802.16 is an air interface specification for fixed and mobile
Broadband Wireless Access Systems. Service-specific convergence
sublayers to which upper-layer protocols interface are a part of the
IEEE 802.16 MAC (Medium Access Control). The Packet convergence
sublayer (CS) is used for the transport of all packet-based protocols such
as Internet Protocol (IP) and IEEE 802.3 LAN/MAN CSMA/CD Access Method
(Ethernet). IPv6 packets can be sent and received via the IP-specific
part of the Packet CS.
This document specifies the addressing and
operation of IPv6 over the IP-specific part of the Packet CS for
hosts served by a network that utilizes the IEEE Std 802.16 air
interface. It recommends the assignment of a unique prefix (or
prefixes) to each host and allows the host to use multiple
identifiers within that prefix, including support for randomly
generated interface identifiers.

<section title="Introduction">
<t>
IEEE 802.16e is an air interface for fixed and mobile broadband
wireless access systems. The IEEE 802.16 <xref target="802.16"></xref> standard
specifies the air interface, including the Medium Access Control (MAC)
layer and multiple physical layer (PHY) specifications. It can be
deployed in licensed as well as unlicensed spectrum. While the PHY and
MAC are specified in IEEE 802.16, the details of IPv4 and IPv6
operation over the air interface are not included. This document
specifies the operation of IPv6 over the IEEE 802.16 air interface.
</t>
<t>
IPv6 packets can be carried over the IEEE Std 802.16 specified air
interface via:</t>
<t><list style="numbers">
<t>the IP-specific part of the Packet CS or</t>
<t>the 802.3<xref target="802.3"></xref>-specific part of the Packet
		   CS </t>
</list></t>
<t>
The scope of this specification is limited to the operation of IPv6
over IP CS only.
</t>
<t>
The IEEE 802.16  specification includes
the PHY and MAC details. The convergence sublayers are a part of the
MAC. The packet convergence sublayer includes the IP-specific part
that is used by the IPv6 layer.
</t>
<t>
The mobile station (MS)/host is attached to an access router via a base
station (BS). The host and the BS are connected via the IEEE Std 802.16
air interface at the link and physical layers. The IPv6 link from the
MS terminates at an access router that may be a part of the BS or an
entity beyond the BS. The base station is a layer 2 entity (from the
perspective of the IPv6 link between the MS and access router (AR)) and relays
the IPv6 packets between the AR and the host via a point-to-point
connection over the air interface.

 <section anchor="802.16 IPv6 CS" title="IEEE 802.16 Convergence Sublayer Support for IPv6">
<t>
The IEEE 802.16 MAC specifies two main service-specific convergence
sublayers:
</t>
<t><list style="numbers">
<t>ATM convergence sublayer</t>
<t>Packet convergence sublayer</t>
</list></t>
<t>
The Packet CS is used for the transport of packet-based protocols,
which include:
</t>
<t><list style="numbers">
<t>IEEE Std 802.3(Ethernet)</t>
<t>Internet Protocol (IPv4 and IPv6)</t>
</list></t>
<t>
The service-specific CS resides on top of the MAC Common Part Sublayer
(CPS) as shown in Figure 1. The service-specific CS is responsible
for:
</t>
<t><list style="symbols">
<t>accepting packets (Protocol Data Units, PDUs) from the upper layer,</t>
<t>performing classification of the packet/PDU based on a set of defined
  classifiers that are service specific,</t>
<t>delivering the CS PDU to the appropriate service flow and transport
  connection, and</t>
<t>receiving PDUs from the peer entity.</t>
</list></t>
<t>
Payload header suppression (PHS) is also a function of the CS but is optional.
</t>
<t>
The figure below shows the concept of the service-specific CS in
relation to the MAC:

<t>
Classifiers for each of the specific upper-layer protocols, i.e.,
Ethernet and IP, are defined in the IEEE 802.16 specification,
which enable the packets from the upper layer to be processed by the
appropriate service-specific part of the Packet CS.
IPv6 can be transported directly over the IP-specific part of the
Packet CS (IP CS).
IPv4 packets also are transported over the IP-specific part of the
Packet CS. The classifiers used by IP CS enable the differentiation of
IPv4 and IPv6 packets and their mapping to specific transport
connections over the air interface.
</t>

<t>
The figure below shows the options for IPv6 transport over the packet
CS of IEEE 802.16:

<t>
The figure above shows that while there are multiple methods by which
IPv6 can be transmitted over an 802.16 air interface, the scope of
this document is limited to IPv6 operation over IP CS
only. Transmission of IP over Ethernet is specified
in <xref target="IPoE-over-802.16"></xref>.
Transmission of IPv4 over IP CS is specified 
in <xref target="IPv4-over-IPCS"></xref>.
</t>
<t>
It should be noted that immediately after ranging (802.16 air
interface procedure) and exchange of SBC-REQ/RSP messages (802.16
specific), the MS and BS exchange their capabilities
via REG-REQ (Registration Request) and REG-RSP
(Registration Response) 802.16 MAC messages. These management frames negotiate
parameters such as the Convergence Sublayer supported by the MS and
BS. By default, Packet, IPv4, and 802.3/Ethernet are supported. IPv6
via the IP CS is supported by the MS and the BS only when the IPv6
support bit in the capability negotiation messages (REG-REQ and
REG-RSP) implying such support is indicated in the parameter
"Classification/PHS options and SDU (Service Data Unit) encapsulation
support" (refer to <xref target="802.16"></xref>). Additionally, during the
establishment of the transport connection for transporting IPv6
packets, the DSA-REQ (Dynamic Service Addition) and DSA-RSP messages
between the BS and MS indicate via the CS-Specification TLV the CS
that the connection being set up shall use. When the IPv6 packet is
preceded by the IEEE 802.16 6-byte MAC header, there is no specific
indication in the MAC header itself about the payload type. The
processing of the packet is based entirely on the classifiers. Based
on the classification rules, the MAC layer selects an appropriate
transport connection for the transmission of the packet. An IPv6
packet is transported over a transport connection that is specifically
established for carrying such packets.

</t>
<t>
Transmission of IPv6 as explained above is possible via multiple
methods, i.e., via IP CS or via Ethernet interfaces. Every Internet
host connected via an 802.16 link:</t>
<t><list style="numbers">
<t> MUST be able to send and receive IPv6 packets via IP CS when the
  MS and BS indicate IPv6 protocol support over IP CS</t>
<t> MUST be able to send and receive IPv6 packets over the Ethernet (802.3)-specific part of the Packet CS when the MS and BS indicate IPv6
  protocol support over Ethernet CS. However, when the MS and BS
  indicate IPv6 protocol support over both IP CS and Ethernet CS, the
  MS and BS MUST use IP CS for sending and receiving IPv6 packets. </t>
</list></t>
<t>
When the MS and BS support IPv6 over IP CS, it MUST be used as the default
mode for transporting IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.16 and the
recommendations in this document that are followed.
Inability to negotiate a common convergence sublayer for IPv6
transport between the MS and BS will result in failure to set up the
transport connection and thereby render the host unable to send and
receive IPv6 packets. In the case of a host that implements more than
one method of transporting IPv6 packets, the default choice of which
method to use (i.e., IPv6 over the IP CS or IPv6 over 802.3) is IPv6
over IP CS when the BS also supports such capability.
</t>

    <t>In any case, the MS and BS MUST negotiate at most one
    convergence sublayer for IPv6 transport on a given link.</t>

    <t>In addition, to ensure interoperability between devices that
    support different encapsulations, it is REQUIRED that BS
    implementations support all standards-track encapsulations
    defined for 802.16 by the IETF. At the time of writing this
    specification, this is the only encapsulation, but additional
    specifications are being worked on. It is, however, not
    required that the BS implementations use all the encapsulations
    they support; some modes of operation may be off by
    configuration.</t>

<section anchor="Encapsulation" title="IPv6 Encapsulation over the IP
				       CS of the MAC">

<t>
The IPv6 payload when carried over the IP-specific part of the Packet
CS is encapsulated by the 6-byte IEEE 802.16 generic MAC header.
The format of the IPv6 packet encapsulated by the generic MAC header
is shown in the figure below. The format of the 6-byte MAC header is
described in the <xref target="802.16"></xref> specification. The CRC
(cyclic redundancy check) is optional. It should be noted that the
actual MAC address is not included in the MAC header.

<t>

For transmission of IPv6 packets via the IP CS over IEEE 802.16, the
IPv6 layer interfaces with the 802.16 MAC
directly. The IPv6 layer delivers the IPv6 packet to the Packet CS of
the IEEE 802.16 MAC.
The Packet CS defines a set of classifiers that are used to determine
how to handle the packet. The IP classifiers that are used at the MAC
operate on the fields of
the IP header and the transport protocol, and these include the IP
Traffic class, Next header field, Masked IP source and destination
addresses, and Protocol source and destination port ranges. Next
header in this case refers to the last header of the IP header
chain. Parsing these classifiers, the MAC maps an upper-layer packet to a
specific service flow and transport connection to be used. The MAC
encapsulates the IPv6 packet in the 6-byte MAC header (MAC SDU) and
transmits it. The figure below shows the operation on the downlink,
i.e., the transmission from the BS to the host. The reverse is
applicable for the uplink transmission.

<section anchor="Arch" title="Generic Network Architecture Using the
			      802.16 Air Interface">

<t>
In a network that utilizes the 802.16 air interface, the host/MS is
attached to an IPv6 access router (AR) in the network. The BS is a
layer 2 entity only. The AR can be an integral part of the BS or the
AR could be an entity beyond the BS within the access network. An AR
may be attached to multiple BSs in a network. IPv6
packets between the MS and BS are carried over a point-to-point
transport connection which is identified by a unique Connection Identifier
(CID). The transport connection is a MAC layer link between the MS and
the BS. The figures below describe the possible network architectures
and are generic in nature. More esoteric architectures are possible
but not considered in the scope of this document.</t>

defines link as a communication facility or medium
over which nodes can communicate at the link layer, i.e.,
the layer immediately below IP.
A link is bounded by routers that decrement the Hop limit field in the
IPv6 header.
When an MS moves within a link, it can keep using its IP addresses.
This is a layer 3 definition, and note that the definition is not identical

and multiple transport connections can exist between an MS and a BS.
</t>

<t>
When an AR and a BS are colocated, the collection of transport
connections to an MS is defined  as a single link.
When an AR and a BS are separated, it is recommended that a tunnel be
established between the AR and a BS whose granularity is no greater
than 'per MS' or 'per service flow' (An MS can have multiple service
flows which are identified by a service flow ID).
Then the tunnel(s) for an MS, in combination with the MS's transport
connections,  forms a single point-to-point link.
</t>
<t>
The collection of service flows (tunnels) to an MS is defined as a single link.
Each link that uses the same higher-layer protocol has only an MS and
an AR. Each MS belongs to a different link. A different prefix should
be assigned to each unique link.  This link is fully consistent with
a standard IP link, without exception, and conforms with the
definition of a point-to-point link in neighbor discovery for
IPv6 <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>.
Hence, the point-to-point link model for IPv6 operation over the IP-specific part of the Packet CS in 802.16 SHOULD be used. A unique IPv6
prefix(es) per link (MS/host) MUST be assigned.

<section anchor="IPvLinkEstablish" title="IPv6 Link Establishment in 802.16">

<t>
In order to enable the sending and receiving of IPv6 packets between
the MS and the AR, the link between the MS and the AR via the BS needs
to be established. This section illustrates the link establishment
procedure.
</t>
<t>
The MS goes through the network entry procedure as specified by
802.16. A high-level description of the network entry procedure is as
follows:
</t>
<t><list style="numbers">
<t>The MS performs initial ranging with the BS. Ranging is a process by
which an MS becomes time aligned with the BS. The MS is synchronized
with the BS at the successful completion of ranging and is ready to
set up a connection.</t>
<t>The MS and BS exchange basic capabilities that are necessary for
  effective communication during the initialization using SBC-REQ/RSP
  (802.16 specific) messages.</t>
<t>The MS progresses to an authentication phase. Authentication is
based on Privacy Key Management version 2 (PKMv2) as defined in the IEEE Std 802.16 specification.</t>
<t>On successful completion of authentication, the MS performs 802.16
registration with the network.</t>
<t>The MS and BS perform capability exchange as per 802.16
  procedures. Protocol support is indicated in this exchange. The CS
capability parameter indicates which classification/PHS options and SDU
encapsulation the MS supports. By default, Packet, IPv4, and 802.3/Ethernet
shall be supported; thus, absence of this parameter in REG-REQ (802.16
message) means that named options are supported by the MS/SS. Support for
IPv6 over the IP-specific part of the Packet CS is indicated by Bit #2 of the
CS capability parameter (refer to <xref target="802.16"></xref>).</t>

<t>The MS MUST request the establishment of a service flow for IPv6
packets over IP CS if the MS and BS have confirmed capability for
supporting IPv6 over IP CS. The service flow
MAY also be triggered by the network as a result of
pre-provisioning. The service flow establishes a link between the MS
and the AR over which IPv6 packets can be sent and received.</t>
<t>The AR and MS SHOULD send router advertisements and solicitations
  as specified in neighbor
  discovery <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>. </t>
</list></t>


<t>
The above flow does not show the actual 802.16 messages that are
used for ranging, capability exchange, or service flow
establishment. Details of these are in <xref target="802.16"></xref>.

<section title="Maximum Transmission Unit in 802.16" anchor="MTU">

<t>
   The MTU value for IPv6 packets on an 802.16 link is configurable.
   The default MTU for IPv6 packets over an 802.16 link SHOULD be 1500
   octets.
</t>

<t>
   The 802.16 MAC PDU  is composed of a 6-byte
   header followed by an optional payload and an optional CRC covering
   the header and the payload.  The length of the PDU is indicated by
   the Len parameter in the Generic MAC header.  The Len parameter has a
   size of 11 bits.  Hence, the total MAC PDU size is 2048 bytes.  The
   IPv6 payload size can vary.  In certain deployment scenarios, the MTU
   value can be greater than the default.  Neighbor discovery for IPv6
   [RFC4861] defines an MTU option that an AR MUST advertise, via router
   advertisement (RA), if a value different from 1500 is used.
   The MN processes this option as defined in <xref target="RFC4861"/>.
   Nodes that implement Path MTU Discovery <xref target="RFC1981"/> MAY use the
   mechanism to determine the MTU for the IPv6 packets.

<section anchor="Prefix" title="IPv6 Prefix Assignment">
<t>
The MS and the AR are connected via a point-to-point connection at the
IPv6 layer.  Hence, each MS can be considered to be on a separate
subnet.  A CPE (Customer Premise Equipment) type of device that
serves multiple IPv6 hosts may be the end point of the connection.
Hence, one or more /64 prefixes SHOULD be assigned to a link.  The
prefixes are advertised with the on-link (L-bit) flag set as
specified in <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>.  The size and number of the
prefixes are a configuration issue.  Also, Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP) or Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)-based prefix
delegation MAY be used to provide one or more prefixes to MS for an AR
connected over  802.16.  The other properties of the prefixes are also
dealt with via configuration.

<section anchor="RtrDisc" title="Router Discovery">
<section anchor="RtrSolicit" title="Router Solicitation">
<t>
On completion of the establishment of the IPv6 link, the MS may send a
router solicitation message to solicit a router advertisement message
from the AR to acquire necessary information as per the neighbor
discovery for IPv6
specification <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>. An MS
that is network attached may also send router solicitations at any
time.
Movement detection at the IP layer of an MS in many cases is based on
receiving periodic router advertisements. An MS may also detect
changes in its attachment via link triggers or other means. The MS can
act on such triggers by sending router solicitations. The router
solicitation is sent over the IPv6 link that has been previously
established. The MS sends router solicitations to the all-routers
multicast address. It is carried over the point-to-point link to the
AR via the BS. The MS does not need to be aware of the link-local
address of the AR in order to send a router solicitation at any
time. The use of router advertisements as a means for movement
detection is not recommended for MNs connected via 802.16 links as the
frequency of periodic router advertisements would have to be high.
</t>
</section><!--end of Rtr Solictation-->

<section anchor="RtrAdvt" title="Router Advertisement">
<t>
The AR SHOULD send a number (configurable value) of router
advertisements to the MS as soon as the IPv6 link is established.
The AR sends unsolicited router advertisements periodically as per
<xref target="RFC4861"></xref>. The interval between
periodic router
advertisements is however greater than the specification in neighbor
discovery for IPv6, and is discussed in the following section.
</t>
</section><!--end of Rtr Advt-->

<section anchor="RtrLife" title="Router Lifetime and Periodic Router Advertisements">
<t>
The router lifetime SHOULD be set to a large value, preferably in
hours. This document overrides the specification for the value of the
router lifetime in "Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6
(IPv6)" <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>.
The AdvDefaultLifetime in the router advertisement MUST be
either zero or between MaxRtrAdvInterval and 43200 seconds. The
default value is 2 * MaxRtrAdvInterval.
</t>
<t>
802.16 hosts have the capability to transition to an idle
mode, in which case, the radio link between the BS and MS is torn down.
Paging is required in case the network needs to deliver packets to
the MS.  In order to avoid waking a mobile that is in idle mode and
consuming resources on the air interface, the interval between
periodic router advertisements SHOULD be set quite high.  The
MaxRtrAdvInterval value specified in this document overrides the
recommendation in "Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6
(IPv6)"<xref target="RFC4861"></xref>.
The MaxRtrAdvInterval MUST be no less than 4 seconds and no greater
than 21600 seconds.
The default value for MaxRtrAdvInterval is 10800 seconds.

<section anchor="Addressing" title="IPv6 Addressing for Hosts">
 <t>
The addressing scheme for IPv6 hosts in 802.16 networks follows the
IETF's recommendation for hosts specified in "IPv6 Node Requirements"
<xref target="RFC4294" />.  The IPv6 node requirements
<xref target="RFC4294" /> specify a set of RFCs that are applicable
for addressing, and the same is applicable for hosts that use 802.16 as
the link layer for transporting IPv6 packets.
 </t>

<section anchor="IID" title="Interface Identifier">
<t>
The MS has a 48-bit globally unique MAC address as specified
in <xref target="802.16">802.16</xref>. This MAC address MUST be used
to generate the modified EUI-64 format-based interface identifier as
specified in "IP Version 6 Addressing
Architecture" <xref target="RFC4291"></xref>. The modified EUI-64
interface identifier is used in stateless address
autoconfiguration. As in other links that support IPv6, EUI-64-based
interface identifiers are not mandatory and other mechanisms, such as
random interface identifiers, "Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address
Autoconfiguration in IPv6" <xref target="RFC4941"></xref>, MAY also be

This document does not introduce any new vulnerabilities to IPv6
specifications or operation. The security of the 802.16 air interface
is the subject of <xref target="802.16"></xref>. It should be noted
that 802.16 provides capability to cipher the traffic carried over the
transport connections. A traffic encryption key (TEK) is generated by
the MS and BS on completion of successful authentication and is used
to secure the traffic over the air interface. An MS may still use IPv6
security mechanisms even in the presence of security over the 802.16
link.
 In addition, the
security issues of the network architecture spanning beyond the 802.16

<abstract><t>IEEE 802.16 is an air interface specification for wireless broadband access. IEEE has specified the service specific convergence sublayers (CS) in the IEEE 802.16 MAC to be used by upper layer protocols. Asynchronous Transfer Mode Convergence Sublayer (ATM CS) and Packet Convergence Sublayer (Packet CS) represent the two main service specific convergence sublayers for the IEEE 802.16. The packet CS is used for transport for all packet-based protocols such as Internet Protocol (IP), IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet) and IEEE 802.1Q (VLAN). The IP specific part of the Packet CS enables transport of IPv4 packets directly over the IEEE 802.16 MAC. This document specifies the frame format, the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) and address assignment procedures for transmitting IPv4 packets over IP Convergence Sublayer (IPCS) of the IEEE 802.16.

<section anchor="WiMAX Arch" title="WiMAX Network Architecture and
				    IPv6 Support">

<t>
The <xref target="WMF">WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave
Access) forum </xref>  has defined a network architecture in which the
air interface is based on the IEEE 802.16 standard. The addressing and
operation of IPv6 described in this document are applicable to the
WiMAX network as well.
</t>
<t>
WiMAX is an example architecture of a network that uses the 802.16
specification for the air interface. WiMAX networks are also in the
process of being deployed in various parts of the world, and the
operation of IPv6 within a WiMAX network is explained in this appendix.
</t>

<t>
The WiMAX network architecture consists of the Access Service Network
(ASN) and the Connectivity Service Network (CSN). The ASN is the
access network that includes the BS and the AR in addition to other
functions such as AAA, mobile IP foreign agent, paging controller,
location register, etc. The ASN is defined as a complete set of
network functions needed to provide radio access to a WiMAX
subscriber. The ASN is the access network to which the MS
attaches. The IPv6 access router is an entity within the
ASN. The term ASN is specific to the WiMAX network architecture. The
CSN is the entity that provides connectivity to the Internet and
includes functions such as mobile IP home agent and AAA. The figure
below shows the WiMAX reference model:

        ]]></artwork> </figure>

<t>
Three different types of ASN realizations called profiles are defined
by the architecture. ASNs of profile types  A and C include BS' and
ASN-gateway(s) (ASN-GW), which are connected to each other via an R6
interface. An ASN of profile type B is one in which the functionality
of the BS and other ASN functions are merged together. No ASN-GW is
specifically defined in a profile B ASN. The absence of the R6
interface is also a profile B specific characteristic.

The MS at the IPv6 layer is associated with the AR in the ASN. The AR
may be a function of the ASN-GW in the case of profiles A and C and is
a function in the ASN in the case of profile B. &nbsp;When the BS and the AR
are separate entities and linked via the R6 interface, IPv6 packets
between the BS and the AR are carried over a Generic Routing
Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel. The granularity of the GRE tunnel should
be on a per-MS basis or on a per-service-flow basis (an MS can have
multiple service flows, each of which is identified uniquely by a
service flow ID).


The protocol stack in WiMAX for IPv6 is shown below:

<t>
As can be seen from the protocol stack description, the IPv6
end-points are constituted in the MS and the AR. The BS provides
lower-layer connectivity for the IPv6 link.

<section anchor="WiMAXLink" title="IPv6 Link in WiMAX">

 <t>
WiMAX is an example of a network based on the IEEE Std 802.16 air
interface. This section describes the IPv6 link in the context of a
WiMAX network. The MS and the AR are connected via a combination of:
</t>
<t><list style="numbers">
<t>The transport connection that is identified by a Connection
    Identifier (CID) over the air interface, i.e., the MS and BS, and</t>
<t>A GRE tunnel between the BS and AR that transports the IPv6
    packets </t>
</list></t>

<t>
From an IPv6 perspective, the MS and the AR are connected by a
point-to-point link.
The combination of transport connection over the air interface and
the GRE tunnel between the BS and AR creates a (point-to-point) tunnel
at the layer below IPv6.
</t>

<t>
The collection of service flows (tunnels) to an MS is defined as a single link.
Each link has only an MS and an AR. Each MS belongs to a different
link.  No two MSs belong to the same link.  A different prefix should
be assigned to each unique link.  This link is fully consistent with
a standard IP link, without exception, and conforms with the
definition of a point-to-point link
in <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>.

<section anchor="WiMAXLinkup" title="IPv6 Link Establishment in WiMAX">

<t>
The mobile station performs initial network entry as specified in
802.16. On successful completion of the network entry
procedure, the ASN gateway/AR triggers the establishment of the initial
service flow (ISF) for IPv6 towards the MS. The ISF is a GRE tunnel
between the ASN-GW/AR and the BS. The BS in turn requests the MS to
establish a transport connection over the air interface. The end
result is a transport connection over the air interface for carrying
IPv6 packets and a GRE tunnel between the BS and AR for relaying the
IPv6 packets. On successful completion of the establishment of the ISF,
IPv6 packets can be sent and received between the MS and AR.

The ISF enables the MS to communicate with the AR for host
configuration procedures. After the establishment of the ISF, the AR
can send a router advertisement to the MS. An MS can establish
multiple service flows with different quality of service (QoS) characteristics. The ISF can
be considered as the primary service flow.
The ASN-GW/AR treats each ISF, along with the other service flows
to the same MS, as a unique link that is managed as a (virtual) interface.

<section title="Maximum Transmission Unit in WiMAX" anchor="WiMAXMTU">
<t>
The <xref target="WMF">WiMAX forum</xref> has specified the Max SDU size
as 1522 octets. Hence, the IPv6 path MTU can be 1500 octets. However,
because of the overhead of the GRE tunnel used to transport IPv6
packets between the BS and AR and the 6-byte MAC header over the air
interface, using a value of 1500 would result in fragmentation of
packets. It is recommended that the MTU for IPv6 be set to
1400 octets in WiMAX networks, and this value (different from the
default) be communicated to the MS. Note that the 1522-octet
specification is a WiMAX forum specification and not the size of the
SDU that can be transmitted over 802.16, which has a higher limit.
