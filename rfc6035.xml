 <t>
This document defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package that enables the collection and reporting of metrics that measure the quality for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) sessions.  Voice call quality information derived from RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP-XR) and call information from SIP is conveyed from a User Agent (UA) in a session, known as a reporter, to a third party, known as a collector. A registration for the application/vq-rtcpxr media type is also included.

<section title="Introduction">
 <t>  
Real-time communications over IP networks use SIP for signaling with RTP/RTCP for media transport and reporting, respectively. These protocols are very flexible and can support an extremely wide spectrum of usage scenarios. For this reason, extensions to these protocols must be specified in the context of a specific usage scenario. In this memo, extensions to SIP are proposed to support the reporting of RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports <xref target="RFC3611" /> metrics.
</t>
<section title="Applicability Statement">
<t>
RTP is utilized in many different architectures and topologies. RFC 5117 <xref target="RFC5117" /> lists and describes the following topologies: point-to-point, point-to-multipoint using multicast, point-to-multipoint using the translator from RFC 3550, point-to-multipoint using the mixer model from RFC 3550, point-to-multipoint using video-switching Multipoint Control Units (MCUs), point-to-multipoint using RTCP-terminating MCU, and non-symmetric mixer/translators. As the Abstract of this document points out, this specification is for reporting quality of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) sessions. As such, only the first topology, point to point, is currently supported by this specification. This reflects both current VoIP deployments, which are predominantly point to point using unicast, and the state of research in the area of quality.
</t><t>
How to accurately report the quality of a multipart conference or a session involving multiple hops through translators and mixers is currently an area of research in the industry. However, this mechanism can easily be used for centrally mixed conference calls, in which each leg of the conferences is just a point-to-point call.  This mechanism could be extended to cover additional RTP topologies in the future once these topics progress out of the realm of research and into actual Internet deployments.

</t>
</section>
<section title="Use of the Mechanism">
<t>
RTCP reports are usually sent to other participating endpoints in a session.
This can make the collection of performance information by an administrator or
management system quite complex to implement. In the usage scenarios
addressed in this memo, the data contained in RTCP XR VoIP metrics reports
(RFC 3611 <xref target="RFC3611" />) are forwarded to a central collection
server systems using SIP.  
</t><t>
Applications residing in the server or elsewhere can aid in network    management to alleviate bandwidth constraints and also to support    customer service by identifying and acknowledging calls of poor    quality. However, specifying such applications is beyond the scope    of this paper. 
</t><t>
There is a large portfolio of quality parameters that can be    associated with VoIP, but only a minimal necessary number of    parameters are included on the RTCP-XR reports: 
</t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>
The codec type, as resulting from the Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer-answer negotiation in SIP, 
</t>
<t>
The burst gap loss density and max gap duration, since voice cut-outs are the most annoying quality impairment in VoIP, 
</t>
<t>
Round-trip delay, because it is critical to conversational quality, 
</t>
<t>
Conversational quality as a catch-all for other voice quality           impairments, such as randomly distributed packet loss, jitter,           annoying silent suppression effects, etc.
</t>
</list>

<t>
  In specific usage scenarios where other parameters are required,    designers can include other parameters beyond the scope of this    paper.
</t><t>

RTCP reports are best effort only, and though they are very useful, they have a    number of limitations as discussed in <xref target="RFC3550" />. This must be considered    when using RTCP reports in managed networks.
</t><t>

This document defines a new SIP event package, vq-rtcpxr, and a new    MIME type, application/vq-rtcpxr, that enable the collection and    reporting of metrics that measure quality for RTP <xref target="RFC3550" /> sessions. The    definitions of the metrics used in the event package are based on    RTCP Extended Reports <xref target="RFC3611" /> and RTCP <xref target="RFC3550" />; a mapping between the SIP    event parameters and the parameters within the aforementioned RFCs    is defined within this document in <xref target="ParamD_M" />.
</t><t>

Monitoring of voice quality is believed to be the highest priority    for usage of this mechanism, and as such, the metrics in the event    package are largely tailored for voice quality measurements. The    event package is designed to be extensible. However, the negotiation    of such extensions is not defined in this document.
</t><t>

The event package supports reporting the voice quality metrics    for both the inbound and outbound directions.  Voice quality metrics for    the inbound direction can generally be computed locally by the    reporting endpoint; however, voice quality metrics for the outbound    direction are computed by the remote endpoint and sent to the    reporting endpoint using the RTCP Extended Reports <xref target="RFC3611" />.
</t><t>

The configuration of the usage of this event package is not covered in this    document. It is the recommendation of this document that the SIP    configuration framework <xref target="SIPPING-CONFIG" /> be used. This is discussed in <xref target="Config_Data" />.
</t><t>
The event package SHOULD be used with the SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY method; however, it MAY also be used with the PUBLISH method <xref target="RFC3903" /> for backward    compatibility with some existing implementations. Message flow    examples for both methods are provided in this document.

</t>

<section title="Terminology">
<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 <xref 
target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
</section>


 <section title="SIP Events for VoIP Quality Reporting">
  <t> 
This document defines a SIP events package <xref target="RFC3265" /> for Voice over IP    performance reporting. A SIP UA can send these events to an entity    that can make the information available to other applications. For    purposes of illustration, the entities involved in SIP vq-rtcpxr    event reporting will be referred to as follows:
</t>
<list style="symbols"> 
<t>
REPORTER: an entity involved in the measurement and reporting of media quality, i.e., the SIP UA involved in a media session.
</t>

<t>COLLECTOR: an entity that receives SIP vq-rtcpxr events. A COLLECTOR may be a proxy server or another entity that is capable of supporting SIP vq-rtcpxr events.
</t>
</list>
<section title="SUBSCRIBE NOTIFY Method">
<t>
The COLLECTOR SHALL send a SUBSCRIBE to the REPORTER to explicitly establish the relationship. The REPORTER SHOULD send the voice quality metric reports using the NOTIFY method. The REPORTER MUST NOT send any vq-rtcpxr events if a COLLECTOR address has not been configured.
The REPORTER populates the Request-URI according to the rules for an in-dialog request. The COLLECTOR MAY send a SUBSCRIBE to a SIP Proxy acting on behalf of the reporting SIP UAs.

</t>
</section>
<section title="PUBLISH Method">
<t>
A SIP UA that supports this specification MAY also send the service quality metric reports using the PUBLISH method <xref target="RFC3903" />; however, this approach SHOULD NOT be used, in general, on the public Internet.
 The PUBLISH method MAY be supported for backward compatibility with    existing implementations.
</t><t>

The REPORTER MAY therefore populate the Request-URI of the PUBLISH    method with the address of the COLLECTOR. To ensure security of SIP    proxies and the COLLECTOR, the REPORTER MUST be configured with the    address of the COLLECTOR, preferably using the SIP UA configuration    framework <xref target="SIPPING-CONFIG" />, as described in Section 5.8.
</t><t>

It is RECOMMENDED that the REPORTER send an OPTIONS message to the    COLLECTOR to ensure support of the PUBLISH message.

</t>
<t>
<list>
<t>
If PUBLISH is not supported, then the REPORTER can only wait for a
SUBSCRIBE request from the COLLECTOR and then deliver the information in
NOTIFYs.  If a REPORTER sends a PUBLISH to a COLLECTOR that does not support or allow this method, a 501 Not Implemented or a 405 Method Not Allowed response will be received, and the REPORTER will stop publication.

</t>
</list>
</t>

</section>

<section title="Multi-Party and Multi-Segment Calls">
<t>
A voice quality metric report may be sent for each session    terminating at the REPORTER, and it may contain multiple report bodies.    For a multi-party call, the report MAY contain report bodies for the    session between the reporting endpoint and each remote endpoint for    which there was an RTP session during the call.
</t><t>

Multi-party services such as call hold and call transfer can result in the user participating in a series of concatenated sessions, potentially with different choices of codec or sample rate, although these may be perceived by the user as a single call.  A REPORTER MAY send a voice quality metric report at the end of each session or MAY send a single voice quality metric report containing an application/vq-rtcpxr body for each segment of the call.

</t>
</section>

<section title="Overload Avoidance">
<t>
Users of this extension should ensure that they implement general SIP  mechanisms for avoiding overload.  For instance, an overloaded proxy  or COLLECTOR MUST send a 503 Service Unavailable or other 5xx response  with an appropriate Retry-After time specified. REPORTERs MUST act on  these responses and respect the Retry-After time interval. In  addition, future SIP extensions to better handle overload as covered in <xref target="SIPPING-OVERLOAD" /> should be followed as they are standardized.
</t><t>

To avoid overload of SIP Proxies or COLLECTORS, it is important to do  capacity planning and to minimize the number of reports that are sent.
</t><t>

 Approaches to avoiding overload include:
</t>
<list style="letters">
<t>
 
Send only one report at the end of each call.  
</t><t>
Use interval reports only on "problem" calls that are being     closely monitored.
</t><t>

Limit the number of alerts that can be sent to a maximum of one per call.

</t> </list>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Event Package Formal Definition">
<section title="Event Package Name">
<t>
This document defines a SIP Event Package.  SIP Event Packages were originally defined in RFC 3265 <xref target="RFC3265" />.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Event Package Parameters">
<t>
No event package parameters are defined.
</t>
</section>

<section title="SUBSCRIBE Bodies">
<t>
SUBSCRIBE bodies are described by this specification.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Subscribe Duration">
<t>
Subscriptions to this event package MAY range from minutes to weeks.    Subscriptions in hours or days are more typical and are RECOMMENDED.    The default subscription duration for this event package is one hour.

</t>
</section>

<section title="NOTIFY Bodies">
<t>
There are three notify bodies: a Session report, an Interval report, and an Alert report.

</t><t>
  The Session report SHOULD be used for reporting when a voice media
   session terminates, when a media change occurs, such as a codec
   change or a session fork, or when a session terminates due to no media
   packets being received and MUST NOT be used for reporting at
   arbitrary points in time.  This report MUST be used for cumulative
   metric reporting and the report timestamps MUST be from the start of
   a media session to the time at which the report is generated.
</t><t>

The Interval report SHOULD be used for periodic or interval    reporting and MUST NOT be used for reporting of the complete    media session. This report is intended to capture short duration    metric reporting and the report intervals SHOULD be non-overlapping time windows.  
</t><t>

The Alert report MAY be used when voice quality degrades during a    session.  The time window to which an Alert report relates MAY be a short time interval or from the start of the call to the point the alert is generated; this time window SHOULD be selected to provide the most useful information to support problem diagnosis.
</t><t>

Session, Interval, and Alert reports MUST populate the metrics with    values that are measured over the interval explicitly defined by    the "start" and "stop" timestamps.
</t><t>

Voice quality summary reports reference only one codec (payload type). This payload type SHOULD be the main voice payload, not comfort noise or
telephone event payloads.  For applications that consistently and
rapidly switch codecs, the most used codec should be reported.  All
values in the report, such as IP addresses, synchronization source (SSRC), etc.,  represent those
values as received by the REPORTER.  In some scenarios, these may not be
the same on either end of the session -- the COLLECTOR will need logic to
be able to put these sessions together.  The values of parameters such
as sample rate, frame duration, frame octets, packets per second, round-trip delay, etc., depend on the type of report in which they are present.  If
present in a Session or an Interval report, they represent average values over the
  session or interval.  If present in an Alert report, they represent
  instantaneous values.</t>

<t>
  The REPORTER always includes local quality reporting information and
  should, if possible, share remote quality reporting information to
  the COLLECTOR.  This remote quality could be available from received
RTCP-XR reports or other
sources.  Reporting this is useful in cases where the other end might
support RTCP-XR but not this voice quality reporting.
</t>

<t>
This specification defines a new MIME type, application/vq-rtcpxr, which is a
text encoding of the RTCP and RTCP-XR statistics with some additional metrics
and correlation information.</t>

</section>

<section title="Voice Quality Event and Semantics">
<t>
This section describes the syntax extensions required for event    publication in SIP. The formal syntax definitions described in this    section are expressed in the Augmented BNF <xref target="RFC5234" /> format used in SIP    <xref target="RFC3261" /> and contain references to elements defined therein.
</t><t>
Additionally, the definition of the timestamp format is provided in    <xref target="RFC3339" />. Note that most of the parameters are optional. In practice, most    implementations will send a subset of the parameters. It is not the    intention of this document to define what parameters may or may not    be useful for monitoring the quality of a voice session, but to    enable reporting of voice quality.  As such, the syntax allows the    implementer to choose which metrics are most appropriate for their    solution.  As there are no "invalid", "unknown", or "not applicable"    values in the syntax, the intention is to exclude any parameters for    which values are not available, not applicable, or unknown.
</t><t>
The authors recognize that implementers may need to add new parameter lines to the reports and new metrics to the existing parameter lines. The extension tokens are intended to fulfill this need.

<section anchor="ParamD_M" title="Parameter Definitions and Mappings">
<!--"-->


<t>
Parameter values, codec types, and other aspects of the endpoints may change dynamically during a session.  The reported values of metrics and configuration parameters SHALL be the current value at the time the report is generated.  
</t><t>
The Packet Loss Rate and Packet Discard Rate parameters are calculated over the period between the starting and ending timestamps for the report.  These are normally calculated from a count of the number of lost or discarded packets divided by the count of the number of packets, and hence are based on the current values of these counters at the time the report was generated.
</t><t>

Packet delay variation, signal level, noise level, and echo level are computed
as running or interval averages, based on the appropriate standard, e.g., RFC
3550 for Packet Delay Variation (PDV), and the sampled value of these running
averages is reported. Delay, packet size, jitter buffer size, and codec-related data may change during a session and the current value of these parameters is reported as sampled at the time the report is generated.

</t>

<section anchor="General" title="General Mapping Percentages from 8-bit, Fixed-Point Numbers">
<t> 
RFC 3611 uses an 8-bit, fixed-point number with the binary point at    the left edge of the field.  This value is calculated by dividing the total number of packets lost by the total number of packets expected and multiplying the result by 256, and then taking the integer part. 
</t><t>
For any RTCP XR parameter in this format, to map into the equivalent SIP vq-rtcpxr parameter, simply reverse the equation, i.e., divide by 256 and take the integer part. 
</t>
</section> 

<section title="Timestamps">
<t>
Following SIP and other IETF conventions, timestamps are provided in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) using the ABNF format provided in RFC 3339 <xref target="RFC3339" />. These timestamps SHOULD reflect, as closely as possible, the actual time during which the media session was running to enable correlation to related events occurring in the network and to accounting or billing records.     

</t>
</section>

<section title="SessionDescription">
<t>
The parameters in this field provide a shortened version of the    session SDP(s), containing only the relevant parameters for session quality reporting purposes. Where values may change during a session, for example, a codec may change rate, then the most-recent value of the parameter is reported.
</t>

</t>
</section>
<section title="Payload Desc">
<t>  
This parameter is a text description of the codec.  This parameter SHOULD use the IANA registry for media-type names where it unambiguously defines the codec.  Refer to the "Audio Media Types" registry on http://www.iana.org.

</t>
</section>
<section title="Frame Octets">
<t>   
This parameter is not contained in RTP or SDP but is usually provided by the device codec. The field provides the number of octets in each frame within the RTP payload.

<t> 
It is the suggestion of the authors that the SIP configuration framework <xref target="SIPPING-CONFIG" /> be used to establish the necessary parameters for    usage of vq-rtcpxr events.  A dataset for this purpose should be    designed and documented in a separate document upon completion of     the framework.

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
RTCP reports can contain sensitive information since they can provide    information about the nature and duration of a session established    between two or more endpoints.  As a result, any third party wishing    to obtain this information SHOULD be properly authenticated by the    SIP UA using standard SIP mechanisms and according to the  recommendations in <xref target="RFC3265" />. Additionally, the event content MAY be    encrypted to ensure confidentiality; the mechanisms for providing    confidentiality are detailed in <xref target="RFC3261" />.
