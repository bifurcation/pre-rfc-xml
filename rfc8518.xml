    <abstract>
      <t> Deployment experience gained from implementing algorithms to determine 
	  Loop-Free Alternates (LFAs) for multi-homed prefixes (MHPs) has revealed some avenues 
	  for potential improvement. This document provides explicit inequalities 
	  that can be used to evaluate neighbors as potential alternates for
	  MHPs. It also provides 
          detailed criteria for evaluating potential alternates for external prefixes 
	  advertised by OSPF ASBRs. 
   This document updates Section 6 of RFC 5286 by expanding some of the
   routing aspects.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t> A framework for the development of IP Fast Reroute (FRR) mechanisms is detailed in <xref target="RFC5714"></xref>. The use of LFAs for IP FRR is specified in 
	      <xref target="RFC5286"></xref>. If a prefix is advertised by more than one router, that prefix is called a "multi-homed prefix (MHP)". MHPs generally occur
   for prefixes obtained from outside the routing domain by multiple
   routers, for subnets on links where the subnet is announced from
   multiple ends of the link, and for prefixes advertised by multiple
   routers to provide resiliency. </t>   
	      
	      <t> Section 6.1 of <xref target="RFC5286"></xref> describes a method to 
	      determine LFAs for MHPs. This document describes 
      a procedure using explicit inequalities that can be used by a computing router to evaluate 
      a neighbor as a potential alternate for an MHP.  The results obtained are 
      equivalent to those obtained using the method described in Section 6.1 of <xref target="RFC5286"></xref>. 
      </t>

      <t>Section 6.3 of <xref target="RFC5286"></xref> discusses complications associated with computing LFAs for 
     MHPs in OSPF.  This document provides detailed criteria for evaluating 
      potential alternates for external prefixes advertised by OSPF ASBRs, as well as explicit 
      inequalities.</t>
      
      <t>This document also provides clarifications and additional
      considerations to 
	 <xref target="RFC5286"></xref> to address a few coverage and operational observations. 



	 These observations are concerned with 1) the IS-IS ATT (attach)
	 bit in the Level 1 (L1) area, 2) links provisioned with MAX_METRIC
	 (see <xref target="IGP_MAX_METRIC"> </xref>) for traffic engineering
	 (TE) purposes, and 3) multi-topology (MT) IGP deployments. These
	 are elaborated in detail in Sections <xref target="ATT_BIT" format="counter"> </xref> and <xref
	 target="LFA_minor_extensions" format="counter"> </xref>.</t> 

 <t> This specification uses the same terminology introduced in  <xref
 target="RFC5714"></xref> to represent LFA and builds on the notation for inequalities
	 used in  <xref target="RFC5286"></xref> to compute LFAs for MHPs. </t>

      <t>
  To compute a valid LFA for a given MHP P, a computing router S MUST, for
  each alternate neighbor N, follow one of the appropriate procedures below  
  once for each remote node that originated the prefix P.
</t>

        <t>Else, N is not an LFA for prefix P.</t>

     </t>
</list>
</t>

<t>Node-Protecting LFAs:

     <t>If, in addition to being an alternate neighbor, N is also a prefix originator of P, 
<list style="letters">
        <t>Select N as an LFA for prefix P (irrespective of the metric advertised by N for the prefix P).</t>

     <t>Else, evaluate the appropriate node-protecting LFA inequality 
        for P with N as the alternate neighbor. 
<list style="letters">

      <t>  If an alternate neighbor N is also one of the prefix originators
of prefix P, it is guaranteed that N will
not loop back packets destined for prefix P to computing router S.
Therefore, N MUST be chosen as a valid LFA for prefix P without evaluating any of 
      the inequalities in <xref target="LFA_INE_MHPS"/> as long as a downstream-paths-only 
      LFA is not desired. To ensure such a neighbor N also provides a downstream-paths-only LFA, 
      router S MUST also evaluate the downstream-paths-only LFA inequality specified in 
      <xref target="LFA_INE_MHPS"/> for neighbor N and ensure router N satisfies the inequality.</t>


      <t>However, if N is not a prefix originator of P, the computing router
      MUST evaluate one of the 
      corresponding LFA inequalities defined in <xref target="LFA_INE_MHPS"/> once for 
      each remote node that originated the prefix. If the inequality is satisfied by the neighbor 
      N, router S MUST choose neighbor N as one of the valid LFAs for the prefix P.</t>

	<section anchor="ISIS_MHPs" title="Improved Coverage with Simplified Approach to MHPs">
	<t>
	Section 6.1 of the LFA base specification <xref
	target="RFC5286"></xref> recommends that a router computes the
	alternate next hop for an IGP MHP by 
	considering alternate paths via all routers that have announced that
	prefix. The same has been elaborated with appropriate inequalities in
	the previous section. However, Section 6.1 of <xref target="RFC5286"></xref> also allows for the router to simplify the MHP 
	calculation by assuming that the MHP is solely attached to the router that was its pre-failure optimal point of attachment, at the expense of potentially 
	lower coverage. If an implementation chooses to simplify the MHP calculation by assuming that the MHP is solely attached to the router that was
        its pre-failure optimal point of attachment, the procedure described in this memo can potentially improve coverage for ECMP MHPs without incurring extra computational cost.
        </t>
	<t>
	This document improves the above approach to provide loop-free
	alternatives without any additional cost for ECMP MHPs as described
	in
	the example network presented in <xref target="ECMP_MHPs"/>. The approach specified here
	may also be applicable for handling default routes as explained in
	<xref target="ATT_BIT"> </xref>.

        <t>
        In <xref target="ECMP_MHPs"/>, a prefix P is advertised from both node E and
	node F. With a simplified approach taken as specified in 
	Section 6.1 of <xref target="RFC5286"></xref>, prefix P will get only
	a link-protecting LFA through the neighbor C while a node-protection
	path is available through neighbor A. In this scenario, E and F both
	are pre-failure optimal points of attachment and share the same primary next hop. 

  Hence, an implementation MAY compare the kind of protection A provides to F
  (link and node protection) with the kind of protection C provides to E
  (link protection) and inherit the better alternative to prefix P. In
  this case, the better alternative is A. 
	</t> 

	<t>
	However, in the example network presented in <xref
	target="Different_NH_ECMP_MHPs"/>, prefix P has an ECMP through both
	node E and node F with cost 20. Though it has two pre-failure optimal 
	points of attachment, the primary next hop to each pre-failure optimal point of attachment is different.  In this case, prefix P MUST 
	inherit the corresponding LFAs of each primary next hop calculated for the router advertising the 
	same. In <xref target="Different_NH_ECMP_MHPs"/>, that would be the
	LFA for node E and node F, i.e., node N1 and node N2, respectively.

	In summary, if there are multiple pre-failure points of attachment for
	an MHP, and the primary next hop of an MHP is the same as that of 
	the primary next hop of the router that was the pre-failure optimal point of attachment, an implementation MAY provide a better

          <t>When RFC1583Compatibility is set to "disabled", OSPF <xref target="RFC2328"></xref> defines certain rules of 
          preference to choose the ASBRs. While selecting an alternate ASBR for loop evaluation for LFA, 
          these rules should be applied to ensure that the alternate neighbor does not cause looping.

	  advertising the same prefix, 
          pruning rules as defined in Section 16.4 of <xref

        <section  title="Type 1 and Type 2 Costs">
          <t>If there are multiple ASBRs not pruned via the rules described in <xref target="MULTIPLE_ASBRS"> </xref>, the cost type advertised 
          by the ASBRs is compared. ASBRs advertising type 1 costs are preferred, and the type 2 costs are 
          pruned. If two ASBRs advertise the same type 2 cost, the alternate ASBRs are considered along with 
          their cost to reach the ASBR/forwarding address for evaluation. If
	  the two ASBRs have the same type 2 cost as well as the same cost to reach
	  the ASBR, ECMP FRR is programmed. When there are multiple ASBRs
	  advertising the same type 2 cost for the prefix,
	  primary Autonomous System (AS) external route calculation, as
	  described in Section 16.4.1 of  <xref target="RFC2328"></xref>,
	  selects the route with the lowest type 2 cost. ASBRs advertising
	  a different type 2 cost (higher cost) are not considered for LFA
	  evaluation. 
	  Alternate ASBRs advertising a type 2 cost for the prefix but not
	  chosen as primary due to a higher cost to reach ASBR
	  are considered for LFA evaluation. 

  The inequalities
  for evaluating alternate ASBR for type 1 and type 2 costs are same,
  as the alternate ASBRs with different type 2 costs are pruned and the
  evaluation is based on ASBRS with equal type 2 costs.

	<t>
	In the simple example network in <xref target="MAX_METRIC"/>, all the
	links have a cost of 10 in
	both directions, except for the link between S and N2.  The S-N2 link
	has a cost of 10 in the forward direction, i.e., from S to N2, and a cost of MAX_METRIC (0xffffff /2^24 - 1 for IS-IS and 0xffff for 
	OSPF) in the reverse direction, i.e., from N2 to S for a specific
	end-to-end TE requirement of the operator. At
	node S, D1 is reachable through N1 with a cost of 20, and D2 is reachable 
	through N2 with a cost of 20. Even though neighbor N2 satisfies the basic loop-free condition (inequality 1 of <xref target="RFC5286"></xref>) for D1,  S's neighbor N2 could be 
	excluded as a potential alternative because of the current exclusions
	specified in Sections 3.5 and 3.6 of <xref
	target="RFC5286"></xref>.

  But, the primary traffic destined to D2
  continues to use the link; hence, irrespective of the reverse metric in
  this case, the same link MAY be used as a potential LFA for D1.
        </t>
	<t>
	Alternatively, the reverse metric of the link MAY be configured with
	MAX_METRIC-1 so that the link can be used as an alternative while
	meeting the operator's TE requirements and without having to update
	the router to fix this particular issue.

	<section anchor="IGP_MT" title="MT Considerations">
	<t>
	Sections 6.2 and 6.3.2 of <xref target="RFC5286"></xref> state that
	multi-topology OSPF and IS-IS are out of scope for that specification.
        This memo clarifies and describes the applicability.
        </t>

	<t>
	In multi-topology IGP deployments, for each MT-ID, a separate
	shortest path tree (SPT) is built with topology-specific adjacencies
	so the LFA principles laid out in <xref target="RFC5286"></xref> are
	actually applicable for MT IS-IS <xref target="RFC5120"></xref> LFA
	SPF. The primary difference in this case is identifying the
	eligible set of neighbors for each LFA computation; this is done per
	MT-ID. The eligible set for each MT-ID is determined 
	by the presence  of IGP adjacency 
	from the source to the neighboring node on that MT-ID apart from the administrative restrictions and other checks laid out in  
	<xref target="RFC5286"></xref>.   The same is also applicable for MT-OSPF <xref target="RFC4915"></xref> or different AFs in  
	multi-instance OSPFv3 <xref target="RFC5838"></xref>.
        </t>

	<t>
	However, for MT IS-IS, if a "standard unicast topology" is used with MT-ID #0
	<xref target="RFC5120"></xref> and both IPv4  <xref target="RFC5305"></xref> 
	and IPv6 routes/AFs  <xref target="RFC5308"></xref>  are present, then
	the condition of network congruency is applicable  for LFA computation
	as well.
	Network congruency here refers to having the same address families
	provisioned on all the links and all the nodes of the network with
	MT-ID #0. 
	Here, with a single-decision process, both IPv4 and IPv6 next hops are computed for all the prefixes in the network. Similarly, with one LFA 
	computation from all eligible neighbors per <xref target="RFC5286"></xref>, all potential alternatives can be computed.
