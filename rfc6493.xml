  <abstract>
    <t>In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), resource
      certificates completely obscure names or any other information
      that might be useful for contacting responsible parties to deal
      with issues of certificate expiration, maintenance, roll-overs,
      compromises, etc.  This document describes the RPKI Ghostbusters
      Record containing human contact information that may be verified
      (indirectly) by a Certification Authority (CA) certificate.  The data in the record are
      those of a severely profiled vCard.</t>
    </abstract>

  <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
    <t>In the operational use of the RPKI, it can become necessary to
      contact, human to human, the party responsible for a
      resource-holding CA certificate, AKA the certificate's maintainer,
      be it the holder of the certificate's private key or an
      administrative person in the organization, a NOC, etc.  An
      important example is when the operator of a prefix described by a
      Route Origin Authorization (ROA) sees a problem, or an impending
      problem, with a certificate or Certificate Revocation List (CRL) in the path between the ROA and
      a trust anchor.  For example, a certificate along that path has expired,
      is soon to expire, or a CRL associated with a CA along the path is
      stale, thus placing the quality of the routing of the address
      space described by the ROA in jeopardy.</t>
    <t>As the names in RPKI certificates are not meaningful to humans,
      see <xref target="RFC6484"/>, there is no way to use a
      certificate itself to lead to the worrisome certificate's or CRL's
      maintainer.  So, "Who you gonna call?"</t>
    <t>This document specifies the RPKI Ghostbusters Record, an object
      verified via an end-entity (EE) certificate, issued under a CA
      certificate, the maintainer of which may be contacted using the
      payload information in the Ghostbusters Record.</t>
    <t>The Ghostbusters Record conforms to the syntax defined in
      <xref target="RFC6488"/>.  The payload of this
      signed object is a severely profiled vCard.</t>
    <t>Note that the Ghostbusters Record is not an identity certificate,
      but rather an attestation to the contact data made by the
      maintainer of the CA certificate issuing the EE certificate whose
      corresponding private key signs the Ghostbusters Record.</t>
    <t>This record is not meant to supplant or be used as resource
      registry whois data.  It gives information about an RPKI
      CA certificate maintainer, not a resource holder.</t>
    <t>The Ghostbusters Record is optional; CA certificates in the RPKI
      can have zero or more associated Ghostbuster Records.
</t>
    <t>Given a certificate, to find the closest Ghostbuster Record, go
      up until a CA certificate is reached, which may be the object
      itself of course.  That CA certificate will have Subject Information
Access (SIA) to the
      publication point where all subsidiary objects (until you hit a
      down-chain CA certificate's signed objects) are published.  The
      publication point will contain zero or more Ghostbuster
      Records.</t>
    <t>This specification has three main sections.  The first,
      <xref target="vprofile"/>, is the format of the contact payload
      information, a severely profiled vCard.  The second,
      <xref target="cms"/>, profiles the packaging of the payload as a
      profile of the RPKI Signed Object Template specification
      <xref target="RFC6488"/>.  The third,
      <xref target="validation"/>, describes the proper validation of
      the signed Ghostbusters Record.</t>

  <section anchor="example" title="RPKI Ghostbusters Record Payload Example">
    <t>An example of an RPKI Ghostbusters Record payload with all properties
      populated is as follows:</t>

    </section>

  <section anchor="vprofile" title="vCard Profile">
    <t>The goal in profiling the vCard is not to include as much
      information as possible, but rather to include as few properties as
      possible while providing the minimal necessary data to enable one
      to contact the maintainer of the RPKI data that threatens the
      ROA[s] of concern.</t>
    <t>The Ghostbusters vCard payload is a minimalist subset of the
      vCard as described in <xref target="RFC6350"/>.
      <list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="BEGIN -">pro forma packaging that MUST be the first
	  line in the vCard and MUST have the value "BEGIN:VCARD" as
	  described in <xref target="RFC6350"/>.</t>
        <t hangText="VERSION -">pro forma packaging that MUST be the
	  second line in the vCard and MUST have the value "VERSION:4.0"
	  as described in Section 3.7.9 of <xref target="RFC6350"/>.
</t>
        <t hangText="FN -">the name, as described in Section 6.2.1 of
	  <xref target="RFC6350"/>, of a contactable person or role who
	  is responsible for the CA certificate.</t>
        <t hangText="ORG -">an organization as described in Section 6.6.4 of
	  <xref target="RFC6350"/>.</t>
        <t hangText="ADR -">a postal address as described in Section 6.3 of
	  <xref target="RFC6350"/>.</t>
        <t hangText="TEL -">a voice and/or fax phone as described in
          Section 6.4.1 of <xref target="RFC6350"/>.</t>
        <t hangText="EMAIL -">an Email address as described in Section 6.4.2 of
	  <xref target="RFC6350"/></t>
        <t hangText="END -">pro forma packaging that MUST be the last
	  line in the vCard and MUST have the value "END:VCARD" as
	  described in <xref target="RFC6350"/>.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Per <xref target="RFC6350"/>, the BEGIN, VERSION, FN, and
        END properties MUST be included in a record.  To be useful, at least
one of ADR, TEL, and EMAIL MUST be included.  Other
        properties MUST NOT be included.</t>
    </section>

  <section anchor="cms" title="CMS Packaging">
    <t>The Ghostbusters Record is a CMS signed-data object conforming to
      the "Signed Object Template for the Resource Public Key
      Infrastructure (RPKI)", <xref target="RFC6488"/>.</t>
    <t>The content-type of a Ghostbusters Record is defined as
      id-ct-rpkiGhostbusters, and has the numerical value of
      1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.35.  This OID MUST appear both within the
      eContentType in the encapContentInfo object as well as the
      content-type signed attribute in the signerInfo object.  See
      <xref target="RFC6488"/>.</t>
    <t>eContent: The content of a Ghostbusters Record is described
      in <xref target="vprofile"/>.</t>
    <t>Similarly to a ROA, a Ghostbusters Record is verified using an
      EE certificate issued by the resource-holding CA certificate whose
      maintainer is described in the vCard.</t>
    <t>The EE certificate used to verify the Ghostbusters Record is the
      one that appears in the CMS data structure that contains the
      payload defined above.</t>
    <t>This EE certificate MUST describe its Internet Number Resources
      using the "inherit" attribute, rather than explicit description
      of a resource set; see <xref target="RFC3779"/>.</t>
    </section>

  <section anchor="validation" title="Validation">
    <t>The validation procedure defined in Section 3 of
      <xref target="RFC6488"/> is applied to a
      Ghostbusters Record.  After this procedure has been performed, the
      Version number type within the payload is checked, and the OCTET
      STRING containing the vCard data is extracted. These data are
      checked against the profile defined in <xref target="vprofile"/>
      of this document.  Only if all of these checks pass is the
      Ghostbusters payload deemed valid and made available to the
      application that requested the payload.</t>
    </section>

  <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
    <t>Though there is no on-the-wire protocol in this specification,
      there are attacks that could abuse the data described.  As the
      data, to be useful, need to be public, little can be done to
      avoid this exposure.
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Phone Numbers:">
        The vCards may contain real world telephone numbers, which could
        be abused for telemarketing, abusive calls, etc.</t>
      <t hangText="Email Addresses:">
        The vCards may contain Email addresses, which could be abused for
        purposes of spam.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    <t>Relying parties are hereby warned that the data in a Ghostbusters
      Record are self-asserted.  These data have not been verified by
      the CA that issued the CA certificate to the entity that issued
      the EE certificate used to validate the Ghostbusters Record.</t>

<abstract><t>This document describes an architecture for an infrastructure to support improved security of Internet routing. The foundation of this architecture is a resource public key infrastructure (RPKI) that represents the allocation hierarchy of IP address space and Autonomous System (AS) Numbers; and a distributed repository system for storing and disseminating the data objects that comprise the RPKI, as well as other signed objects necessary for improved routing security. As an initial application of this architecture, the document describes how a legitimate holder of IP address space can explicitly and verifiably authorize one or more ASes to originate routes to that address space. Such verifiable authorizations could be used, for example, to more securely construct BGP route filters.</t></abstract>
