	<t>
  This document registers with IANA two new DNS SRV protocol labels for
  resolving Instant Messaging and Presence services with SIP.
	</t>
        </abstract>

	<section title="Introduction">
	<t>
The Service Record (SRV) <xref target="RFC2782"/> identifies the host(s) that will support particular services. 
The DNS is queried for SRV RR in the general form:
	</t><t>
_Service._Proto.Name
	</t>

<list style="empty">

<t> Service: the symbolic name of the desired service</t>
<t> Proto: the protocol of the desired service</t>
<t> Name: the domain name for which this record is valid</t>
</list>

	<t>
"Address Resolution for Instant Messaging and Presence"
<xref target="RFC3861"/> provides guidance for locating the services
associated with URIs that employ the following two URI schemes
<xref target="RFC3986"/>: 'im' for INSTANT INBOXes
<xref target="RFC3860"/> and 'pres' for PRESENTITIES
<xref target="RFC3859"/>.


	</t><t>
In order to ensure that the association between "_im" and "_pres" and
their respective underlying services are deterministic, 
the IANA has created two independent registries: the Instant Messaging
SRV Protocol Label registry and the Presence SRV Protocol Label
registry.
	</t><t>
This document defines and registers the "_sip" protocol label in both
registries so that computer programs can resolve 'im:' and 'pres:'
URIs down to SIP addresses.

	</t><t>
Moreover, this document explains how the use of SIP for Presence and
Instant Messaging uses SRV.

<section title="Terminology">
<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
</section>


<section title="DNS SRV Usage of SIP with 'im' and 'pres' URIs">
<t>
Although there are standard procedures for resolving 'im' and 'pres' URIs
(Section 3 of <xref target="RFC3861"/>), the labels for SIP are not
registered. 

</t><t>
Section 5 of <xref target="RFC3428"/> states that if a user agent (UA) is presented
with an IM URI (e.g., "im:fred@example.com")  as the address for an
instant message, it SHOULD resolve it to a SIP URI, and place the
resulting URI in the Request-URI of the MESSAGE request before
sending.

</t><t>
Following the procedures defined in <xref target="RFC3861"/>, in order
to resolve the IM URI, the UA performs a SRV lookup for:

</t><t>
_im._sip.example.com
</t>
<t>
Assuming that the example.com domain offers a SIP service for instant
messaging at simple.example.com, this will result in a resolution of
_im._sip.example.com. to simple.example.com. Thus, the instant
messaging URI im:fred@example.com would resolve to a SIP URI of
sip:fred@simple.example.com.</t>

<t>
SIP supports both pager <xref target="RFC3428"/> and session <xref target="RFC4975"/> IM mode. However, a



DNS SRV lookup does not specify which SIP IM mode a domain offer. If
the user agent client (UAC) supports both session mode and pager mode,
it is then suggested to try session mode first; if that mode is
rejected, the UAC has to be ready to fall back to pager mode.

</t><t>
Section 5 of <xref target="RFC3856"/> states that procedures defined
in <xref target="RFC3861"/> are also used to resolve the
protocol-independent PRES URI for a presentity
(e.g., "pres:fred@example.com") into a SIP URI.

</t><t>
Following the procedures defined in <xref target="RFC3861"/>, in order
to resolve the PRES URI, the UA performs a SRV lookup for:

</t><t>
_pres._sip.example.com

</t>
<t>
Assuming that the example.com domain offers a SIP presence service at
simple.example.com, this will result in a resolution of
_pres._sip.example.com. to simple.example.com. Thus, the
protocol-independent PRES URI pres:fred@example.com would resolve to a
SIP URI of sip:fred@simple.example.com.</t>

<section title="Security Considerations">
		<t>
This document merely serves for the registration of DNS SRV labels in
the appropriate IANA registry. The document does not specify a
protocol; therefore, there are no security issues associated with it. 

</t>
</section>


<section title="IANA Considerations">
	<t>
This specification registers a new SRV protocol label in both the
Instant Messaging SRV Protocol Label registry and the Presence SRV
Protocol Label registry. 
	</t>


<section title="Instant Messaging SRV Protocol Label Registration">
<t>
"Address Resolution for Instant Messaging and
Presence" <xref target="RFC3861"/> defines an Instant Messaging SRV
Protocol Label registry for protocols that can provide services that
conform to the "_im" SRV Service label. Because SIP is one such
protocol, IANA registers the "_sip" protocol label in the "Instant
Messaging SRV Protocol Label Registry", as follows:</t>

<t><list style='hanging' hangIndent='14'>
<t hangText='Protocol label:'>_sip</t>
<t hangText='Specification:'>RFC 5509</t>
<t hangText='Description:'>Instant messaging protocol label for the
use of SIP for Presence and Instant Messaging protocol as defined by
<xref target="RFC3428"/>.



</t>

</list></t>
</section>

<section title="Presence SRV Protocol Label Registration">
<t>
   "Address Resolution for Instant Messaging and Presence" <xref target="RFC3861"/>
   defines a Presence SRV Protocol Label registry for protocols that can
   provide services that conform to the "_pres" SRV Service label.
   Because the use of SIP for Presence and Instant Messaging is one such
   protocol, the IANA registers the "_sip" protocol label in the
   "Presence SRV Protocol Label Registry", as follows: 



</t>
<t><list style='hanging' hangIndent='14'>
<t hangText='Protocol label:'>_sip</t>
<t hangText='Specification:'>RFC 5509</t>
<t hangText='Description:'>Presence protocol label for the use of SIP
for Presence and Instant Messaging protocol as defined by <xref
target="RFC3856"/>.
