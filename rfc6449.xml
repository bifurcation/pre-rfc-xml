		<abstract>
			<t> Complaint Feedback Loops similar to those described herein have existed for more 
				than a decade, resulting in many de facto standards and best practices. This 
				document is an attempt to codify, and thus clarify, the ways that both providers 
				and consumers of these feedback mechanisms intend to use the feedback, 
				describing some already common industry practices. </t>
				
			<t> This document is the result of cooperative efforts within the
        Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group, a trade organization
        separate from the IETF.  The original MAAWG document upon which
        this document is based was published in April, 2010.  This
        document does not represent the consensus of the IETF;
        rather it is being published as an Informational RFC to make it
        widely available to the Internet community and simplify
        reference to this material from IETF work. </t>

		<section anchor="overview" title="Overview" toc="include">
			<t> The intent of a Complaint Feedback Loop is to provide Feedback Consumers with 
				information necessary to mitigate Spam or the perception of Spam. Thus, 
				feedback was originally only offered to mailbox, access, and network 
				providers -- in other words, to ISPs -- who would use the feedback to identify 
				network compromises and fraudulent accounts or to notify their downstream 
				customer that there may be a problem. </t>
			
			<t> Senders of bulk, transactional, social, or other types of email can also use 
				this feedback to adjust their mailing practices, using Spam Complaints as 
				an indicator of whether the Recipient wishes to continue receiving email. 
				Common reactions often include refining opt-in practices, mailing frequency, 
				list management, message content, and other measures. Over time, this has 
				become the Feedback Consumer use case most often discussed at MAAWG 
				meetings and other industry events -- but readers are cautioned that it is 
				not the sole use for feedback. </t>

			<t> When an End User of a Mailbox Provider issues a Spam Complaint, the 
				Feedback Provider sends a report to the Feedback Consumer. This report 
				may include the Full Body of the original email or (less commonly) only 
				the full header of the original email. Some Feedback Providers will redact 
				information deemed private, such as the Message Recipient's Email Address. </t>
			
			<t> Ensuring that Feedback Messages are only sent to authorized Feedback 
				Consumers is the responsibility of the Feedback Provider, with the identity 
				of each message Sender generally determined from the SMTP session's 
				connecting IP address or a message's DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) signature domain, both of which 
				are hard to forge. This is important because Spammers and other miscreants 
				may also attempt to apply for Feedback Loops on networks not belonging to 
				them, in an attempt to steal Email Addresses and other private personal or 
				corporate information. </t>
			
			<t> It is the responsibility of the Feedback Consumer to identify the source 
				and nature of the original message in the reports they receive and take 
				any appropriate action. The Feedback Provider does not make any claims or 
				judgments about the validity of the complaint, beyond whatever technical 
				data the Feedback Provider has themselves included. Every complaint is 
				forwarded to the Feedback Consumer without human review, without any 
				additional application of filters; thus, some individual reports may 
				prove not to be actionable. </t>
			
			<t> The Feedback Consumer and the Feedback Provider will each evaluate a Spam 
				Complaint for validity and take whatever action deemed necessary from 
				their own perspective and, in most cases, will not communicate with each 
				other which actions were (or were not) taken. Similarly, it is rare for 
				any party to communicate further with the End User who initiated the 
				complaint. </t>

		<section anchor="glossary" title="Glossary of Standard Terms" toc="include">
			<t> Wherever possible, these terms are derived from <xref target="RFC5598" />. </t>
						
			<t>
				<list style="symbols">
					<t> Abuse Reporting Format - The standard format for Feedback Messages,
						defined in <xref target="appendix1" /> and <xref target="MARF" />. </t>
					
					<t> Access Provider - Any company or organization that provides End Users with 
						access to the Internet. It may or may not be the same entity that the End User 
						uses as a Mailbox Provider. </t>
					
					<t> Application for Feedback Loop - the process, manual or online, by which a 
						prospective Feedback Consumer requests to receive a Feedback Loop from a 
						particular Feedback Provider. </t>
						
					<t> ARF -- See "Abuse Reporting Format". </t>
					
					<t> ARF Report -- See "Feedback Message". </t>
					
					<t> Body - See "Full Body". </t>
					
					<t> Complaint or Complaint Message - See "Feedback Message". </t>
					
					<t> Complaint Feedback Loop - See Overview and Taxonomy section. </t>
					
					<t> Complaint Stream - See "Feedback Stream". </t>
					
					<t> Delivery - See "Message Delivery". </t>
					
					<t> DKIM - DomainKeys Identified Mail, further described in the MAAWG email 
						authentication white paper 
						<xref target="Trust">
						"Trust in Email Begins with Authentication"</xref> and 
						<xref target="DKIM" />. </t>
						
					<t> End User - A customer of a Mailbox Provider or Access Provider. </t>
					
					<t> Envelope Sender - The Email Address included as the argument to the 
						<xref target="SMTP" /> "MAIL" command during transfer of a message. </t>
						
					<t> Email Address - A string of the form user@domain, where the domain 
						(after the @ symbol) is used to determine where to transfer an email 
						message so that it may be delivered to the mailbox specified by the 
						username (before the @ symbol). The precise technical format of an
						Email Address is defined in <xref target="SMTP" />.  Email delivery 
						can be a complex process and is not described further in this 
						document. </t>
						
					<t> Email Service Provider (ESP) - A provider of email sending services; 
						the ESP is often a Message Originator working on behalf of a Message 
						Author. MAAWG uses the term "ESP" solely for this definition and 
						does not refer to a Mailbox Provider for End Users as ESPs. </t>
						
					<t> FBL - The acronym "FBL" (Feedback Loop) is intentionally not used in this document. </t>
					
					<t> Feedback or Feedback Stream - A set (often a continuous stream) of 
						Feedback Messages sent from a single Feedback Provider to a single
						Feedback Consumer. </t>
						
					<t> Feedback Consumer - A Recipient of the Feedback Messages, almost always 
						on behalf of or otherwise associated with the Message Originator. Often 
						the Message Originator and Feedback Consumer are the same entity, but 
						we describe them separately in this document because they are each 
						responsible for different parts of the Complaint Feedback Loop process,
						as demonstrated in the flowchart in the Overview section. </t>
						
					<t> Feedback Loop - See Complaint Feedback Loop. </t>
					
					<t> Feedback Message - A single message, often using the Abuse Reporting 
						Format defined above and outlined in Appendix 1, which is part of a 
						Feedback Stream. </t>
						
					<t> Feedback Provider - The Sender of the Feedback Messages, almost always 
						on behalf of or associated with the Mailbox Provider. Often the 
						Mailbox Provider and Feedback Provider are the same entity, but we 
						describe them separately in this document because they are each 
						responsible for different parts of the Complaint Feedback Loop process. 
						In some instances, the Feedback Provider may be operating solely on 
						behalf of the Message Recipient, without any direct participation from 
						their Mailbox Provider. </t>
					
					<t> Full Body - An email message (the "DATA" portion of the 
						<xref target="SMTP" /> conversation) consists of two parts: the header 
						and the body. The  "Full Body" is simply the entirety of the body of 
						the message, without modification or truncation. Note that images or 
						other so-called "attachments" are actually part of the body, designated 
						in accordance with the <xref target="MIME" /> standard. </t>
						
					<t> Full Header Section - An email message (the "DATA" portion of the 
						<xref target="SMTP" /> conversation) consists of two parts: the header 
						and the body. The header contains multiple header fields, each formatted 
						as "Header-Name: header contents". Although most Mail User Agents (MUAs) only show the 
						basic four header fields (From, To, Date, and Subject), every message 
						includes additional header fields that primarily contain diagnostic 
						information or data intended to assist automatic processing. Often 
						informally called "Full Headers". These fields are fully defined in
						<xref target="RFC5322" /></t>
						
					<t> Header - See "Full Header Section" above. </t>
					
					<t> ISP - Internet Service Provider, usually referred to as either an 
						Access Provider or a Mailbox Provider in this paper. </t>
						
					<t> Mail Abuse Reporting Format (MARF) - See "Abuse Reporting Format" 
						above. </t>
					
					<t> Mailbox Provider - A company or organization that provides email 
						mailbox hosting services for End Users and/or organizations. Many 
						Mailbox Providers are also Access Providers. </t>
						
					<t> Mailing List - A set of Email Addresses that will receive 
						specific messages in accordance with the policies of that particular 
						list. </t>
					
					<t> Message-ID Header Field - One of the diagnostic header fields 
						included in every email message (see "Full Header Section" above) 
						is the Message-ID. Theoretically, it is a unique identifier for that 
						individual message. </t>
					
					<t> Message Delivery - The process of transferring a message from one 
						mail transfer agent (MTA) to another. Once the message has been 
						accepted by the MTA operating on behalf of the Recipient, it is 
						considered to be "delivered" regardless of further processing or 
						filtering that may take place after that point. </t>
					
					<t> Message Originator - The Sender, but not necessarily the author or 
						creator, of a message. </t>
					
					<t> Message Recipient - The person or mailbox that receives a message 
						as final point of delivery. </t>
					
					<t> MIME - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions refers to a set of 
						standards permitting non-plaintext data to be embedded in the 
						body of a message. Concepts such as file attachments and 
						formatted or "rich" text are all accomplished solely through 
						<xref target="MIME" />. </t>
					
					<t> MUA - Mail User Agent; loosely referring to the software used 
						by an End User to access, interact with, or send email messages. </t>
					
					<t> Provider - See "Feedback Provider" above. </t>
					
					<t> Received Header Field - Diagnostic header fields included in an 
						email message (see "Full Header Section" above) that start with 
						"Received:" and document (from bottom to top) the path a message 
						traversed from the originator to its current position. </t>
					
					<t> Recipient - See "Message Recipient" above. </t>
					
					<t> Return-Path - An optional message header field (see "Full Header 
						Section" above) that indicates the Envelope Sender of the message. </t>
					
					<t> Reverse DNS - The <xref target="DNS" /> name of an IP address, called 
						"reverse" because it is the inverse of the more user-visible query 
						that returns the IP address of a DNS name.  Further, a Reverse DNS query
						returns a PTR record rather than an A record. </t>
					
					<t> Sender - see "Message Originator" above. </t>
					
					<t> SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, the mechanism and language 
						for transferring an email message from one place to another as 
						defined in <xref target="SMTP">RFC 5321</xref>. </t>
					
					<t> Spam - For the purposes of this document (and for most Complaint 
						Feedback Loops), "spam" is defined as any message that the 
						Recipient chooses to complain about, regardless of the intent 
						of the message's author or Sender. </t>
					
					<t> Spam Complaint - See "Complaint" above. </t>
					
					<t> Spammer - An entity that knowingly, intentionally sends Spam 
						messages (see "Spam" above). </t>
					
					<t> Terms of Use - A legal document describing how a particular system 
						or service is to be used. </t>
					
					<t> VERP - <xref target="VERP">
						Variable Envelope Return Path</xref>, an informally standardized 
						method for encoding information about the Message Recipient into 
						the return path while delivering a message in order to ensure that 
						any non-delivery notices are processed correctly. </t>

		<section title="Mailbox Providers and Feedback Providers" toc="include">
			<t> In practice, a Mailbox Provider receives complaints from their End Users, and 
				is often also the Feedback Provider for those complaints and is a consumer of 
				feedback from other providers. In this document, we separate the Mailbox 
				Provider and Feedback Provider functions to reduce possible confusion over 
				those cases where they are separate, and we also urge Mailbox Providers to 
				read the "Feedback Consumer" section later in this document. </t>
							
			<section title="Benefits of Providing Feedback" toc="include">
				<t> The decision to provide a Complaint Feedback Loop service should not be 
					taken lightly. The benefits of a Feedback Loop are great, but success 
					depends on a sound plan, organized implementation, and dedication to 
					upkeep. </t>
				
				<t> What are some benefits of providing feedback to fellow Mailbox Providers 
					and Access Providers? Primarily, other industry actors are quickly 
					alerted to Spam outbreaks on their networks. </t>
				
				<t> End Users are becoming more aware of and comfortable with mechanisms to 
					report Spam, and a Feedback Loop does just what it implies; it closes 
					the loop. The End User's complaint makes its way back to the Message 
					Originator (not necessarily the message Sender, who may be a Spammer), 
					allowing the originator to take appropriate action. In this process, the 
					mail system operator is just a messenger, relieved of the responsibility 
					of reviewing and forwarding complaints manually. </t>
				
				<t> Further, because every complaint is sent immediately -- without any 
					review or analysis by the Feedback Provider -- the complaint is received 
					by the Feedback Consumer in near real time. If the Feedback Consumer is 
					paying attention to their Feedback Stream and taking appropriate action 
					on it, the receiving Mailbox Provider receives less Spam, blocks less 
					legitimate mail, and does not have to assign staff to follow up with 
					the originating network. If the Mailbox Provider does not pay attention 
					to its Feedback Stream, and does not take appropriate action, the 
					Feedback Provider may block or otherwise filter the email from that 
					Message Originator, considering the Feedback Messages to be sufficient 
					notice. </t>
				
				<t> What are some benefits of providing Feedback Loops to bulk Feedback 
					Consumers? As Message Recipients become more aware of and comfortable 
					with Spam reporting mechanisms, they often prefer this method over 
					the often-confusing and inconsistent "unsubscribe" or "opt-out" 
					mechanisms provided by most legitimate Message Originators or Senders. </t>
				
				<t> End Users often do not remember what lists they signed up for or are 
					otherwise not confident in the established relationship they may have 
					with a message Sender. As such, they often choose to report messages as 
					Spam to their Mailbox Providers, considering that to be sufficient 
					notification of their desire not to receive such email in the future. </t>
				
				<t> If the Message Originator is paying attention to and taking appropriate 
					action on their Feedback Stream, it will have a happier set of Message 
					Recipients and should receive fewer Spam Complaints (assuming their opt-in 
					processes are sound). If the Message Originator is not paying attention 
					to Feedback and not taking appropriate action, the Mailbox Provider may 
					consider the Feedback Stream sufficient notice that messages from that 
					originator may no longer be accepted in the future. </t>
			</section>
			
			<section anchor="collecting" title="Collecting Complaints" toc="include">
				<t> To produce Feedback Messages and to ensure they are useful, the Feedback 
					Provider needs to obtain near real-time complaints from the Mailbox 
					Provider's users. This is typically done by integrating the feedback
					mechanism with the collection of Spam reports from its users. </t>
					
				<t> These reports are typically made using the "Report Spam" buttons 
					integrated into Webmail interfaces, or a proprietary desktop client 
					provided to users. Mailbox Providers may also look at deploying a 
					toolbar or MUA plug-in that provides a "Report Spam" button in the 
					MUA interface. </t>
					
				<t> Usability studies with average users should be performed on all interface 
					changes before implementation. A "help" interface should also be available 
					to educate users about how the Spam button should be used and what it does. </t>
					
				<t> If the Mailbox Provider does not offer its customers a mail client with 
					this button, then the Feedback Provider's chances for providing an 
					effective Feedback Loop are slim. While it is possible for the Mailbox 
					Provider to instruct its customers to forward unwanted mail to a central 
					location and for the Mailbox Provider to explain how to ensure the report 
					includes headers and bodies, the success rate of customers doing so tends
					to be low. Even those complaints that do contain all required information
					might prove difficult to parse, as variations in formatting and content 
					types will lead to automated tools being consistently updated with new 
					logic blocks for each variation that occurs. </t>				
			</section>
			
			<section anchor="creating" title="Creating Reports" toc="include">
				<t> It is recommended that Feedback Messages be sent using the standard Abuse 
					Reporting Format, to facilitate uniformity and ease of processing for all 
					consumers of feedback. This will also enable the Feedback Provider to 
					extensively automate the processes of generating and sending Feedback 
					Messages and of analyzing complaint statistics. This format is described 
					further in Appendix 1. </t>
					
				<t> Feedback Loops are usually (but not always) keyed to the "last hop" IP 
					address (i.e., the IP address that passed the unwanted message to the 
					Mailbox Provider's servers). Consequently, the Feedback Provider must 
					be able to process the header from each complaint to determine the IP 
					address for the complaint. </t>
					
				<t> A Feedback Provider may wish to provide, as part of its Feedback Loop, other 
					information beyond Spam Complaints that Feedback Consumers may find 
					valuable. It might include summary delivery statistics (volume, inbox 
					delivery rate, Spam trap hits, etc.) or other data that the Feedback 
					Provider may deem pertinent to Feedback Consumers. </t>
					
				<t> Any mature Feedback Loop system will produce situations in which the 
					Feedback Consumer may have follow-up questions or have other information 
					to provide in regard to the feedback. Feedback Messages should include 
					contact information (typically an Email Address) for the Feedback 
					Consumer to use for such questions, and ideally the contact Email 
					Address will feed into a ticket system or other automated tool used by 
					the Mailbox Provider's postmaster and/or anti-abuse staff for handling 
					general email delivery issues. </t>
			</section>
			
			<section anchor="policy" title="Policy Concerns" toc="include">
				<section title="Privacy and Regulatory Compliance">
					<t> Feedback Messages provide information relayed by Feedback Providers 
						from a Mailbox Provider's End Users to the Feedback Consumer. There 
						might not be any concerns with relaying non-private data to a third 
						party. However, the information provided in the complaints generated 
						by the user must be evaluated and any data deemed private may need 
						to be removed before distributing to a third party, per local policy. 
						For example, the Recipient's or reporter's Email Address and IP 
						address may be categorized as private data and removed from the 
						feedback report that is provided to the Feedback Consumer. Privacy 
						laws and corporate data classification standards should be consulted 
						when determining what information should be considered private. </t>
						
					<t> Information provided by the Feedback Consumer to the Feedback Provider 
						for the purpose of enrolling in the Feedback Loop should also be kept 
						private. It should only be shared or used for the purposes explicitly 
						agreed to during the enrollment process (see the "Terms of Use" section below). </t>
						
					<t> Feedback Loops inevitably span country borders. Local laws and regulations 
						regarding distribution of information domestically and internationally 
						need to be considered when implementing a Feedback Loop program. For 
						example, in some European countries, data exchange requires permission 
						from governing bodies. The terms and circumstances surrounding the 
						exchange of data need to be clearly defined and approved. </t>
				</section>
				
				<section title="Terms of Use">
					<t> A written Terms of Use agreement should be provided by the Feedback Provider 
						and agreed to by the Feedback Consumer before any feedback is provided. The 
						following concepts should be considered when drafting the terms of use 
						agreement: </t>
					
					<t>
						<list style="symbols">
							<t> Data provided in Feedback Messages are provided to a specific, 
								approved entity. Information should not be transmitted outside of 
								the intended, approved Recipient. Any inappropriate use of the 
								information can lead to immediate termination from the feedback 
								program. </t>
								
							<t> Consumers of Feedback have a responsibility to keep the information 
								they provide for Feedback Loop purposes -- such as abuse contact 
								information, IP addresses, and other records -- accurate and up to date. </t>
								
							<t> The providing of Feedback information is a privilege and needs to be 
								treated appropriately. It does not entitle the consumer of the 
								feedback to any special sending privileges. </t>
								
							<t> Approval and continued enrollment in the program is a privilege that 
								can be denied or revoked for any reason and at any time. </t>
						</list>
					</t>
				</section>
			</section>
				
			<section anchor="requests" 
			 title="Handling Requests to Receive Feedback" toc="include">
				<t> There should be a streamlined application process for receiving feedback and the 
					vetting of such applications. This vetting may be stringent in cases where the 
					Mailbox Provider chooses to tie its Complaint Feedback Loop program to a 
					whitelist. Criteria may involve the following: </t>
				
				<t>
					<list style="symbols">
						<t> Cross-checking that the requestor is indeed authorized to receive 
							feedback for the IP addresses concerned. </t>
							
						<t> Gathering other information such as whether the IPs are an ISP smarthost 
							network, a webhosting farm, an email marketing or Mailing List service, 
							or other entity. </t>
							
						<t> Requesting information such as a link to the policies of the requestor, 
							contacts to send Feedback Messages, and escalation points of contact. </t>
					</list>
				</t>
				
				<t> Ideally, enrollment will be a two-step process, with the applicant filling out a 
					form and being required to receive and acknowledge a confirmation email (best 
					sent to abuse@ or postmaster@ the domain in question) before the applicant's 
					request is even put into the queue for the Feedback Provider to process. </t>
					
				<t> Ownership of IP addresses can and should be cross-checked by means of origin Autonomous System Number (ASN), 
					WHOIS/RWHOIS records, Reverse DNS of the sending hosts, and other sources. 
					This can be automated to some extent, but it often requires some manual 
					processing. </t>
				
				<section title="Application Web Site">
					<t> Applications for Feedback Loops can be accepted on a stand-alone web site or 
						can be part of the Mailbox Provider's postmaster site. Regardless, the 
						web site for the Complaint Feedback Loop program should contain other content 
						specific to the Feedback Loop, including FAQs for the Feedback Loop program, 
						the Terms of Service for the Feedback Loop, and perhaps a method for 
						enrolled parties to modify their existing enrollments. </t>
						
					<t> The web site should also provide the Feedback Consumer with general information 
						on how the feedback will be sent, including: </t>
					
					<t>
						<list style="symbols">
							<t> Report Format (ARF or otherwise) </t>
							<t> Sending IP addresses and/or DKIM "d=" string </t>
							<t> "From" Email Address </t>
						</list>
					</t>
				</section>
				
				<section title="Saying No">
					<t> Denial of a Feedback Loop application may be appropriate in certain cases
						such as: </t>
					
					<t>
						<list style="symbols">
							<t> Where the Feedback Provider suspects "gaming" of delivery policies via 
								the Feedback received, with attempts to pollute Feedback Loop metrics 
								by, for example, creating bogus accounts and reporting false negatives 
								with these, to offset the negative reputation caused by high complaint 
								rates. </t>
								
							<t> Where the Feedback Provider has decided to block the 
								Message Originator's IP space for which feedback has been requested 
								on the grounds that email from that originator has a sufficiently 
								negative reputation that it will not be delivered at all. This is 
								somewhat on the lines of a global unsubscribe of the Message 
								Provider's users from the originator's lists, which would make 
								rendering additional feedback unnecessary. </t>
						</list>
					</t>
					
					<t> It is recommended that the Feedback Provider send notification if an application 
						is denied. Additionally, they should maintain a documented, clear, and 
						transparent appeals process for denial of requests. This process can be as 
						simple as the prospective Feedback Consumer replying to the denial email 
						requesting review or escalation to a team lead, which also cites reasons 
						the application should be reviewed. </t>
				</section>
				
				<section title="Automation">
					<t> For a Feedback Loop to be cost-effective and usable for large Feedback 
						Consumers and Feedback Providers, it must be possible for reports to be 
						generated and processed automatically without any human interaction. On 
						the other hand, it should be possible for small Feedback Consumers to 
						handle a low volume of reports manually, without requiring any automation. </t>
						
					<t> In automating the feedback process, the consumer of the Feedback Stream must 
						receive enough information about the report that it can take appropriate 
						action, typically to remove the Recipient from the Mailing List about which it is sending 
						a report. The Recipient's Email Address is not enough, as the Recipient 
						may be on several Mailing Lists managed by the Feedback Loop consumer and 
						only need to be removed from the particular list reported. </t>
					
					<t> Also, some producers of Feedback Loops might redact the Recipient's Email 
						Address for privacy reasons. Effective implementation of a Complaint Feedback 
						Loop requires that the Feedback Provider put in place as many automated 
						processes and tools as feasible to handle all aspects of the process. 
						Feedback Providers should seek to automate or script the following: </t>
					
					<t>
						<list style="symbols">
							<t> Accepting and validating Feedback Loop Applications from prospective 
								Feedback Consumers. </t>
								
							<t> Processing requests to determine whether or not they meet the Feedback 
								Provider's criteria for enrollment in the program. </t>
								
							<t> Accepting Spam Complaints from End Users; this will form the bulk (and
								perhaps sole) component of the feedback sent by the Feedback Provider. </t>
								
							<t> Production of Feedback Messages from Spam Complaints. </t>
								
							<t> Production of other Feedback Loop artifacts as chosen by the Feedback
								Provider. </t>
								
							<t> Optionally, provision of a mechanism for Feedback Consumers to further

				<t> It is recommended that self-service maintenance be offered to Feedback Consumers, 
					to the extent practicable. The more they can do themselves, the less you have to 
					do. </t>
				
				<section title="IP Validation">
					<t> The criteria that a Feedback Provider uses to validate a Feedback Loop 
						application may change over time. It is a near certainty at least some 
						subset of Feedback Consumers enrolled to receive feedback will at some 
						point after enrollment fail to meet those criteria, regardless of whether 
						or not the criteria change. </t>
						
					<t> The Feedback Provider should put in place tools to periodically re-validate 
						all Feedback Consumers enrolled in its Feedback Loop system against its 
						current criteria. Additionally, the Feedback Provider will likely have 
						objective criteria for remaining in the Feedback Loop for enrolled Feedback
						Consumers; the enrolled consumers should be validated against those 
						criteria as well. </t>
				</section>
				
				<section title="Email Address Validation">
					<t> Just as some Mailing List software has the built-in ability to send 
						periodic "probe" emails to subscribed addresses to validate them, so too 
						should the Feedback Provider develop tools to send similar emails to the 
						addresses receiving Feedback Messages to ensure that they are valid. This 
						is especially true for the addresses that are not the abuse@ and postmaster@ 
						addresses originally used as part of the enrollment acknowledgment step. 
						Over time, people may change employers, or at least roles, and validating the

						the Feedback Consumer. </t>

		<section title="Feedback Consumers" toc="include">
			<t> A Feedback Consumer receives its Feedback Messages after its submitted Application for 
				a Complaint Feedback Loop is approved. A Feedback Consumer will usually have Complaint
				Feedback Loop subscriptions set up with multiple Feedback Providers. Different 
				Feedback Streams may be in different formats or include different information, and 
				the Feedback Consumer should identify a process to organize the data received and 
				take appropriate action. </t>
				
			<t> A Feedback Consumer, Mailbox Provider, or Access Provider (i.e., a hosting company or ISP)
				will use this Feedback to identify network compromises, fraudulent accounts, policy 
				violations, and other concerns. The Feedback Loop provides real-time visibility into 
				Spam Complaints from Message Recipients, greatly enabling these Mailbox Providers to 
				mitigate Spam propagating from their networks. </t>
				
			<t> Senders of bulk email should use the complaints to make decisions regarding future 
				mailings. Such decisions may include one or more of the following: modification of 
				email frequency, branding, opt-in practices, or list management. </t>
				
			<t> The authors of this document urge those who are solely Feedback Consumers to also 
				read the previous sections for Mailbox Providers and Feedback Providers. This will 
				provide the proper context of the recommendations included below. </t>
				
			<t> Further recommendations for bulk senders may be found in the MAAWG 
				<xref target="MAAWG-BCP">
				Sender Best Communications Practices</xref>. </t>
			
			<section title="Preparation" toc="include">
				<t> Feedback Consumers need to prepare to process and act on feedback before asking to
					receive it. At a minimum, make sure to have: </t>
				
				<t>
					<list style="numbers">
						<t> The "Role" Email Addresses such as abuse@ and postmaster@. The person who 
							applies for the Feedback needs to make sure they have access to these 
							Email Addresses. Feedback Providers often send a confirmation link to 
							those accounts to prevent End Users, Spammers, or competitors from 
							signing up for Feedback for which they are not authorized. </t>
						
						<t> A dedicated Email Address to receive the Feedback Messages, such as 
							fbl@example.com or isp-feedback@example.com. While not required, this 
							will make it easier for to process the reports received. </t>
						
						<t> A list of IP addresses for which you want to receive Feedback Messages, 
							making sure you can prove the ownership of the IP addresses and 
							associated domains. Feedback Providers often require that:
							
							<list style="symbols">
								<t> Reverse DNS for each IP shares the domain of either the 
									applicant's Email Address or the Email Address that will be 
									receiving the Feedback Messages. </t>
								
								<t> WHOIS information for the IPs requested is obviously associated 
									with the domain name. </t>
							</list>
						</t>
						
						<t> Contact information such as name, Email Address,

						<t> The knowledge that if the application form asks for your credit card number or other financial
							information, it is assuredly a scam. </t>
					</list>
				</t>
			</section>
			
			<section title="What You'll Receive" toc="include">
				<t> Once a Feedback Consumer has signed up to receive feedback from a Feedback Provider, 
					it may also receive several other sorts of delivery-related reports. This includes 
					Feedback Messages, administrative messages, and other messages. </t>
				
				<section title="Feedback Reports">
					<t> Feedback Messages are the main emails generally associated with a Feedback Loop. 
						Each time a Recipient hits the "This Is Spam" button, the Feedback Loop system 
						creates a boilerplate report with a copy of the original email attached and 
						sends it to the consumer of the Feedback Loop. </t>
						
					<t> The handling of feedback reports is discussed in the next section. </t>
				</section>
				
				<section title="Administrative Messages">
					<t> Administrative messages will typically be sent to the Email Address provided 
						for contacting the person who originally applied for the Feedback Loop, rather 
						than to the address provided for handling the Feedback Messages. These messages 
						are likely to be sent infrequently and irregularly, but it is important they 
						are seen by the person managing the Feedback Stream processor in a timely 
						manner. It is usually a poor idea to have these sent to an individual's Email 
						Address since they may be lost if that person is on vacation, changes position 
						within the company, or leaves the company. </t>
						
					<t> Instead, they should be sent to a role account that goes to a ticketing system 
						or "exploded" to multiple responsible parties within the organization. If 
						there is not already an appropriate role account such as support@ or noc@ 
						that reaches the right team, it may be a good idea to set up a dedicated 
						alias such as fblmaster@ to sign up for all Feedback Loops. </t>					
				</section>
				
				<section title="Report Cards">
					<t> The detail in a report card can vary greatly. Feedback Providers might send a 
						regular summary of traffic levels and complaint rates seen, perhaps just an 
						overview or possibly broken down by source IP address or some other identifier. 
						Sometimes these may be sent just when some metric (typically a complaint rate) 
						reaches a level that causes the Mailbox Provider to notify the Feedback Consumer 
						there may be a problem developing that needs to be investigated and addressed. 
						At the other extreme, some report cards will contain almost no useful data at 
						all, just a warning that the Message Originator is causing complaints -- with the 
						implication that its email will be blocked unless it is improved. </t>
						
					<t> Report cards are human readable, since there are not currently any standard 
						machine-readable formats and the information they include, both the provided 
						metrics and their semantics, varies widely from one Mailbox Provider to another. 
						They are useful reference overviews for a Message Originator to monitor the 
						overall perceived quality of the email it sends and, in the case of ESPs, 
						perhaps which customers are causing higher than expected rates of complaints. 
						They can also be the only warning of serious problems prior to email being 
						blocked altogether by the receiving Mailbox Provider. It is critical they be 
						are seen by someone handling delivery issues for the Message Originator, so 
						again, they should be handled by an email alias that is always read. </t>
						
					<t> Report cards also contain useful data to track mechanically and perhaps report 
						on trends, though as their content varies, it is hard to generalize what use 
						might be made of them. At the very least, the "warning" report cards are 
						something that should be visible on an ESP's business intelligence or 
						delivery dashboard. </t>
				</section>
			</section>
			
			<section title="Handling Feedback Messages" toc="include">
				<t> Mailbox Providers sending feedback may have published policies as to how they 
					expect a Feedback Consumer to use Feedback Messages or may expect the Feedback 
					Consumer to simply "make the problem stop". In practice, this mostly boils down 
					to three things: </t>
				
				<t>
					<list style="symbols">
						<t> First, where the consumer of the feedback has some specific control over 
							sending the email, it is expected not to send email of the same type to 
							the same Recipient again. </t>
						
						<t> Second, it should identify the underlying problem (if any) and fix it so 
							that it receives fewer reports of that type in the future. </t>
							
						<t> Third, it is not necessary to inform the Mailbox Provider or Feedback Provider,
							or their End User(s), of which actions have been or will be taken in response 
							to automated complaint feedback. </t>
					</list>
				</t>
				
				<t> If the Feedback Consumer is a separate entity from the Message Originator, the two
					entities are expected to work together to resolve any problem. </t>
				
				<section title="Unsubscription or Suppression">
					<t> A Sender (whether author or originator) of commercial email should treat the 
						Feedback Message similar to an unsubscribe request, ensuring that no further
						email from that list is sent to that Recipient, either by removing the email 
						from that list or adding it to the associated suppression list. It needs to use 
						its best judgment, keeping in mind the goal of reducing future complaints, as 
						to how broadly to apply that unsubscribe. Suppressing the address across an 
						entire ESP is likely too broad. However, if a single Feedback Consumer (or customer 
						of an ESP) has multiple segmented lists, then suppressing them across all 
						those lists is probably a good idea. </t>
					
					<t> It is universally acknowledged that not all complaints are intentional; for 
						example, Recipients might accidentally hit the wrong button or mark an entire 
						mailbox as Spam. However, it is best for Feedback Consumers to assume the 
						Recipient does not want more email and to suppress mail to the Recipient in 
						all but fairly extreme cases such as a Mailing List the Recipients pay to 
						receive, email from a genuine company to its valid employees, or email from 
						an Access Provider or Mailbox Provider to its users. </t>
						
					<t> This gets more complex in the case of transactional mail -- mail that is tied to 
						some other service, such as ticket purchase confirmations or billing statements. 
						In that case, the Feedback Consumer has to, again, use its best judgment based 
						on the specific situation. In some cases, the right thing to do may be to 
						communicate with the Recipient via another channel, such as a message on a 
						web site used for the service; i.e., "You reported your notification mail as 
						Spam so we are not going to send you any more messages unless you tell us 
						otherwise". </t>
						
					<t> In some cases, the best thing to do may be to ignore the Feedback Message. For 
						example, if your customer has reported as Spam the airline tickets he purchased 
						and you emailed him, he probably did not mean it and he is going to be very 
						annoyed if you do not send him the other tickets he has ordered. In rare cases, 
						it might be appropriate to suppress email to the Recipient, but also to suspend 
						access to a service he or she uses until the Recipient confirms a desire to 
						receive the associated email. In all these cases, the important goal is to keep 
						the customer happy and reduce future complaints, even in the apparently 
						paradoxical situations where the way to do that is to ignore their Feedback. 
						In the real world, however, these are a small minority of cases. </t>
				</section>
				
				<section title="Trending and Reporting">
					<t> Counting the Feedback Messages received over regular time periods can provide 
						much useful information to ISPs, ESPs, and other Feedback Consumers, especially 
						when broken down appropriately. </t>
						
					<t> An ISP (Mailbox Provider or Access Provider) might want to count the number of 
						Feedback Messages a particular customer or IP address causes in a given day. If 
						there is a sudden increase from a particular customer or server, it may be a 
						sign that a Spammer has signed up or a system has been compromised. If there 
						is a high level of complaints about a particular customer, it may be worth 
						investigating to see if there is a reason for that. For example, 10 Feedback 
						Messages a day would be a sign of serious problems in some cases, but might be 
						perfectly reasonable "background" levels for a Message Originator that sends 
						300,000 emails a month. If the count shows there may be a problem, the ISP 
						can dig down and look at the emails that are being reported to determine the 
						underlying cause. </t>
						
					<t> An ESP can do similar things but can also break the data down in more ways: by 
						customer, by Mailing List, by campaign. An ESP also has access to more information; 
						it knows how many emails were delivered to the receiving Mailbox Provider over a 
						given time period. As a result, it can estimate the number of complaints divided by 
						the number of emails sent, which is often a more useful metric than the absolute 
						number of reports. This is critical data for ESPs to track over time because it can 
						help identify and quantify problem customers. </t>
						
					<t> An individual Feedback Consumer, whether sending their own email or using an ESP, 
						can acquire at least some information from complaint rates. A spike in complaints 
						on an otherwise stable list might be a sign there is a problem with address 
						acquisition, if the spike is due to reports from new subscribers. If it came from 
						older subscribers, it might be attributable to content of a particular mailing that 
						was not well received. Perhaps the branding was not recognized or the content was 
						offensive or inappropriate for the list. </t>
						
					<t> The complaint rate is determined by the number of Feedback Messages received over 
						a given time period divided by the number of emails delivered to the associated 
						Mailbox Provider over the same period. It is an obvious and useful metric to track, 
						but there are a few subtle issues to be aware of. </t>
						
					<t> One issue is that Feedback Messages tend to be counted on the day the complaint was 
						sent, which is the day the original message was read by the Recipient. That may not 
						be the same day that the message was sent. A simple example is the fact that a Message Originator 
						that sends email regularly Monday through Friday will often see a high complaint 
						rate on Saturday. The absolute number of Feedback Messages sent by people catching 
						up with the week's email over the weekend may not be that high. However, since hardly 
						any email is sent on Saturday, a fairly reasonable number of complaints end up 
						being divided by a very small number of total sent emails, possibly even zero, 
						which would break the reporting engine. This can lead to a complaint rate that 
						seems to range anywhere from suspicious to ridiculous. Consequently, large Mailing 
						Lists that are virtually silent on the weekend could end up receiving more 
						complaints on a Saturday than email they sent that day, leading to complaint 
						rates of well over 100%. </t>
						
					<t> Another arithmetic issue to consider is the interaction between the inbox, the 
						bulk folder, and the "This Is Spam" button. If an organization sends a high volume 
						of email that has a terrible reputation, it may end up with perhaps 500 of its 
						10,000 mails in the inbox and the remaining 9,500 in the bulk folder. If it gets 
						10 Feedback Messages and divides that by the 10,000 emails it sent, it will get
						a very respectable 0.1% complaint rate. However, the Mailbox Provider is probably 
						going to calculate the complaint rate by dividing the number of emails delivered 
						to the inbox instead -- giving a 2% complaint rate, which is probably grounds for 
						immediate blocking. So, if one sees a large difference between a complaint rate 
						as reported by a Mailbox Provider or other reputation system and the rate 
						calculated from raw delivery numbers, it is important to look closely at the 
						data. </t>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section title="Automatically Handling an Incoming Feedback Stream"
			 toc="include">
				<t> Even when signing up for a Feedback Loop is partly automated, modifications to it tend 
					to be handled manually. Even something as trivial as changing the Email Address that 
					the Feedback Messages are sent to can be time-consuming and can cause significant 
					overhead to the Feedback Provider. Multiply that by a dozen Feedback Loops, and getting 
					it right the first time can save a lot of time and energy. </t>
					
				<t> Even the smallest of users should create a unique email alias for each Feedback Loop. 
					There are several advantages to this, even if they all deliver to the same person's 
					inbox at first. Sending each Feedback Loop to a unique address makes it immediately 
					clear which Feedback Provider was the source of any given report, even if it is sent 
					from an inconsistent From address. It makes it easy to put lightweight pre-processing 
					in place for a particular Feedback Stream, if needed. It makes it easy to discard 
					Feedback Messages if needed (though only temporarily, as it could be very bad for one's 
					reputation to miss a changing trend).  If a Feedback Consumer needs to scale up, it is 
					easy to point the existing aliases at a Feedback Loop processing engine. </t>
					
				<t> If an organization might possibly scale up appreciably in the future or consider 
					outsourcing its Feedback Loop processing to a third-party Feedback Consumer, it may be 
					even better to create a subdomain for handling Feedback Streams. For example, example.com 
					might use fbl-aol@fbl.example.com to accept its AOL Feedback Loop, allowing it to 
					delegate the whole of @fbl.example.com to a Feedback Loop handling appliance or service, 
					should the need arise. </t>
					
				<t> Small Feedback Consumers, with lists of no more than a few thousand Recipients, or 
					small ISPs with no particular history of problems, should be able to handle feedback 
					reports with little or no automation, as an ARF message should be readable in most mail 
					clients. It may be worthwhile to add some very lightweight processing to the inbound 
					Feedback Messages to make them easier to triage from other email client. For example, 
					<xref target="Wise">arffilter.c</xref>
					can annotate the Subject line of inbound Feedback Messages with the IP 
					address being reported, making it easier to see patterns of problems by sorting the 
					messages by Subject line in the mail client. To identify which Recipient is causing the 
					feedback to be sent, small Feedback Consumers should add some of the automation mentioned 
					below that is intended for larger Feedback Consumers. </t>
					
				<t> Larger Feedback Consumers need to be able to automate the handling of Feedback, as it 
					scales beyond the ability of someone to manage manually quite quickly. The main 
					capability a Feedback Loop processor needs is to extract some relevant data from the 
					report, reliably. The most important bits of data tend to be the following: </t>
				
				<t>
					<list style="symbols">
						<t> The Recipient of the original email </t>
						
						<t> The Mailbox Provider originating sending the Feedback Message 
							(some Feedback Providers operate on behalf of multiple Mailbox
							Providers) </t>
							
						<t> The customer who sent the original email (in the case of an 
							ESP or Mailbox Provider) </t>
							
						<t> The campaign and Mailing List that the original email belonged 
							to, if any </t>
							
						<t> (Possibly) the IP address from which the original email was 
							sent and any <xref target="DKIM" /> signature domain </t>
					</list>
				</t>
				
				<t> The last isn't vital, but may be a useful piece of data in diagnosing
					delivery problems. </t>

				<t> It can be very difficult to extract some of this data without some upfront work before 
					email is sent. Some Feedback Providers will redact the Email Address in the To: header or 
					Recipient Email Addresses anywhere within the message. Some will delete any identifying 
					information they can. It may be possible to identify the End User based on the 
					Message-ID, Subject line, and Received header timestamps, if there is access to the mail 
					server logs, but at best it is painful and time-consuming, and only worth doing in an 
					exceptional case. </t>
					
				<t> The solution is similar to the one used for automated bounce handling using VERP -- 
					embed the information in the email in a way that it is unlikely to be removed by 
					Feedback Providers but is easy to recognize in the email. That information may 
					already be there in a form such as VERP if the Return-Path header is included in 
					the embedded email, or included in one-click unsubscribe links included in the body 
					of the email. If it is not already there, a good place to add the information is in 
					the local part of the Message-ID as that is often used to track the progress of 
					email through delivery. It is often available from log files as well as in the 
					headers of the original message included in the Feedback Message. </t>
					
				<t> There are several good ways to store the mapping between Recipients and identifiers 
					in mail. For a database-backed ESP or bulk sender, a synthesized database primary key 
					can be used. It is very small, and very opaque, and it is not expensive to retrieve 
					the associated data from the main database -- but it is impossible to read by hand. 
					Therefore, it needs automation with access to the core database to map the key onto 
					the actual data. </t>
					
				<t> Recording the required information directly within the email but encrypting it with 
					strong or weak encryption removes the need for database access to extract the data. 
					However, it still does need some automation. </t>
					
				<t> A hybrid approach with the various bits of data stored separately but having some 
					pieces either encrypted or obfuscated is possible by just including a database ID. 
					This can provide a good compromise where most of the data is not immediately obvious 
					to third parties but patterns in it can be recognized by eye. For example, a Message-ID of "esp-423-27-42460@example.com" is opaque to a third party, but someone familiar 
					with the format can tell that it is a Message-ID added by the system. In this case 
					it starts with "esp" followed by three numbers separated by dashes, meaning it is 
					from customer 423, campaign 27, and the Recipient has the database key 42460. Even 
					decoding this manually, while it may not be possible to identify customer number 423, 
					it is easy to recognize that 10 Feedback Messages in a row relate to the same 
					customer. From experience, it is not unusual for the vast majority of reports at an 
					ESP to be about a very small number of customers, and one learns their customer IDs 
					very quickly. </t>
					
				<t> Once a Message Originator embeds Recipient identifiers in an easily recognizable 
					format in all its mail, it is quite easy for a Feedback Message processor to extract 
					that with a conventional expression match and possibly a couple of database queries. 
					It can then suppress that Email Address and record the customer and campaign for 
					future reporting. In the case where the Feedback Messages are recorded in a 
					ticketing system, it can also annotate the tickets with that data (again, for 
					reporting and trending analysis). </t>
					
				<t> A Feedback Message processor is often bolted onto the side of an already complex bulk 
					mail generator, making it difficult to reliably suppress mail to the Recipient. If the 
					delivery data is stored in a way that makes it easy to convert into the same format as 
					the VERP string used for bounce processing then the Feedback processor can create a 
					"fake" hard bounce and send it to the existing bounce processor, suppressing mail to 
					that address. </t>
					
				<t> Mailbox Providers and Access Providers also need to automate Feedback processing. They 
					are usually less interested in the details about the message and more interested in the 
					IP address and which customer sent it. In most cases, the IP address can be extracted 
					easily from ARF metadata; whereas, in other cases, it may need to be extracted from the 
					Received headers embedded in the included original message. That data can then be used 
					both for automated forwarding of Feedback Messages to the originating customer, if the 
					ISP feels that is appropriate, and also for reporting on complaint levels across the 
					ISP's customer base. </t>

<abstract>
<t>STD 11, RFC 822, defines a message representation protocol specifying considerable detail about US-ASCII message headers, and leaves the message content, or message body, as flat US-ASCII text.  This set of documents, collectively called the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, or MIME, redefines the format of messages to allow for</t>
<t>(1)   textual message bodies in character sets other than US-ASCII,</t>
<t>(2)   an extensible set of different formats for non-textual message bodies,</t>
<t>(3)   multi-part message bodies, and</t>
<t>(4)   textual header information in character sets other than US-ASCII.</t>
<t>These documents are based on earlier work documented in RFC 934, STD 11, and RFC 1049, but extends and revises them.  Because RFC 822 said so little about message bodies, these documents are largely orthogonal to (rather than a revision of) RFC 822.</t>
<t>This initial document specifies the various headers used to describe the structure of MIME messages. The second document, RFC 2046, defines the general structure of the MIME media typing system and defines an initial set of media types. The third document, RFC 2047, describes extensions to RFC 822 to allow non-US-ASCII text data in Internet mail header fields. The fourth document, RFC 2048, specifies various IANA registration procedures for MIME-related facilities. The fifth and final document, RFC 2049, describes MIME conformance
  criteria as well as providing some illustrative examples of MIME message formats, acknowledgements, and the bibliography.</t>
<t>These documents are revisions of RFCs 1521, 1522, and 1590, which themselves were revisions of RFCs 1341 and 1342.  An appendix in RFC 2049 describes differences and changes from previous versions.</t></abstract></front>

<t>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) permits a person, role, or organization that owns the signing domain to claim some responsibility for a message by associating the domain with the message. This can be an author's organization, an operational relay, or one of their agents. DKIM separates the question of the identity of the Signer of the message from the purported author of the message. Assertion of responsibility is validated through a cryptographic signature and by querying the Signer's domain directly to retrieve the appropriate public key. Message transit from author to recipient is through relays that typically make no substantive change to the message content and thus preserve the DKIM signature.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This memo obsoletes RFC 4871 and RFC 5672.

<t>Over its thirty-five-year history, Internet Mail has changed significantly in scale and complexity, as it has become a global infrastructure service.  These changes have been evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, reflecting a strong desire to preserve both its installed base and its usefulness.  To collaborate productively on this large and complex system, all participants need to work from a common view of it and use a common language to describe its components and the interactions among them.  But the many differences in perspective currently make it difficult to know exactly what another participant means.  To serve as the necessary common frame of reference, this document describes the enhanced Internet Mail architecture, reflecting the current service.

		 title="Abuse Reporting Format (ARF)" toc="include">
			<section title="A Brief History">
				<t> The approach used by the first Feedback Loop to be deployed -- the "scomp" system at 
					AOL -- was to send an entire copy of the message to the consumer of the Feedback Loop.
					It expected that large Feedback Consumers would embed sufficient information in the 
					email so they could identify which Message Recipient had complained. </t>
					
				<t> That worked well enough when there was only a single entity providing feedback, but 
					as other Mailbox Providers started to offer Feedback, it became clear that it would 
					be useful for the Feedback Provider to be able to add some additional information, 
					both machine readable and human readable, to the report. This led to ARF, the Abuse 
					Reporting Format, which quickly became the de facto standard for Feedback Messages. </t>
					
				<t> Today, ARF is used by nearly all Feedback Providers, both within MAAWG and without, 
					constituting the vast majority of all Feedback Messages generated worldwide. ARF is 
					recognized by all MAAWG members that have developed software or services that consume 
					and process Feedback Messages. There are no competing standards for reporting 
					individual messages. </t>
					
				<t> ARF has now been published by the IETF as <xref target="MARF">RFC 5965</xref>. </t>
			</section>
			
			<section title="Structure of an ARF Message">
				<t> An ARF report (Feedback Message) is sent by email, with one message sent for each 
					Spam report made. It consists of three sections, in a standard 
					<xref target="MIME" /> message format called multipart/report. </t>
					
				<t> The first section contains human-readable plaintext, primarily for the benefit of 
					small Feedback Consumers who are handling reports manually. It typically contains 
					boilerplate text explaining that this is a Feedback Message and providing URLs to 
					other data such as contact information for the Feedback Provider or Mailbox Provider 
					that originated the Feedback Message. </t>
					
				<t> The second section contains some machine-readable information, including the version 
					of the ARF protocol used and the type of report it is ("abuse," "fraud," or other 
					label). It also might include some optional information about the email being 
					reported, such as the original Envelope Sender or the time the mail was received. 
					In theory, the information in this section can be used to mechanically route and 
					triage the report, though in current practice most Feedback Messages are treated 
					identically. As a result, this section is often ignored entirely by Feedback 
					Consumers who prefer to process the third section themselves. </t>
					
				<t> The third section of the report consists of a copy of the original email that the 
					report is about, as a standard <xref target="MIME" /> message/rfc822 attachment. 
					While ideally this would be an unmodified copy of the original email, it is likely 
					that many producers of reports will modify or "redact" some elements of the report, 
					especially the Email Address of the Recipient, due to privacy or other legal 
					concerns. </t>
					
				<t> The strict technical specifications of ARF, as well as some example reports and tools 
					to handle the format, can be found at 
					<eref target="http://mipassoc.org/arf/" />, 
					<xref target="Wise" />,
					and in <xref target="MARF" /> </t>
			</section>
		</section>
		
		<section anchor="appendix2"
		 title="Using DKIM to Route Feedback" toc="include">
			<t> Historically, the IP address of the "last hop" -- the MTA that transferred a message into 
				the receiving Mailbox Provider's administrative domain -- was the sole reliable identifier 
				used to denote the source of a message. With the emergence of authentication technologies 
				such as <xref target="DKIM" />, another identifier can now be used; specifically, the 
				authenticated domain associated with a message. This domain is the "d=" value in a 
				DKIM-Signature header field. </t>
				
			<t> In a social or policy context, applying a DKIM signature to a message is tantamount to 
				stating, "I take responsibility for this message". The DKIM signature is most often applied 
				by the author or originator of a message, which may be far upstream of the "last hop" MTA. 
				This is true particularly in cases where the originator's intended Recipient Email Address 
				is configured to forward to another Recipient Email Address. Stories of users who have 
				strung together multiple forwarding accounts are not uncommon, and these users are unable 
				to complain effectively about Spam because their Mailbox Providers cannot easily or 
				reliably follow the path of a message back to the initial originator.</t>
				
			<t> A single DKIM "d=" value may be used across multiple servers with multiple IP addresses. 
				Servers may be added or removed at any time without changing the dynamics of the DKIM 
				signature. When a Feedback Loop is based on the IP address, the Feedback Consumer must 
				contact the Feedback Provider to change its subscription options every time an IP address 
				needs to be added or removed. However, when a Feedback Loop uses DKIM, no reconfiguration is 
				necessary because the signing domain does not change. </t>
				
			<t> One recurring concern with DKIM, however, is that ESPs often send messages addressed with 
				hundreds or thousands of customer domains, yet they want to receive Feedback Messages for all 
				of these domains. This was particularly difficult with <xref target="DomainKeys" /> (the 
				predecessor to DKIM), which tied the "d=" to the "From" header field. DKIM removed this tie, 
				so it is simple for an ESP to use a domain of its own to sign the message and sign up for 
				Feedback regarding all messages signed with that domain. Such a signature may be in addition 
				to, or instead of, signatures from the various client domains. While there are still many 
				unknowns related to reputation (which will be addressed in a future MAAWG document), this 
				is clearly an appropriate use of DKIM to take responsibility (and receive Feedback) for 
				a message. </t>			
		</section>
		
		<section anchor="appendix3"
		 title="Unsolicited Feedback" toc="include">
			<t> Is it always necessary for a Feedback Consumer to apply for a Feedback Loop or is it 
				permissible for a Feedback Provider to configure a Feedback Loop for a Feedback 
				Consumer without an explicit request? There is continuing debate about whether this 
				is an acceptable practice, and MAAWG is neither endorsing nor condemning such activity 
				at this time. </t>
				
			<t> That said, if a Feedback Provider chooses to send Feedback without being asked first, 
				certain guidelines should be followed. In general, it should make prudent decisions to 
				minimize the negative impact on Mailbox Providers and Access Providers. </t>
				
			<section title="Guidelines">
				<t> This should only be done for Mailbox and Access Providers. </t>
				
				<t> This should only be done after attempting to contact the provider to ask if it is 
					possible to set up a Feedback Loop via the normal practice. </t>
					
				<t> These Feedback Loops should only be set up to send to the published abuse address 
					from the provider's WHOIS record. </t>
			</section>
			
			<section title="Pros">
				<t> Feedback Consumers may not realize they have abuse problems until 
					they begin receiving the spam complaints. </t>
					
				<t> Feedback Consumers may not be aware of Feedback Loops and may appreciate the 
					additional data feed. </t>
					
				<t> Upstream providers have an additional information stream to help 
					them identify problem customers. </t>
					
				<t> Spam coming from a network is abuse; therefore it is appropriate to send reports of 
					the abuse back to the Mailbox Provider or Access Provider. Setting up a Feedback 
					Loop automates the process. </t>
			</section>
			
			<section title="Cons">
				<t> It creates confusion for Feedback Consumers if they did not apply and 
					do not understand why they are suddenly receiving complaints. </t>
					
				<t> It can conflict with existing Terms of Service because a new feed of information 
					is available. For example, if a provider has a policy to terminate service after 
					a certain number of abuse complaints, and it starts receiving unexpected Feedback 
					Loop complaints, it may either be forced to terminate customers that did not have 
					a previous issue or be required to update its Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy agreements. </t>
					
				<t> Upstream providers do not have access to the mail being sent by their customers, 
					so they cannot tell whether bulk mail complaints constitute a problem. </t>
					
				<t> The listed abuse address may not be the correct place for automated 
					spam complaints to be sent. </t>
					
				<t> The listed abuse address may feed into a ticketing system that is 
					not capable of correctly handling ARF messages. </t>
					
				<t> Feedback Consumers may not be equipped to handle the volume or format 
					of complaints without some warning and preparation. </t>
