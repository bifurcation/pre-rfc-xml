      <t>
      This document describes what it means to say that a Domain Name
      (DNS name) is reserved for special use, when reserving such a name is
      appropriate, and the procedure for doing so. It establishes an IANA
      registry for such domain names, and seeds it with entries for some
      of the already established special domain names.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
      Certain individual IP addresses and IP address ranges
      are treated specially by network implementations and,
      consequently, are not suitable for use as unicast addresses.
      For example, IPv4 addresses 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 are
      multicast addresses <xref target="RFC5735"/>,
      with 224.0.0.1 being the "all hosts" multicast address
      <xref target="RFC1112"/> <xref target="RFC5771"/>.
      Another example is 127.0.0.1, the IPv4 "local host" address
      <xref target="RFC5735"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
      Analogous to Special-Use IPv4 Addresses <xref target="RFC5735"/>,
      the Domain Name System (DNS) <xref target="RFC1034"/><xref target="RFC1035"/>
      has its own concept of reserved names, such as "example.com.",
      "example.net.", and "example.org.", or any name falling under the
      top-level pseudo-domain "invalid." <xref target="RFC2606"/>.
      However, "Reserved Top Level DNS Names" <xref target="RFC2606"/>
      does not state whether implementations are expected to treat such
      names differently, and if so, in what way.
      </t>

      <t>
      This document specifies under what circumstances special treatment
      is appropriate, and in what ways.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in
      <xref target="RFC2119">"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Applicability">
      <t>
      When IP multicast was created <xref target="RFC1112"/>,
      implementations had to be updated to understand what an IP multicast
      address means and what to do with it. Adding IP multicast to a
      networking stack entailed more than merely adding the right
      routing table entries for those addresses. Moreover, supporting IP
      multicast entails some level of commonality that is consistent
      across all conformant hosts, independent of what networks those
      hosts may be connected to. While it is possible to build a private
      isolated network using whatever valid unicast IP addresses and
      routing topology one chooses (regardless of whether those unicast
      IP addresses are already in use by other hosts on the public Internet),
      the IPv4 multicast address 224.0.0.1 is always the "all hosts"
      multicast address, and that's not a local decision.
      </t>

      <t>
      Similarly, if a domain name has special properties that affect the
  way hardware and software implementations handle the name, that
  apply universally regardless of what network the implementation may be connected to, then that domain name may be a candidate for having the IETF
  declare it to be a Special-Use Domain Name and specify what special treatment implementations should give to that name.
      On the other hand, if declaring a given name to be special would result in no change
      to any implementations, then that suggests that the name may not be
      special in any material way, and it may be more appropriate to use
      the existing DNS mechanisms <xref target="RFC1034"/> to provide
      the desired delegation, data, or lack-of-data, for the name in question.
      Where the desired behaviour can be achieved via the existing
      domain name registration processes, that process should be used.
      Reservation of a Special-Use Domain Name is not a mechanism for
      circumventing normal domain name registration processes.
      </t>

      <t>
      As an example,
      suppose there were to be an IETF document specifying that a particular name
      (or set of names) is guaranteed to produce an NXDOMAIN
      ("Name Error" <xref target="RFC1035"/>) result. Such a document falls within
      the responsibilities of the IETF. The IETF is responsible for protocol rules.
      The IETF defines name character set, length limits, syntax, the fact
  that in DNS "A" is equivalent to "a", etc. <xref target="RFC1034"/>
<xref target="RFC1035"/>. 
      Portions of the namespace created by those
      rules are given to ICANN to manage, but, due to established DNS protocol rules, ICANN is not free to allocate "COM" and "com" to two different name servers. The IETF
      has responsibility for specifying how the DNS protocol works, and ICANN is
      responsible for allocating the names made possible by that DNS protocol.
      Now, suppose a developer were to use this special "guaranteed nonexistent" name,
      "knowing" that it's guaranteed to return NXDOMAIN, and suppose also that the user's DNS server fails to return NXDOMAIN
  for this name. The developer's
      software then fails. Who do the user and/or developer complain to? ICANN?
      The IETF? The DNS server operator? If the developer can't depend on the special
      "guaranteed nonexistent" name to always return NXDOMAIN, then the special name
      is worthless, because it can't be relied on to do what it is supposed to.
      For this special "guaranteed nonexistent" name to have any use, it has to be
      defined to return NXDOMAIN, BY PROTOCOL, for all installations, not just by ICANN
      allocation on the public Internet. ICANN has no jurisdiction over how users
      choose to configure their own private DNS servers on their own private networks,
      but developers need a protocol  specification that states that returning positive answers for the special "guaranteed nonexistent" name is a protocol violation on *all*
      networks, not just the public Internet. Hence, the act of defining such a special name creates a higher-level protocol rule, above ICANN's management of allocable
      names on the public Internet.

    <section title="Procedure">
      <t>
       If it is determined that special handling of a name is required in
  order to implement some desired new functionality, then an IETF
  "Standards Action" or "IESG Approval" specification <xref target="RFC5226"/> MUST be
  published describing the new functionality.</t>

<t>
  The specification MUST state how implementations determine that the
  special handling is required for any given name.  This is typically
  done by stating that any fully qualified domain name ending in a
  certain suffix (i.e., falling within a specified parent pseudo-domain) will receive the special behaviour.  In effect, this carves
  off a sub-tree of the DNS namespace in which the modified name
  treatment rules apply, analogous to how IP multicast <xref target="RFC1112" /> or IP
  link-local addresses <xref target="RFC3927" /> <xref target="RFC4862" /> carve off chunks of the IP
  address space in which their respective modified address treatment
  rules apply.</t>

<t>  The specification also MUST state, in each of the seven "Domain Name
  Reservation Considerations" categories below, what special treatment,
  if any, is to be applied.  If in all seven categories the answer is
  "none", then possibly no special treatment is required and requesting
  reservation of a Special-Use Domain Name may not be appropriate.

</t>
      
    </section>

    <section title="Domain Name Reservation Considerations">
      <t>
      An IETF "Standards Action" or "IESG Approval"
      document specifying some new naming behaviour,
      which requires a Special-Use Domain Name be reserved to implement this
      desired new behaviour, needs to contain a subsection of the "IANA Considerations" section
      titled "Domain Name Reservation Considerations" giving answers in the seven
      categories listed below. In the case of algorithmically generated
      DNS names, the specifying document needs to clearly identify the set of names
      generated by the algorithm that would require the proposed special treatment.

          <t>DNS Registries/Registrars MUST NOT grant requests to register "invalid" names

          the set of names available for allocation by registries/registrars.
          Attempting to allocate a "invalid" name as if it were a normal
          DNS domain name will probably not work as desired,

        <t>
        The domains "example.", "example.com.", "example.net.", "example.org.",
        and any names falling within those domains, are special in the following ways:

        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Users SHOULD understand that example names are reserved for use in
          documentation.</t>

          <t>Application software SHOULD NOT recognize example names as special
          and SHOULD use example names as they would other domain names.</t>

          <t>Name resolution APIs and libraries SHOULD NOT recognize example
          names as special and SHOULD NOT treat them differently. Name
          resolution APIs SHOULD send queries for example names to their
          configured caching DNS server(s).</t>

          <t>Caching DNS servers SHOULD NOT recognize example names as special and
          SHOULD resolve them normally.</t>

          <t>Authoritative DNS servers SHOULD NOT recognize example names as special.</t>

          <t>DNS server operators SHOULD be aware that example names are
          reserved for use in documentation.</t>

          <t>DNS Registries/Registrars MUST NOT grant requests to register example names
          in the normal way to any person or entity. All example names are registered
          in perpetuity to IANA:

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
      This document outlines the circumstances in which reserving a
      domain name for special use is appropriate, and the procedure for
      having that Special-Use Domain Name recorded by IANA. Any document
      requesting such a Special-Use Domain Name needs to contain
      an appropriate "Security Considerations" section which describes
      any security issues relevant to that special use.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
      IANA has created a new registry of Special-Use Domain Names,
      initially populated with the private-address reverse-mapping domains
      and the Reserved Top Level DNS Names outlined above in <xref target="Initial"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
      When IANA receives a request to record a new "Special-Use Domain Name",
      it should verify, in consultation with the IESG,
      that the IETF "Standards Action" or "IESG Approval" document
      <xref target="RFC5226"/> includes the required "Domain Name
      Reservation Considerations" section stating how the special
      meaning of this name affects the behavior of hardware, software,
      and humans in the seven categories. If IANA and the IESG determine
      that special handling of this "Special-Use Domain Name" is
      appropriate, IANA should record the Special-Use Domain Name, and
      a reference to the specification that documents it, in the registry.
