    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The OpenPGP protocol <xref target="RFC4880"/> can support
      many different symmetric ciphers.  This document presents the
      necessary information to use the Camellia <xref
      target="RFC3713"/> cipher in the OpenPGP protocol.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements Notation">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
      "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
      and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
      described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Camellia">
      <t>Camellia is specified in <xref target="RFC3713"/>.  It is a
      128-bit block cipher (as are AES and Twofish in OpenPGP) that
      supports 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit keys.  This document
      defines the use of Camellia in OpenPGP.</t>

      </texttable>

      <t>OpenPGP applications MAY implement Camellia.  If implemented,
      Camellia may be used in any place in OpenPGP where a symmetric
      cipher is usable, and it is subject to the same usage requirements
      (such as its presence in the Preferred Symmetric Algorithms
      signature subpacket) as the other symmetric ciphers in
      OpenPGP.</t>

      <t>While the OpenPGP algorithm preferences system prevents
      interoperability problems with public key encrypted messages, if
      Camellia (or any other optional cipher) is used for encrypting
      private keys, there could be interoperability problems when
      migrating a private key from one system to another.  A similar
      issue can arise when using an optional cipher for symmetrically
      encrypted messages, as this OpenPGP message type does not
      perform cipher negotiation.  Those using optional ciphers in
      this manner should take care they are using a cipher that their
      intended recipient can decrypt.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>At publication time, there are no known weak keys for
      Camellia, and the Camellia algorithm is believed to be strong.
      However, as with any technology involving cryptography,
      implementers should check the current literature, as well as the
      Camellia home page at
      &lt;http://info.isl.ntt.co.jp/camellia/&gt;, to determine if

<!--[rfced] This link doesn't work. Is there another website to point to?-->

      Camellia has been found to be vulnerable to attack.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA assigned three algorithm numbers
      from the registry of OpenPGP Symmetric-Key Algorithms that was
      created by <xref target="RFC4880"/>.</t>
