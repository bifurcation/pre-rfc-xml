    The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)
    specification defines a generic Distance Vector protocol that is
    adapted to a variety of network types by the application of specific
    Objective Functions (OFs).  An OF states the outcome of the process

    Instance based on the Information Objects available; an OF is not an
    algorithm.</t>

    This document specifies a basic Objective Function that relies only
    on the objects that are defined in the RPL and does not use any protocol
    extensions.

     <section title="Introduction">
	    <t> <xref target="RFC6550">
		 The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) specification
		 </xref> defines a generic Distance Vector
		 protocol that is adapted to a variety of Low-Power and Lossy Network
		 (LLN) types by the application of specific Objective Functions (OFs).
	   </t>

	   <t>
		 A RPL OF states the outcome of the process used by a RPL node to select 
		 and optimize routes within a RPL Instance based on the Information 
		 Objects available. As a general concept, an OF is not an algorithm.
		 For example, outside RPL, "shortest path first" is an OF where the least
		 cost path between two points is derived as an outcome; there are a number
		 of algorithms that can be used to satisfy the OF, of which the well-known
		 Dijkstra algorithm is an example.

	   </t>
	   <t>
		 The separation of OFs from the core protocol specification allows RPL
		 to be adapted to meet the different optimization criteria required by
		 the wide range of deployments, applications, and network designs.

	   </t>
	   <t>
		 RPL forms Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) as collections of Destination-Oriented DAGs (DODAGs) 
		 within instances of the protocol.
		 Each instance is associated with a specialized Objective Function. A DODAG is periodically
		 reconstructed as a new DODAG Version to enable a global reoptimization of the graph.</t>

	 <t>
	 An instance of RPL running on a device uses an Objective Function to
    help it determine which DODAG and which Version of that DODAG it should join. The OF is also
    used by the RPL Instance to select a number of routers within the
    DODAG current and subsequent Versions to serve as parents or as feasible successors.</t>

	 <t>

    The RPL Instance uses the OF to compute a Rank for the device. This
    value represents an abstract distance to the root of the DODAG within
    the DODAG Version. The Rank is exchanged between nodes using RPL and
    allows other RPL nodes to avoid loops and verify forward progression
    toward the destination, as specified in	<xref target="RFC6550"/>.
    Regardless of the particular OF used by a node, Rank will always
    increase; thus, post convergence, loop-free paths are always
    formed.</t>

	   <t> The Objective Function Zero (OF0) operates on parameters that are obtained from provisioning,
		   the RPL DODAG Configuration option and the RPL DODAG Information Object (DIO) base container
		   <xref target="RFC6550"/>.
		   </t>
		   <t>
		   The Rank of a node is obtained by adding a strictly positive, indirectly normalized scalar, 
		   rank_increase (<xref target="vars"/>), to the Rank of a selected preferred parent. 

		   The rank_increase is based on a step_of_rank (<xref target="vars"/>) normalized scalar that can vary with a ratio
		   from 1 (excellent) to 9 (worst acceptable) to represent the link properties. The step_of_rank
		   can be multiplied by a configurable factor called rank_factor (<xref target="parms"/>) that amplifies the rank_increase
		   to reflect the relative preferences between different link types that would be used in the same
		   RPL Instance. The rank_increase can be further adapted as detailed in  <xref target="comprank" />.
		   By default, OF0 encodes the 2-octet Rank in units of 256,
and the default settings allow for the 
		   encoding of a minimum of 28 (worst acceptable) hops and a maximum of 255 (excellent) hops.

		   </t>


  <t> 
       The RPL specification	
      <xref target="RFC6550"/> requires the use of a common OF by all nodes
      in a network. The possible use of multiple OFs with a single network
     is for further study.  </t>
	   <t> The RPL specification	 <xref target="RFC6550"/>
	  does not include any OF
      definitions. This is left for other documents specific to different
      deployments and application environments. Since there is no default OF or metric container in the RPL main specification, it might
	 happen that, unless two given implementations follow the same guidance for a specific problem
	 or environment, those implementations will not support a common OF with which they could interoperate.
	   </t>
		   <t>OF0 is designed as a default OF that will allow interoperation between implementations in a wide spectrum of use cases.

	 This is why OF0 does not specify how the link properties are transformed into a rank_increase
	 and leaves that responsibility to the implementation;
	 rather, OF0 enforces the values for the rank_increase by normalizing the step_of_rank for
	 a normal link and its acceptable range, as opposed to formulating the details of the step_of_rank computation.
	 This is also why OF0 ignores metric containers.

     </section>

	   <section anchor="ovv" title="Objective Function Zero Overview">

		   <t>The RPL specification describes constraints on how nodes select
		 potential parents, called a parent set, from their neighbors.
			 All parents are feasible successors for upward traffic (towards
			 the root). Additionally, RPL allows the use of parents in a
			 subsequent Version of a same DODAG as feasible successors, in which
			 case this node acts as a leaf in the subsequent DODAG Version.
			 
		 </t>

		     <t> The Goal of the OF0 is for a node to join a DODAG Version that
			 offers good enough connectivity to a specific set of nodes or to
			 a larger routing infrastructure though there is no guarantee
			 that the path will be optimized according to a specific metric.  
			 This validation process for the connectivity is implementation and
			 link type dependent and is out of scope.  The validation involves
			 but is not limited to application of <xref target="RFC6550"/>,
			 Sections 3.2.3 and 13, as appropriate and may involve deployment specific policies
			 as well. 
		 Thus, for the purpose of OF0, the term "Grounded" <xref target="RFC6550"/>
			 means that the DODAG root provides such connectivity. How that connectivity is asserted
			 and maintained is out of scope.</t>

	     <t>Objective Function Zero is designed to find the nearest Grounded
			 root.  
			 This can be achieved if the Rank of a node is very close to an
			 abstract function of its distance to the root.
	     This need is balanced with the other need of maintaining some path diversity,
			 which may be achieved by increasing the Rank.
			 In the absence of a Grounded root, inner connectivity within the LLN
			 is still desirable and floating DAGs will form, rooted at the
			 nodes with the highest administrative preference.</t>

			 <t>OF0 selects a preferred parent and a backup feasible successor if one is
	     available. All the upward traffic is normally routed via the preferred parent
			 with no attempt to perform any load balancing.
			 When the link conditions do not let an upward packet through the preferred parent,
	     the packet is passed to the backup feasible successor.</t>

			  <t>A RPL node monitors links to a number of neighbor nodes and can use OF0 to
			 assign a rank_increase to each link.
			 Though the exact method for computing the rank_increase is implementation dependent,
			 the computation must follow the rules that are specified in <xref target="comprank"/>.
				 </t>


	     </section>

	   <section title="OF0 Operations">

	   <section anchor="comprank" title="Computing Rank">
			 <t>An OF0 implementation first computes a variable step_of_rank 
			 (<xref target="vars"/>) associated with a
			 given parent from relevant link properties and metrics. The
			 step_of_rank is used to compute the amount by which to increase the
			 rank along a particular link, as explained later in this section.
			 </t>

			 <t>Computing a step_of_rank based on a static metric such as an
			 administrative cost implies that the OF0 implementation
			 only considers parents with good enough connectivity, and results in a Rank that is analogous to hop-count.
		 In most LLNs, this favors paths with fewer but longer hops of poorer connectivity;
			 it is thus RECOMMENDED to base the computation of the step_of_rank
			 on dynamic link properties such as the expected transmission count (ETX) metric 
			 as introduced in <xref target="DeCouto03"/> and discussed in 
			 <xref target="RFC6551"/>. 
			 <xref target="HYSTERESIS">
		     "Minimum Rank Objective Function with Hysteresis" </xref>
			 provides guidance on how link cost can be computed and on how
			 hysteresis can improve Rank stability.</t>


			 <t>OF0 allows an implementation to stretch the step_of_rank in order to enable
			 the selection of at least one feasible successor and thus maintain path diversity.
			 Stretching the step_of_rank is NOT RECOMMENDED, because it augments the apparent
			 distance from the node to the root, distorts the DODAG from the optimal
			 shape and may cause instabilities due to greedy behaviors whereby
			 depending nodes augment their Ranks to use each other as parents in a loop.
			 Still, an implementation may stretch the step_of_rank with at most a configurable 
			 stretch_of_rank (<xref target="parms"/>) of any value between 0 (no stretch) and 
			 the fixed constant MAXIMUM_RANK_STRETCH (<xref target="consts"/>).</t>


			 <t>An implementation MUST maintain the stretched step_of_rank between
			 the fixed constants MINIMUM_STEP_OF_RANK and
			 MAXIMUM_STEP_OF_RANK (<xref target="consts"/>). This range allows the reflection of a
			 large variation of link quality.</t>


			 <t>The gap between MINIMUM_STEP_OF_RANK and MAXIMUM_RANK_STRETCH
			 may not be sufficient in every case to strongly distinguish links of different
			 types or categories in order to favor, say, powered over battery-operated or 
			 high-speed (wired) over lower-speed (wireless) links, within the same DAG. An implementation SHOULD allow the operator to configure a factor
			 called rank_factor (<xref target="parms"/>) and to apply the factor on all links 
			 and peers to multiply the effect of the stretched step_of_rank in the rank_increase 
			 computation as further detailed below.
			 </t>

			 <t>Additionally, an implementation MAY recognize categories of peers and links,
			 such as different link types, in which case it SHOULD be able to configure a more
			 specific rank_factor to those categories.
			 The rank_factor MUST be set between the fixed constants 
			 MINIMUM_RANK_FACTOR and MAXIMUM_RANK_FACTOR (<xref target="consts"/>).
			 </t>
		     <t>The variable rank_increase is represented in units expressed by the variable
			 MinHopRankIncrease, which defaults to the fixed constant
			 DEFAULT_MIN_HOP_RANK_INCREASE (<xref target="RFC6550"/>); with that setting,
			 the least significant octet in the RPL Rank field in the DIO Base
			 Object is not used.
			  </t>
			 <t>The step_of_rank Sp that is computed for that link is multiplied by the
			 rank_factor Rf and then possibly stretched by a term Sr that is less than or equal to
			 the configured stretch_of_rank.
			 The resulting rank_increase is added
			 to the Rank of preferred parent R(P) to obtain that of this node R(N):
			 </t>
			 <t> R(N) = R(P) + rank_increase where: </t>
			 <t> rank_increase = (Rf*Sp + Sr) * MinHopRankIncrease
			 </t>

			 <t>Optionally, the administrative preference of a root MAY be configured
			 to supersede the goal to join a Grounded DODAG. In that case, nodes will
			 associate with the root with the highest preference available, regardless
			 of whether or not that root is Grounded. Compared to a deployment with
			 a multitude of Grounded roots that would result in the same multitude of DODAGs,
			 such a configuration may result in possibly less but larger DODAGs, as many as
			 roots configured with the highest priority in the reachable vicinity.</t>

	   <section title="Selection of the Preferred Parent">
	     <t>As it scans all the candidate neighbors, OF0 keeps the parent that is

			 <list style="numbers">

<t><xref target="RFC6550"/>, Section 8, spells out the generic
				rules for a node to re-parent and in particular the boundaries
				to augment its Rank within a DODAG Version.
				A candidate that would not satisfy those rules MUST NOT be considered.</t>


<t>Prior to selecting a router as the preferred parent, an
        implementation SHOULD validate the connectivity and suitability 
        of the router as discussed in <xref target="ovv"/>.  This validation 
        involves checking the Layer 2 connectivity to the router, the 
        Layer 3 connectivity offered by the router, and may involve 
        examination of other factors such as locally or globally 
        configured policies.
<vspace blankLines="1" />
        In most cases, a router that does not succeed in the validation
        process cannot be further considered for selection as preferred
        parent.  In any case, a router that succeeded in that validation
        process SHOULD be preferred over one that did not succeed.</t>



				 <t>When multiple interfaces are available,
				 a policy might be locally configured to order them and that
				 policy applies first;
				 that is, a router on a higher-order interface in the policy
				 is preferable.</t>

				 <t>If the administrative preference of the root is configured to
				 supersede the goal to join a Grounded DODAG,
				 a router that offers connectivity to a more preferable root SHOULD be
		 preferred.</t>

		 <t>A router that offers connectivity to a grounded DODAG Version SHOULD be
		 preferred over one that does not.</t>

				 <t>A router that offers connectivity to a more preferable root SHOULD be
		 preferred.</t>

		 <t>When comparing two parents that belong to the same DODAG, a router that
				 offers connectivity to the most recent DODAG Version SHOULD be preferred.</t>

		 <t>The parent that causes the lesser resulting Rank

				 SHOULD be preferred.</t>

		 <t>A DODAG Version for which there is an alternate parent SHOULD be preferred.

<abstract><t>Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of network in which both the routers and their interconnect are constrained.  LLN routers typically operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power).  Their interconnects are characterized by high loss rates, low data rates, and instability.  LLNs are comprised of anything from a few dozen and up to thousands of routers. Supported traffic flows include point-to-point (between devices inside the LLN), point-to-multipoint (from a central control point to a subset of devices inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point).  This document specifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL), which provides a mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point traffic from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point, as well as point-to- multipoint traffic from the central control point to the devices inside the LLN, is supported.  Support for point-to-point traffic is also available.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>The documents defines a terminology for discussing routing requirements and solutions for networks referred to as Low power and Lossy Networks (LLN).  A LLN is typically composed of many embedded devices with limited power, memory, and processing resources interconnected by a variety of links.  There is a wide scope of application areas for LLNs, including industrial monitoring, building automation (e.g.  Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning, lighting, access control, fire), connected home, healthcare, environmental monitoring, urban sensor networks, energy management, assets tracking, refrigeration.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>This document presents a security framework for routing over low power and lossy networks (LLN).  The development builds upon previous work on routing security and adapts the assessments to the issues and constraints specific to low power and lossy networks.  A systematic approach is used in defining and evaluating the security threats and identifying applicable countermeasures.  These assessments provide the basis of the security recommendations for incorporation into low power, lossy network routing protocols.  As an illustration, this framework is applied to IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL).</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) have unique characteristics compared with traditional wired and ad-hoc networks that require the specification of new routing metrics and constraints.  By contrast with typical Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing metrics using hop counts or link metrics, this document specifies a set of link and node routing metrics and constraints suitable to LLNs to be used by the Routing for Low Power and lossy networks (RPL) routing protocol.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>The Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) uses objective functions to construct routes that optimize or constrain the routes it selects and uses.  This specification describes the Minimum Rank Objective Function with Hysteresis (MRHOF), an objective function that selects routes that minimize a metric, while using hysteresis to reduce churn in response to small metric changes. MRHOF works with metrics that are additive along a route, and the metric it uses is determined by the metrics RPL Destination Information Object (DIO) messages advertise.</t></abstract>
