        <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
        <t>
            Low-power and lossy networks (LLNs) is the term commonly used to refer to networks 
            made of highly constrained nodes (limited CPU, memory, power) interconnected by 
            a variety of "lossy" links (low-power radio links or Power-Line Communication (PLC)).
            They are characterized by low speed, low performance, low cost, and unstable connectivity.
            A LoWPAN is a particular instance of an LLN, formed by devices complying with the
            IEEE 802.15.4 standard <xref target="refs.ieee802.15.4"/>.
            Their typical characteristics can be summarized as follows:
        </t>

        <list style="symbols">
            <t>
            Limited Processing Capability: The smallest common LoWPAN nodes have 8-bit processors 
            with clock rates around 10 MHz. Other models exist with 16-bit and 32-bit cores
            (typically ARM7), running at frequencies on the order of tens of MHz.
            </t>
            <t>
            Small Memory Capacity: The smallest common LoWPAN nodes have a few kilobytes 
            of RAM with a few dozen kilobytes of ROM/flash memory. While memory sizes of nodes
            continue to grow (e.g., IMote has 64 KB SRAM, 512 KB Flash memory),
            the nature of small memory capacity for LoWPAN nodes remains a challenge.
            </t>
            <t>
            Low Power: Wireless radios for LoWPANs are normally battery-operated. Their
            radio frequency (RF) transceivers often have a current draw of about 10 to 30 mA, depending on the
            used transmission power level. In order to reach common indoor ranges of up to
            30 meters and outdoor ranges of 100 meters, the used transmission power is set
            around 0 to 3 dBm.
            Depending on the processor type, there is an additional battery current consumption
            of the CPU itself, commonly on the order of tens of milliamperes. However, the CPU power
            consumption can often be reduced by a thousandfold when switching to sleep mode.
            </t>
            <t>
            Short Range: The Personal Operating Space (POS) defined by IEEE 802.15.4 implies 
            a range of 10 meters. For real implementations, the range of LoWPAN radios is 
            typically measured in tens of meters, but can reach over 100 meters in
            line-of-sight situations.
            </t>
            <t>
            Low Bit Rate: The IEEE 802.15.4 standard defines a maximum over-the-air rate of
            250 kbit/s, which is most commonly used in current deployments. Alternatively,
            three lower data rates of 20, 40, and 100 kbit/s are defined.
            </t>
        </list>

        <t>
            As with any other LLN, a LoWPAN is not necessarily comprised of sensor nodes only, 
            but may also consist of actuators. For instance, in an agricultural        environment, 
            sensor nodes might be used to detect low soil humidity and then send commands to
            activate the sprinkler system.
        </t>

            After defining common terminology in <xref target="terminology"/> and describing
            the characteristics of LoWPANs in <xref target="designspace"/>, this document
            provides a list of use cases and market domains that may benefit
            and motivate the work currently done in the 6LoWPAN Working
            Group.

                    There may be one or more LBRs at the LoWPAN boundary. 
                    An LBR is the responsible authority for IPv6 Prefix propagation for 
                    the LoWPAN it serves. An isolated LoWPAN also 
                    contains an LBR in the network; the LBR provides the prefix(es) for

        <t>
            The IEEE 802.15.4 standard distinguishes between two types of
            nodes -- reduced-function
            devices (RFDs) and full-function devices (FFDs). As this distinction is based on some
            Medium Access Control (MAC) features that are not always in use, we are not using this distinction in this document. 
        </t>
        
        <t> <!-- Jan 17,2011, Ralph-->
            6LoWPANs can be deployed using either route-over or mesh-under architectures.  
            As the choice of route-over or mesh-under does not affect the applicability of 6LoWPAN 
            technologies to the use cases described in the document, we will use the term "6LoWPAN" 
            to mean either a route-over or mesh-under network.
        </t>
        
        <t>
            Communication to corresponding nodes outside of the LoWPAN is becoming increasingly
            important for convenient data collection and remote-control
purposes.

                        The intermediate LoWPAN nodes act as packet forwarders
on the link layer or as LoWPAN routers, 
                        and connect the entire LoWPAN in a multi-hop fashion.
 LBRs are used to interconnect a LoWPAN to other
            networks, or to form an extended LoWPAN by connecting multiple LoWPANs. Before LoWPAN
            nodes obtain their IPv6 addresses and the network is configured, each LoWPAN executes
            a link-layer configuration either by the mechanisms specified in
            <xref target="6LowPAN-ND"/> or by using a coordinator that is responsible for
            link-layer short address allocation. However, the link-layer coordinator functionality
            is out of the scope of this document. Details of address allocation in 6LoWPAN ND are
            in <xref target="6LowPAN-ND"/>.
        </t>
        
        <t>
            A LoWPAN can be configured as mesh-under or route-over (see Terminology in
            <xref target="6LowPAN-ND"/>). 
            In a route-over configuration, multi-hop transmission is carried out by LRs
            using IP routing. In a mesh-under configuration,
            the link-local scope reaches to the boundaries of the LoWPAN, 
            and multi-hop transmission is 
            achieved by forwarding data at the link layer or in a 6LoWPAN adaptation layer.
            More information about mesh-under and route-over is in <xref target="6LowPAN-ND"/> and <xref target="6LowPAN-RTG-REQ"/>.

    <!-- DESIGN SPACE -->        
        
        <section anchor="designspace" title="Design Space">
        <t>
            Inspired by <xref target="refs.roemer"/>, this section lists the dimensions 
            used to describe the design space of wireless sensor networks 
            in the context of the 6LoWPAN Working Group. The design space is already limited
            by the unique characteristics of a LoWPAN (e.g., low power, short
range, low bit rate),
            as described in <xref target="RFC4919"/>. The possible dimensions for scenario
            categorization used in this document are described as follows:
        </t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>
            Deployment: LoWPAN nodes can be scattered randomly, or they may be deployed in 
            an organized manner in a LoWPAN. The deployment can occur at once, or as an
            iterative process. The selected type of deployment has an impact on node density
            and location. This feature affects how to organize (manually or automatically) the
            LoWPAN and how to allocate addresses in the network.
            </t>
            <t>
            Network Size: The network size takes into account nodes that provide the intended
            network capability. The number of nodes involved in a LoWPAN could be small
            (ten), moderate (several hundred), or large (over a thousand).
            </t>
            <t>
            Power Source: The power source of nodes, whether the nodes are battery-powered or
            mains-powered, influences the network design. The power may also be harvested from
            solar cells or other sources of energy. Hybrid solutions are possible where only
            part of the network is mains-powered.
            </t>
            <t>
            Connectivity: Nodes within a LoWPAN are considered "always connected" when there is
            a network connection between any two given nodes. However, due to external factors
            (e.g., extreme environment, mobility) or programmed disconnections
            (e.g., sleeping mode), network connectivity can be from "intermittent" 
            (i.e., regular disconnections) to "sporadic" (i.e., almost always disconnected).
            Differences in L2 duty-cycling settings may additionally impact connectivity due
            to highly varying bit rates.
            </t>
            <t>
            Multi-Hop Communication: The multi-hop communication factor highlights the number of
            hops that have to be traversed to reach the edge of the network or a destination node
            within it. A single hop may be sufficient for simple star topologies, but a multi-hop
            communication scheme is required for more elaborate topologies, such as meshes or
            trees. In previous work on LoWPANs by academia and industry, various routing
            mechanisms were introduced, such as data-centric, event-driven, address-centric,
            localization-based, geographical routing, etc. This document does not make use of
            such a fine granularity but rather uses topologies and single/multi-hop communication.
            </t>
            <t>
            Traffic Pattern: Several traffic patterns may be used in LoWPANs --
            Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP), Multipoint-to-Point (MP2P), and
Point-to-Point (P2P), to name a few.
            </t>
            <t>
            Security Level: LoWPANs may carry sensitive information and require high-level
            security support where the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of the
            information are crucial.
            </t>

            <t>
            Mobility: Inherent to the wireless characteristics of LoWPANs, nodes could move or
            be moved around. Mobility can be an induced factor (e.g., sensors
in an automobile) -- and hence not predictable -- or a controlled characteristic (e.g., pre-planned movement in
            a supply chain).
            </t>
            <t>
            Quality of Service (QoS): QoS issues in LoWPANs may be very different from 
            the traditional end-to-end QoS, as in LoWPAN applications one end is not a single 
            sensor node but often a group of sensor nodes. Parameters for QoS should consider
            collective data for latency, packet loss, data throughput, etc. In addition, 
            QoS requirements can be different based on the data delivery model,
            such as event-driven, query-driven, continuous real-time, or continuous 
            non-real-time; these delivery models usually coexist in LoWPAN applications.
            QoS issues in LoWPANs are more likely related to corresponding application-specific data 
            delivery requirements within resource-constrained LoWPANs.

        <t>
            This section lists a fundamental set of LoWPAN application scenarios in terms of system
            design. A complete list of practical use cases is not the objective of this document.

            <!-- INDUSTRIAL MONITORING-->        

        <section title="Industrial Monitoring">
            <t>
            LoWPAN applications for industrial monitoring can be associated with a broad range
            of methods to increase productivity, energy efficiency, and safety of industrial
            operations in engineering facilities and manufacturing plants. Many companies
            currently use time-consuming and expensive manual monitoring to predict failures and
            to schedule maintenance or replacements in order to avoid costly manufacturing
            downtime. LoWPANs can be inexpensively installed to provide more frequent and more
            reliable data. The deployment of LoWPANs can reduce equipment downtime and eliminate 
            manual equipment monitoring that is costly to perform. Additionally, data
            analysis functionality can be placed into the network, eliminating the need for
            manual data transfer and analysis.
            </t>
            <t>
            Industrial monitoring can be largely split into the following application fields:
            <list style="symbols">
            <t>
                    Process Monitoring and Control: This application field combines advanced energy metering and
                    sub-metering technologies with wireless sensor networking in order to optimize
                    factory operations, reduce peak demand, ultimately lower costs for energy, avoid
                    machine downtimes, and increase operation safety. 
                    <vspace blankLines='1' />        
                    A plant's monitoring boundary often does not cover the entire facility but only
                    those areas considered critical to the process. Wireless
                    connectivity that is easy to install extends this line to include peripheral areas and process
                    measurements that were previously infeasible or impractical to reach with wired
                    connections.
            </t>
            <t>
                    Machine Surveillance: This application field ensures product quality and efficient and safe equipment
                    operation. Critical equipment parameters such as vibration, temperature, and
                    electrical signature are analyzed for abnormalities that are suggestive of
                    impending equipment failure.

            </t>
            <t>
                    Supply Chain Management and Asset Tracking: With the retail industry being
                    legally responsible for the quality of sold goods, early detection of inadequate
                    storage conditions with respect to temperature will reduce
the risk and cost of

                    Example: Hospital Storage Rooms
            </t>
            <t>
                    In a hospital, maintenance of the right temperature in storage rooms is very
                    critical. Red blood cells need to be stored at 2 to 6 degrees Celsius, blood
                    platelets at 20 to 24 degrees C, and blood plasma below -18
degrees C. &nbsp;For anti-cancer medicine,
                    maintaining a humidity of 45% to 55% is required. Storage rooms have temperature
                    sensors and humidity sensors every 25 to 100 m, based on the floor plan and the
                    location of shelves, as indoor obstacles distort the radio signals. At each
                    blood pack, a sensor tag can be installed to track the temperature during
                    delivery. A LoWPAN node is installed in each container of a set of blood packs. 
                    In this case, highly dense networks must be managed.
            </t>
            <t>
                    All nodes are statically deployed and manually configured with either a single-
                    or multi-hop connection. Different types of LoWPAN nodes are configured based on
                    the service and network requirements. In particular, LCs play a role in aggregation 
                    of the sensed data from blood packs. 
                    In the extended networks, more than one LoWPAN LC can be installed in a storage room.
                    In the case that the sensed data from an individual node 
                    is urgent event-driven data such as outrange of temperature or humidity, 
                    it will not be accumulated (and further delayed) by the LCs but immediately relayed.
            </t>
            <t>
                    All LoWPAN nodes do not move unless the blood packs or a container of blood
                    packs is moved. Moving nodes get connected by logical attachment to a new LoWPAN. 
                    When containers of blood packs are transferred to another place in the hospital
                    or by ambulance, the LoWPAN nodes on the containers associate to a new LoWPAN.
            </t>
            <t>
                    This type of application works based on both periodic and event-driven
                    notifications. Periodic data is used for monitoring temperature and humidity
                    in the storage rooms. The data over or under a predefined threshold is
                    meaningful to report. Blood cannot be used if it is exposed to the wrong
                    environment for about 30 minutes. Thus, event-driven data sensed on abnormal
                    occurrences is time-critical and requires secure and reliable transmission. 
            </t>
            <t>
                LoWPANs must be provided with low installation and management costs, and for the
                transportation of blood containers, precise location tracking of containers is
                important. The hospital network manager or staff can be provided with an early
                warning of possible chain ruptures, for example, by conveniently accessing
                comprehensive online reports and data management systems.

                    The network configuration of the above use case can differ substantially by
                    system design. As illustrated in <xref target="fig.storage"/>, the simplest way
                    is to build a star topology inside of each storage room.  
                    Based on the layout and size of the storage room, the LoWPAN can be configured 
                    in a different way -- mesh topology -- as shown in <xref target="fig.Ext-storage"/>. 
            </t>
            <t>
                    Each LoWPAN node may reach the LBR by a predefined routing/forwarding mechanism. 
                    Each LoWPAN node configures its link-local address and obtains a prefix from its
                    LBR by a 6LoWPAN ND procedure <xref target="6LowPAN-ND"/>. 
                    LoWPAN nodes need to build a multi-hop connection to reach the LCs and LBR.
            </t>
            <t>
                Secure data transmission and authentication are crucial in a hospital scenario, to
                prevent personal information from being retrieved by an adversary. Confidential data must
                be encrypted not only in transmission, but also when stored on nodes, because nodes
                can potentially be stolen.
            </t>
            <t>
                    The data volume is usually not so large in this case, but is sensitive to delay. 
                    Data aggregators can be installed for each storage room, or just one data aggregator
                    can collect all data. To make a light transmission, UDP is likely to be chosen, 
                    but a secure transmission and security mechanism must be added. 
                    To increase security, link-layer mechanisms and/or additional security
                    mechanisms should be used.
            </t>
            <t>
                    Because a failure of a LoWPAN node can critically affect the storage of the blood
                    packs, network management is important in this use case. A lightweight management 
                    mechanism must be provided for this management.
            </t>
            <t> <!-- Improvement of QoS, July, 2011 -->
                    The service quality of this case is highly related to effective handling of 
                    event-driven data that is delay intolerant and mission critical.
                    Wrong humidity and wrong temperature are events that need to be detected as quickly and reliably
                    as possible. It is important to provide efficient resource usage for such data 
                    with consideration of minimal usage of energy. 
                    Energy-aware QoS support in wireless sensor networks is a challenging issue <xref target="refs.chen"/>.
                    It can be considered to provide appropriate data
aggregation for minimizing delay and
                    maximizing accuracy of delivery by using power-affluent
nodes, or can be
                    aided by middleware or other types of network elements.

            <t>
                    When a container is moved out of the storage room and connected to another hospital
                    system (if the hospital buildings are fully or partly covered with LoWPANs), 
                    a mechanism to rebind to a new parent node and a new LoWPAN must be supported.  
                    In the case that it is moved by an ambulance, it will be connected to an LBR
                    in the vehicle. This type of mobility is supported by the 6LoWPAN ND and routing mechanism.

            <t>            
                    LoWPANs must be provided with low installation and management
                    costs, providing benefits such as reduced inventory, and precise location tracking
                    of containers and mobile equipment (e.g., beds moved in the hospital, ambulances).

            Intelligent monitoring in facility management can make safety checks and periodic
            monitoring of the architecture status highly efficient. Mains-powered nodes can be
            included in the design phase of construction, or battery-equipped nodes can be
            added afterwards. All nodes are static and manually deployed. Some data is not
            critical for security protection (such as periodic or query-driven notification of
            normal room temperature), but event-driven
            emergency data (such as a fire alarm) must be handled in a very critical manner.

            <t>
                    A 1000-m-long concrete bridge with 10 pillars is described. Each pillar and the
                    bridge body contain 5 sensors to measure the water level, and 5 vibration sensors
                    are used to monitor its structural health. The LoWPAN nodes are deployed to have
                    100-m line-of-sight distance from each other. All nodes are placed statically and
                    manually configured with a single-hop connection to the local coordinator. All
                    LoWPAN nodes are immobile while the service is provided. Except for the pillars,
                    there are no special obstacles causing attenuation of node signals, but careful
                    configuration is needed to prevent signal interference between LoWPAN nodes.
            </t>
            <t>
                    The physical network topology is changed in case of node failure. On the
                    top part of each pillar, a sink node is placed to collect the sensed data.
                    The sink nodes of each pillar become data-gathering points of the LoWPAN hosts
                    at the pillar and act as local coordinators.

                    networks of the same kind still have similar characteristics, such as static
                    node placement and manual deployment; depending on the
blueprint of
                    the structure, mesh topologies will be built with mains-powered relay points.
                    Periodic, query-driven, and event-driven real-time data gathering is performed,

            <t>
                   The network configuration of this use case can be done via simple topologies;
                   however, there are many extended use cases for more complex structures. 
                   The example bridge monitoring case may be the simplest case.
                   (An example topology is illustrated in <xref
target="fig.bridge"/>.)</t>

            <t>
                    The LoWPAN nodes are installed in place after manual optimization of their location.
                    As the communication of the leaf LoWPAN nodes may be limited to the data-gathering points, 
                    both 16-bit and 64-bit addresses can be used for IPv6 link-local addresses <xref target="RFC4944"/>.
            </t>
            <t>
                    Each pillar might have one LC for data collection.
                    Communication schedules should be set up between leaf nodes and their LC to efficiently gather
                    the different types of sensed data. Each data packet may include meta-information
                    about its data, or the type of sensors could be encoded in its address during
                    address allocation. 
            </t>
            <t>        
                    This type of application works based on periodic, query-driven, and
                    event-driven notifications. The data over or under a predefined threshold is
                    meaningful to report. Event-driven data sensed on abnormal occurrences is
                    time-critical and requires secure and reliable transmission. Alternatively, for energy
                    conservation, all nodes may have periodic and long sleep modes but wake up on
                    certain events. To ensure the reliability of such emergency event-driven data,
                    such data is immediately relayed to a power-affluent or mains-powered node 
                    that usually takes a LoWPAN router role and does not go into a long sleep status. 
                    The data-gathering entity can be programmed to trigger
                    actuators installed in the infrastructure when a certain
                    threshold value has been reached.

                    Due to the safety-critical data of the structure, authentication and security
                    are important issues here. Only authenticated users must be allowed to
                    access the data. Additional security should be provided at the LBR 
                    for restricting access from outside of the LoWPAN. The LBR may take
                    charge of authentication of LoWPAN nodes. Reliable and secure data transmission
                    must be guaranteed.

                The "Connected" Home or "Smart" home is without doubt an area where LoWPANs
                can be used to support an increasing number of services:

                <t>
                In home environments, LoWPANs typically comprise a few dozen and, probably in
                the near future, a few hundred nodes of various types: sensors, actuators, and
                connected objects.

                        Example: Home Automation
                </t>
                <t>
                        The home automation and control system LoWPAN offers a wide range of services: local
                        or remote access from the Internet (via a secured edge router) to monitor the home (temperature,
                        humidity, activation of remote video surveillance,
status of the doors (locked or open), etc.), as well as
                        home control (activate air conditioning/heating, door locks, sprinkler systems, etc.). Fairly
                        sophisticated systems can also optimize the level of energy consumption, thanks to a wide range
                        of input from various sensors connected to the
             LoWPAN -- light sensors, presence detection,
                        temperature, etc. -- in order to control electric window shades, chillers, air flow control, air conditioning,
                        and heating.
                </t>
                <t>
                        With the emergence of "Smart Grid" applications, the LoWPAN        
                        may also have direct interactions with the Grid itself via the Internet
                        to report the amount of kilowatts that could be load-shed (home to Grid) 
                        and to receive dynamic load-shedding information if/when required (Grid to 
                        home): This application is also referred to as a Demand-Response application. 
                        Another service, known as Demand-Side Management (DSM), could be provided 
                        by utilities to monitor and report to the user his energy consumption, with a 
                        fine granularity (on a per-device basis). A user can
also receive other inputs from the utility, such as dynamic pricing;
according to local policy, the utility may
then turn some appliances on or off in order to reduce its energy bill.
                </t>
                <t>
                    In terms of home safety and security, the LoWPAN is made up
of motion sensors and audio sensors, sensors at doors and windows, and video cameras; 
                    additional sensors can be added for safety (gas, water, CO, 
                    Radon, smoke detection).  The LoWPAN is typically comprised
of a few dozen 
                    nodes forming an ad hoc network with multi-hop routing, since the 
                    nodes may not be in direct range.  It is worth mentioning that the number of 
                    devices tends to grow, considering the number of new applications for the home. 
                    In its simplest form, all nodes are static and communicate with 
                    a central control module, but more sophisticated scenarios may also 
                    involve inter-device communication. For example, a motion/presence sensor 
                    may send a multicast message to a group of lights to be switched on, 
                    or a video camera may be activated to send a video stream
to a cell phone via a gateway.
                </t>
                <t>
                        Ergonomics in connected homes is key, and the LoWPAN must be self-managed and easy to install.
                        Traffic patterns may vary greatly, depending on
applicability; so does the level of reliability
                        and QoS expected from the LoWPAN. Humidity sensing is typically not critical and requires no immediate
                        action, whereas tele-assistance or gas-leak detection is critical and requires 
                        a high degree of reliability.
                        Furthermore, although some actions may not involve critical data, the response time and network
                        delays must still be on the order of a few hundred
milliseconds for optimal
                        user experience (e.g., use a remote control to switch a light on). 
                        A minority of nodes are mobile (with slow motion). 
                        With the emergence of energy-related applications, it becomes crucial to preserve 
                        data confidentiality. Connected home LoWPANs usually do not require multi-topology 
                        or QoS routing. Fairly simple QoS mechanisms are enough
for handling emergency data; they can be programmed to alarm via actuators or
to operate sprinklers.

                <t>
                        In the home automation use case, the network topology is made of a mix of 
                        battery-operated and mains-powered nodes that communicate with 
                        each other. An LBR provides connectivity to the outside

                <t>
                        In the home network, installation and management must be extremely simple for the user. 
                        Link-local IPv6 addresses can be used by nodes with no external communication,
                        and the LBR allocates routable addresses to communicate with other LoWPAN nodes 
                        not reachable over a single radio transmission.

                        In some scenarios, traffic will be sent to a LC for processing; the LC
                        may in turn decide on local actions (switch a light on, ...). In other scenarios, 
                        all devices will send their data to the LCs, which in turn may also act as the LBR 
                        for data processing and potential relay of data outside of the LoWPAN. 
                        It does not mean that all devices communicate with each other via the LC and LBR.
                        For the sake of illustration, some of the data may be processed to trigger 
                        local action (e.g., switch off an appliance), simply store and send data once 
                        enough data has been accumulated (e.g., energy consumption for the past 6 hours 
                        for a set of appliances), or trigger an alarm that is immediately sent to 
                        a datacenter (e.g., gas-leak detection).
                </t>
                <t> 
                    Although in the majority of cases nodes within the LoWPAN will be in direct range, 
                    some nodes will reach the LBR/LC  with a path of 2-3 hops
                    (with the emergence of several 
                    low-power media, such as low-power PLC) in which case LoWPAN routers will be deployed 
                    in the home to interconnect the various IPv6 links.

                <t> 
                        The home LoWPAN must be able to provide extremely reliable communication 
                        in support of some specific applications (e.g., fire,
gas-leak detection, 
                        health monitoring), whereas other applications may not be critical (e.g., humidity monitoring).
                                                 Such emergency data has the same QoS issues as does event-driven data in other applications 
                                                 and can be delivered by pre-defined paths through mains-powered 
                                                 nodes without being stored in intermediate nodes such as LCs.
                        Similarly, some information may require the use of security mechanisms 
                        for authentication and confidentiality.

                LoWPANs are envisioned to be heavily used in healthcare environments. They have a
                high potential for easing the deployment of new services by getting rid of cumbersome
                wires and simplifying patient care in hospitals and at home
(home care). In healthcare
                environments, delayed or lost information may be a matter of life or death.
                </t>
                <t>
                Various systems, ranging from simple wearable remote controls for tele-assistance
                or intermediate systems with wearable sensor nodes monitoring various metrics to
                more complex systems for studying life dynamics, can be supported by LoWPANs. In the
                latter category, a large amount of data from various LoWPAN nodes can be collected:
                movement pattern observation, checks that medicaments have been taken, object
                tracking, and more. An example of such a deployment is described in
                <xref target="refs.hartog"/> using the concept of "personal networks".
                </t>

                <t>
                        A senior citizen who lives alone wears one to several
wearable LoWPAN nodes to
                        measure heartbeat, pulse rate, etc. Dozens of LoWPAN nodes are densely installed
                        at home for movement detection. An LBR at home will send the sensed
                        information to a connected healthcare center. Portable base stations with LCDs
                        may be used to check the data at home, as well. The different roles of devices
                        have different duty cycles, which affect node management.
                </t>
                <t>
                        Multipath interference may often occur due to the mobility of patients at home, 
                        where there are many walls and obstacles. Even during sleep, the change of
                        body position may affect radio propagation.
                </t>        
                <t>
                        Data is gathered in both periodic and event-driven fashion. In this application, 
                        event-driven data can be very time-critical. Thus, real-time and reliable
                        transmission must be guaranteed.
                </t>                
                <t>
                        Privacy also becomes a serious issue in this case, as the sensed data is very personal.
                        A small set of secret keys can be shared within the sensor nodes during bootstrapping procedures
                        in order to build a secure link without using much memory and energy. 
                        In addition, different data will be provided to the
hospital system from that
                        given to a patient's family members. Role-based access control is needed to
                        support such services; thus, support of authorization and authentication is important.

                        In this use case, the local network size is rather
small (say, 10 nodes or less).
                        The home care system is statically configured with multi-hop paths, and the
                        patient's body network can be built as a star topology. The LBR
                        at home is the sink node in the routing path from sources on the patient's body.
                        A plug-and-play configuration is required. As the communication of the system is limited
                        to a home environment, both 16-bit and 64-bit addresses
can be used for IPv6 link-local
                        addresses <xref target="RFC4944"/>. An example topology is provided in <xref target="fig.healthcare"/>.
                </t>

                <t>
                        The patient's body network can be simply configured as a star topology with a LC
                        dealing with data aggregation and dynamic network attachment when the patient
                        moves around at home. As multipath interference may often occur due to the
                        patient's mobility at home, the deployment of LoWPAN nodes and transmission
                        paths should be well considered. At home, some nodes can be installed with
                        power-affluence status, and those LoWPAN nodes can be used for relaying points
                        or data aggregation points. 
                </t>
                <t>
                        The sensed information must be maintained with the identification of the patient,
                        no matter whether the patient visits the connected hospital or stays at home.
                        If the patient's LoWPAN uses a globally unique IPv6 address, the address can be
                        used for patient identification. However, this 
                                                incurs a cost in terms of privacy and security.
                        The hospital LoWPAN to which the patient's information is transferred needs to 
                        operate an additional identification system, together 
                                                with a strong authority and authentication mechanism.
                        The connection between the LBR at home and the LBR at the hospital must be 
                        reliable and secure, as the data is privacy-critical. To achieve this, an additional
                        policy for security between the two LoWPANs is recommended.

                LoWPANs play an important role in intelligent transportation systems. Incorporated
                into roads, vehicles, and traffic signals, they contribute to the improvement of safety
                in transportation systems. Through traffic or air-quality monitoring, they increase
                the possibility of traffic flow optimization, and they help reduce road congestion.

                <t>
                       As shown in <xref target="fig.telematics"/>, LoWPAN
nodes for motion monitoring are incorporated
                       into roads during road construction. When a car passes over
                       these nodes, it is then possible to track, for safety
                       purposes, the trajectory (path) and velocity of the car.
                </t>
                <t>
                        The lifetime of LoWPAN nodes incorporated into
                        roads is expected to be as long as the lifetime of the roads (about 10 years). 
                        Multi-hop communication is possible between LoWPAN nodes, and the network should
                        be able to cope with the deterioration over time of node density due to power
                        failures. Sink nodes placed at the side of the road are most likely mains-powered; LoWPAN nodes in
                        the roads run on batteries. Power-saving schemes might intermittently disconnect
                        the nodes. A rough estimate of 4 nodes per square meter is needed. 
                        Other applications may involve car-to-car communication for increased road safety.

                    Given the fact that nodes are incorporated into the road, tampering with sensors is
                        difficult for an adversary. However, the application must be robust against possible
                        attacks and node failures. Sensed data should thus be used primarily for monitoring

        <section anchor="scenario2" title="Agricultural Monitoring">
                <t>
                Accurate temporal and spatial monitoring can significantly increase 
                agricultural productivity. Due to natural limitations, such as a farmer's inability 
                to check crops at all times of the day, or inadequate measurement tools,
                luck often plays too large a role in the success of harvests. Using a network of 
                strategically placed sensors, indicators such as temperature, humidity, and soil condition 
                can be automatically monitored without labor-intensive field measurements. 
                For example, sensor networks could provide precise information about crops in real time,
                enabling businesses to reduce water, energy, and pesticide usage and enhancing environmental protection.
                The sensing data can be used to find optimal environments for the plants. 
                In addition, the data on planting conditions can be saved by sensor tags, 
                which can be used in supply-chain management.

                <t>
                        In a vineyard of medium to large geographical size,
between 50 and 100 LC
                        nodes are manually deployed in order to provide full signal coverage over the
                        study area. An additional 100 to 1000 leaf nodes with (possibly
                        heterogeneous) specialized sensors (i.e., humidity, temperature, soil condition,
                        sunlight) are attached to the LCs in local wireless star topologies, periodically
                        reporting measurements to the associated LCs. For example, in a 20-acre
                        vineyard with 8 parcels of land, 10 LoWPAN nodes are placed within each parcel
                        to provide readings on temperature and soil moisture. The LoWPAN nodes are able
                        to support a multi-hop forwarding/routing scheme to enable data transmission to a
                        sink node at the edge of the vineyard. Each of the 8 parcels contains one data
                        aggregator to collect the sensed data. 
                </t>
                <t>
                        Localization is important for this type of LoWPAN
when installed in a geographically large area, in order to pin down where an event occurred, and to combine gathered 
                        data with the actual positions of the devices. Using manual deployment, device addresses 
                        can be used for identifying their position and localization. 
                        For randomly deployed nodes, a localization algorithm needs to be applied.
                </t>
                <t>
                        There might be various types of sensor devices deployed in a single LoWPAN, each
                        providing raw data with different semantics. Thus, an additional method is
                        required to correctly interpret sensor readings. Each data packet may include
                        meta-information about its data, or the type of sensor could be encoded in its
                        address during address allocation.

                        The network configuration in this use case might, in the simplest case, look
                        like the configuration illustrated in <xref target="fig.vineyard"/>. This static scenario consists
                        of one or more fixed LBRs that are mains-powered and have a high-bandwidth
                        connection to a backbone link, which might be placed in a control
                        center or connected to the Internet. The LBRs are strategically located at
                        the border of vineyard parcels, acting as data sinks. A number of LCs are
                        placed along a row of plants with individual LoWPAN nodes spread around them.
                </t>
                <t>
                        While the LBRs implement the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol (RFC&nbsp;4861 <xref target="RFC4861"/>) 
                        to connect to the outside of the LoWPAN,
                        the LoWPAN nodes operate a more energy-conserving ND described in
                        <xref target="6LowPAN-ND"/>, which includes basic bootstrapping and
                        address assignment. Each LBR can have predefined forward management information 
                        to a central data aggregation point, if necessary.
                </t>

                <t>
                        LoWPAN nodes may send event-driven notifications when readings exceed certain
                        thresholds, such as low soil humidity, which may automatically trigger a water
                        sprinkler in the local environment. For increased energy efficiency, all LoWPAN
                        nodes are in periodic sleep state. However, the LCs need to be aware of
                        sudden events from the leaf nodes. Their sleep periods should therefore be set
                        to shorter intervals. Communication schedules must be set up between master and
                        leaf nodes, and time synchronization is needed to account for clock drift.
                </t>
                <t>
                        Also, the result of data collection may activate
actuators. Context awareness,
                        node identification, and data collection at the application level are necessary.

<!-- SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS -->        

        <section title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
                Relevant security considerations are listed by application scenario in <xref target="scenarios"/>.
                The security considerations in RFC 4919 <xref target="RFC4919"/> and RFC&nbsp;4944 <xref target="RFC4944"/> 
                apply as well.
            </t>
        
        <t>
            The physical exposure of LoWPAN nodes (especially in outdoor networks) allows an adversary to capture, 
                clone, tamper with, or even destroy these devices. Given the safety issues involved in some use cases, 
                these threats place high demands for resiliency and survivability upon the LoWPAN. 
                The generally wireless channels of LoWPANs are susceptible to several security threats. 
                Without proper security measures, confidential information might be snooped by a "man in the middle". 
                An attacker might also modify or introduce data packets into
the network --
                for example, to manipulate sensor readings or to take control
of sensors and actuators. 
                This specification expects that the link layer is sufficiently protected, 
                either by means of physical or IP security for the backbone link or with MAC sublayer cryptography. 
                However, link-layer encryption and authentication may not be sufficient to provide 
                confidentiality, authentication, integrity, and freshness to both data and signaling packets. 
        </t>
        
        <t> 
            Due to their low-power nature, LoWPANs are especially vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. 
                Example DoS attacks include attempts to drain a node's battery by excessive querying 
                or to introduce a high-power jamming signal that makes LoWPAN nodes dysfunctional. 
                Security solutions must therefore be lightweight and support node authentication, 
                so that message integrity can be guaranteed and misbehaving nodes can be denied participation 
                in the network. A node must authenticate itself to trusted nodes before taking part in the LoWPAN.
        </t>    
        
        <t>
                Considering the power constraints 
                and limited processing capabilities of IEEE802.15.4 devices, IPsec is computationally expensive; 
                Internet key exchange (IKEv2) messaging as described in <xref target="RFC5996"/> is not suited for 
                LoWPANs, as the amount of signaling in these networks should be minimized. 
                Thus, LoWPANs may need to define their own key-management method that requires minimum overhead 
                in terms of packet size and message exchange <xref target="refs.dutertre"/>. IPsec provides authentication and confidentiality 
                between end nodes and across multiple LoWPAN links, and may be useful only when two nodes want to 
                apply security to all exchanged messages. However, in many cases, the security may be requested 
                at the application layer as needed, while other messages can
flow in the network without security overhead.
                Recent work <xref target="MIN-IKEv2"/> shows some promise
                for minimal IKEv2 implementations.
        </t>
        
        <t>
                Security requirements may differ by use case. For example, industrial and structural monitoring 
                applications are safety-critical and secure transmission must be guaranteed, 
                so that only authenticated users are able to access and handle the data. 
                In healthcare systems, data privacy is an important issue. Encryption is required, 
                and role-based access control is needed for proper authentication. In home automation scenarios, 
                critical applications such as door locks require high security and robustness against intrusion. 
                On the other hand, a remote-controlled light switch has no critical security threats.
