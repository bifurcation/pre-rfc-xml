                <t> The Abuse Reporting Format <xref target="ARF"/> defines a
                    message format for sending reports of abuse in the
                    messaging infrastructure, with an eye toward automating
                    both the generation and consumption of those reports. </t>

                <t> The Sender Policy Framework <xref target="SPF"/> is one
                    mechanism for message sender authentication; it is
                    "path-based", meaning it authenticates the route that a
                    message took from origin to destination.  The output is a
                    verified domain name that can then be subjected to some
                    sort of evaluation process (e.g., comparison to a
                    known-good list, submission to a reputation service,
                    etc.). </t>

                <t> This document extends <xref target="SPF"/> to add an
                    optional reporting address and other parameters.
                    Extension of <xref target="ARF"/> to add features required
                    for the reporting of these incidents is covered in <xref
                    target="ARF-AUTHFAIL"/> and <xref
                    target="ARF-AS"/>.</t>

                <t> This document additionally creates a an IANA registry of
                    <xref target="SPF"/> record modifiers to avoid modifier
                    namespace collisions.</t>

                <t> There exist cases in which an ADministrative Management
                    Domain (ADMD) (see <xref target="EMAIL-ARCH"/>) employing
                     <xref target="SPF"/> for announcing sending practices may
                     want to know when messages are received via unauthorized
                    routing.  Currently, there is no such method defined in
                    conjunction with standardized approaches such as
                    <xref target="ARF"/>. Similar information can be gathered
                    using a specially crafted <xref target="SPF"/> record and
                    a special DNS server to track <xref target="SPF"/> record
                    lookups.</t>

                <t> This document defines the following optional "modifier"
                    (as defined in Section 4.6.1 of <xref target="SPF"/>) to
                    SPF records, using the form defined in that specification:

                        mail claiming to be from this domain (see Section 2.4 
                        of <xref target="SPF"/> for a description of how domains
                        are identified for SPF checks) has failed the evaluation
                        algorithm described in <xref target="SPF"/>, in
                        particular because a message arrived via an unauthorized
                        route. To generate a complete address to which the
                        report is sent, the Verifier simply appends to this
                        value an "@" followed by the SPF-compliant domain per
