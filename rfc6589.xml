                <t>This document describes considerations for the transition of
end-user content on the Internet to IPv6. While this is tailored to address end-user content, which is typically web-based, many aspects of this document may
be more broadly applicable to the transition to IPv6 of other applications and

web content sites (sometimes described hereinafter as "high-service-level

high-quality user experience for all of their users during their transition to
IPv6. This document explores the challenges involved in the transition to IPv6,

                <section title='Challenges When Transitioning Content to IPv6' anchor='Challenges-Transitioning-Content' toc='include'>
                <t>The goal in transitioning content to IPv6 is to make that
content natively dual-stack enabled, which provides native access to all end users via both IPv4 and IPv6. However, there are technical and operational
challenges in being able to transition smoothly for all end users, which has
led to the development of a variety of migration tactics. A first step in
understanding various migration tactics is to first outline the challenges
involved in moving content to IPv6.</t>
                
                <t>Implementers of these various migration tactics are
attempting to protect users of their services from having a negative experience
(poor performance) when they receive DNS responses containing AAAA resource
records or when attempting to use IPv6 transport. There are two main concerns
that pertain to this practice: one is IPv6-related impairment, and the
other is the maturity or stability of IPv6 transport (and associated
network operations) for high-service-level domains. Both can negatively affect
the experience of end users.</t> 
            
            <t>Not all domains may face the same challenges in transitioning
content to IPv6, since the user base of each domain, traffic sources, traffic
volumes, and other factors obviously will vary between domains. As a result,
while some domains have used an IPv6 migration tactic, others have run brief
IPv6 experiments and then decided to simply turn on IPv6 for the domain without
further delay and without using any specialized IPv6 migration tactics <xref
target='Heise'/>. Each domain should therefore consider its specific situation
when formulating a plan to move to IPv6; there is not one approach that will
work for every domain.</t>
                
                
                        <section title='IPv6-Related Impairment' anchor='IPv6-Related-Impairment' toc='include'>
                    <t>Some implementers have observed that when they added
AAAA resource records to their authoritative DNS servers in order to support
IPv6 access to their content, a small fraction of end users had slow or
otherwise impaired access to a given website with both AAAA and A resource
records. The fraction of users with such impaired access has been estimated to
be as high as 0.078% of total Internet users <xref target='IETF-77-DNSOP'/>
<xref target='NW-Article-DNSOP'/> <xref target='IPv6-Growth'/> <xref
target='IPv6-Brokenness'/>.</t>
            
                    <t>While it is outside the scope of this document to
explore the various reasons why a particular user's system (host) may have
impaired IPv6 access, and the potential solutions <xref target='RFC6555'/>
<xref target='RFC6343'/>, for the users who experience this impairment,
it has a very real performance impact. It
would impact access to all or most dual-stack services to which the user
attempts to connect. This negative end-user experience can range from access
that is somewhat slower than usual (as compared to native IPv4-based access), to
extremely slow access, to no access to the domain's resources whatsoever. In
essence, whether the end user even has an IPv6 address or not, merely by
receiving a AAAA record response, the user either cannot access a Fully
Qualified Domain Name (FQDN, representing a service or resource sought) or it
is so slow that the user gives up and assumes the destination is
unreachable.</t>

                        <section title='Operational Maturity Concerns' anchor='Operational-Maturity-Concerns' toc='include'>
                        <t>Some implementers have discovered that network
operations, operations support and business support systems, and other
operational processes and procedures are less mature for IPv6 as compared to
IPv4, since IPv6 has not heretofore been pervasively deployed. This operational
immaturity may be observed not just within the network of a given domain but
also in any directly or indirectly interconnected networks. As a result, many
domains consider it prudent to undertake any network changes that will cause
traffic to shift to IPv6 gradually, in order to provide time and experience for
IPv6 operations and network practices to mature.</t>

                        <section title='Volume-Based Concerns' anchor='Volume-Based-Concerns' toc='include'>
                    <t>While <xref target='Operational-Maturity-Concerns'/>
pertains to risks due to immaturity in operations, a related concern is that
some technical issues may not become apparent until some moderate to high
volume of traffic is sent via IPv6 to and from a domain. As above, this may be
the case not just within the network of that domain but also for any directly
or indirectly interconnected networks. Furthermore, compared to domains with
small to moderate traffic volumes, whether by the count of end users or count
of bytes transferred, high-traffic domains receive such a level of usage that
it is prudent to undertake any network changes gradually and in a manner that
minimizes the risk of disruption. One can imagine that for one of the top ten
sites globally, for example, the idea of suddenly turning on a significant
amount of IPv6 traffic is quite daunting and would carry a relatively high risk
of network and/or other disruptions.</t>

                </section>
                
                
            <section title='IPv6 Adoption Implications' anchor='IPv6-Adoption-Implications' toc='include'>
                   <t>It is important that the challenges in transitioning
content to IPv6 as noted in <xref target='Challenges-Transitioning-Content'/> are
addressed, especially for high-service-level domains. Some
high-service-level domains may find the prospect of transitioning to IPv6
extremely daunting without having some ability to address these challenges and
to incrementally control their transition to IPv6. Lacking such controls, some
domains may choose to substantially delay their transition to IPv6. A
substantial delay in moving content to IPv6 could certainly mean there are
somewhat fewer motivating factors for network operators to deploy IPv6 to end-user hosts (though they have many significant motivating factors that are
largely independent of content). At the same time, unless network operators
transition to IPv6, there are of course fewer motivations for domain owners to
transition content to IPv6. Without progress in each part of the Internet
ecosystem, networks and/or content sites may delay, postpone, or cease adoption
of IPv6, or to actively seek alternatives to it.  Such alternatives may include
the use of multi-layer or large-scale network address translation (NAT), which
is not preferred relative to native dual stack.</t>
                   
                   <t>Obviously, transitioning content to IPv6 is important to
IPv6 adoption overall. While challenges do exist, such a transition is not an
impossible task for a domain to undertake. A range of potential migration
tactics, as noted below in <xref target='Potential-Migration-Tactics'/>, can
help meet these challenges and enable a domain to successfully transition
content and other services to IPv6.</t>
                   </section>

                
            <section title='Potential Migration Tactics' anchor='Potential-Migration-Tactics' toc='include'>
                <t>Domains have a wide range of potential tactics at their
disposal that may be used to facilitate the migration to IPv6. This section
includes many of the key tactics that could be used by a domain but by no means
provides an exhaustive or exclusive list. Only a specific domain can judge whether
or not a given (or any) migration tactic applies to it and meets
its needs. A domain may also decide to pursue several of these tactics in
parallel. Thus, the usefulness of each tactic and the associated pros and cons
will vary from domain to domain.</t>
                
                        <section title='Solving Current End-User IPv6 Impairments' anchor='Solve-Current-End-User-IPv6-Impairments' toc='include'>
                   <t>Domains can endeavor to fix the underlying technical
problems experienced by their end users during the transition to IPv6, as noted
in <xref target='IPv6-Related-Impairment'/>. One challenge with this option is
that a domain may have little or no control over the network connectivity,
operating system, client software (such as a web browser), and/or other
capabilities of the end users of that domain. In most cases, a domain is only in
a position to influence and guide its end users. While this is not the same
sort of direct control that may exist, for example, in an enterprise network,
major domains are likely to be trusted by their end users and may therefore be
able to influence and guide these users in solving any IPv6-related
impairments.</t>
                   
                   <t>Another challenge is that end-user impairments are
something that one domain on its own cannot solve. This means that domains
may find it more effective to coordinate with many others in the Internet
community to solve what is really a collective problem that affects the entire
Internet. Of course, it can sometimes be difficult to motivate members of the
Internet community to work collectively towards such a goal, sharing the labor,
time, and costs related to such an effort. However, World IPv6 Day <xref
target='W6D'/> shows that such community efforts are possible, and despite any
potential challenges, the Internet community continues to work together in
order to solve end-user IPv6 impairments.</t>
                   
                   <t>One potential tactic may be to identify which users have
such impairments and then to communicate this information to affected users.
Such end-user communication is likely to be most helpful if the end users are not
only alerted to a potential problem but are given careful and detailed advice on
how to resolve this on their own, or are guided to where they can seek help in
doing so. Another potential tactic is for a domain to collect, track over time,
and periodically share with the Internet community the rate of impairment
observed for that domain. In any such end-user IPv6-related analysis and
communication, <xref target='Privacy-Considerations'/> is worth taking into
account.</t>
                   
                   <t>However, while these tactics can help reduce IPv6-related
impairments (<xref target='IPv6-Related-Impairment'/>), they do not address
either operational maturity concerns (noted in
<xref target='Operational-Maturity-Concerns'/>) or volume-based concerns
(noted in <xref target='Volume-Based-Concerns'/>), which should be considered and
addressed separately.</t>
                   </section>
                   
                        <section title='Using IPv6-Specific Names' anchor='Use-IPv6-Specific-Names' toc='include'>
                   <t>Another potential migration tactic is for a domain to
gain experience using a special FQDN. This has
become typical for domains beginning the transition to IPv6, whereby an
address-family-specific name such as ipv6.example.com or www.ipv6.example.com
is used. An end user would have to know to use this special IPv6-specific name;
it is not the same name used for regular traffic.</t>
                   
                   <t>This special IPv6-specific name directs traffic to a host
or hosts that have been enabled for native IPv6 access. In some cases, this
name may point to hosts that are separate from those used for IPv4 traffic
(via www.example.com), while in other cases it may point to the same hosts used
for IPv4 traffic. A subsequent phase, if separate hosts are used to support
special IPv6-specific names, is to move to the same hosts used for regular
traffic in order to utilize and exercise production infrastructure more
fully. Regardless of whether or not dedicated hosts are used, the use of the
special name is a way to incrementally control traffic as a tool for a domain
to gain IPv6 experience and increase IPv6 use on a relatively controlled
basis. Any lessons learned can then inform plans for a full transition to
IPv6. This also provides an opportunity for a domain to develop any necessary
training for staff, to develop IPv6-related testing procedures for its
production network and lab, to deploy IPv6 functionality into its production
network, and to develop and deploy IPv6-related network and service
monitors. It is also an opportunity to add a relatively small amount of IPv6
traffic to ensure that network gear, network interconnects, and IPv6 routing in
general are working as expected.</t>
                   
                   <t>While using a special IPv6-specific name is a good
initial step to functionally test and prepare a domain for IPv6 -- including
developing and maturing IPv6 operations, as noted in
<xref target='Operational-Maturity-Concerns'/> -- the utility of the tactic is
limited, since users must
know the IPv6-specific name, the traffic volume will be low, and the traffic is
unlikely to be representative of the general population of end users (they are
likely to be self-selecting early adopters and more technically advanced than
average), among other reasons. As a result, any concerns and risks related to
traffic volume, as noted in <xref target='Volume-Based-Concerns'/>, should still be
considered and addressed separately.</t>

                        <section title='Implementing DNS Resolver Whitelisting' anchor='Implement-DNS-Resolver-Whitelisting' toc='include'>
                        <t>Another potential tactic -- especially when a
high-service-level domain is ready to move beyond an IPv6-specific name, as
described in <xref target='Use-IPv6-Specific-Names'/> -- is to selectively return
AAAA resource records (RRs), which contain IPv6 addresses. This selective
response of DNS records is performed by an authoritative DNS server for a
domain in response to DNS queries sent by DNS recursive resolvers <xref
target='RFC1035'/>. This is commonly referred to in the Internet community as
"DNS Resolver Whitelisting", and will be referred to as such hereafter, though
in essence it is simply a tactic enabling the selective return of DNS records
based upon various technical factors. An end user is seeking a resource by
name, and this selective response mechanism enables what is perceived to be the
most reliable and best performing IP address family to be used (IPv4 or
IPv6). It shares similarities with Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), Global Server
Load Balancing (GSLB), DNS Load Balancing, and Split DNS, as described below
in Sections <xref
target='Similarities-to-Content-Delivery-Networks-and-Global-Server-Load-Balancing'
format="counter"/>, <xref target='Similarities-to-DNS-Load-Balancing'
format="counter"/>, and <xref target='Similarities-to-Split-DNS'
format="counter"/>.
A few high-service-level domains have
either implemented DNS Resolver Whitelisting (one of many migration tactics
they have used or are using) or are considering doing so <xref
target='NW-Article-DNS-WL'/> <xref target='WL-Ops'/>.</t>
                
                        <t>This is a migration tactic used by domains as a
method for incrementally transitioning inbound traffic to a domain to IPv6. If
an incremental tactic like this is not used, a domain might return AAAA
resource records to any relevant DNS query, meaning the domain could go quickly
from no IPv6 traffic to a potentially significant amount as soon as the AAAA
resource records are published. When DNS Resolver Whitelisting is implemented,
a domain's authoritative DNS will selectively return a AAAA resource record to
DNS recursive resolvers on a whitelist maintained by the domain, while
returning no AAAA resource records to DNS recursive resolvers that are not on
that whitelist. This tactic will not have a direct impact on reducing
IPv6-related impairments (<xref target='IPv6-Related-Impairment'/>), though it
can help a domain address operational maturity concerns (<xref
target='Operational-Maturity-Concerns'/>) as well as concerns and risks related to
traffic volume (<xref target='Volume-Based-Concerns'/>). While DNS Resolver
Whitelisting does not solve IPv6-related impairments, it can help a domain to
avoid users that have them. As a result, the tactic removes their impact in all
but the few networks that are whitelisted. DNS Resolver Whitelisting also
allows website operators to protect non-IPv6 networks (i.e., networks that do
not support IPv6 and/or do not have plans to do so in the future) from
IPv6-related impairments in their networks. Finally, domains using this tactic
should understand that the onus is on them to ensure that the servers being
whitelisted represent a network that has proven to their satisfaction that they
are IPv6-ready and that this will not create a poor end-user experience for users of
the whitelisted server.</t>
                        
                        <t>There are of course challenges and concerns related
to DNS Resolver Whitelisting. Some of the concerns with a whitelist of DNS
recursive resolvers may be held by parties other than the implementing domain,
such as network operators or end users that may not have had their DNS
recursive resolvers added to a whitelist. Additionally, the IP address of a DNS
recursive resolver is not a precise indicator of the IPv6 preparedness, or lack
of IPv6-related impairment, of end-user hosts that query (use) a particular
DNS recursive resolver. While the IP addresses of DNS recursive resolvers on
networks known to have deployed IPv6 may be an imperfect proxy for judging IPv6
preparedness, or lack of IPv6-related impairment, this method is one of the better
available methods at the current time. For example, implementers have found
that it is possible to measure the level of IPv6 preparedness of the end users
behind any given DNS recursive resolver by conducting ongoing measurement of
the IPv6 preparedness of end users querying for one-time-use hostnames and then
correlating the domain's authoritative DNS server logs with their web server
logs. This can help implementers form a good picture of which DNS recursive
resolvers have working IPv6 users behind them and which do not, what the
latency impact of turning on IPv6 for any given DNS recursive resolver is,
etc. In addition, given the current state of global IPv6 deployment, this
migration tactic allows content providers to selectively expose the
availability of their IPv6 services. While opinions in the Internet community
concerning DNS Resolver Whitelisting are understandably quite varied, there is
clear consensus that DNS Resolver Whitelisting can be a useful tactic for use
during the transition of a domain to IPv6. In particular, some
high-service-level domains view DNS Resolver Whitelisting as one of the few
practical and low-risk approaches enabling them to transition to IPv6, without
which their transition may not take place for some time. However, there is also
consensus that this practice is workable on a manual basis (see below) only in
the short term and that it will not scale over the long term. Thus, some
domains may find DNS Resolver Whitelisting a beneficial temporary tactic in
their transition to IPv6.</t>
                        
                        <t>At the current time, generally speaking, a domain
that implements DNS Resolver Whitelisting does so manually. This means that a
domain manually maintains a list of networks that are permitted to receive IPv6
records (via their DNS resolver IP addresses) and that these networks typically
submit applications, or follow some other process established by the domain, in
order to be added to the DNS Whitelist. However, implementers foresee that a
subsequent phase of DNS Resolver Whitelisting is likely to emerge in the
future, possibly in the near future. In this new phase, a domain would return
IPv6 and/or IPv4 records dynamically based on automatically detected technical
capabilities, location, or other factors. It would then function much like (or
indeed as part of) GSLB, a common practice already in
use today, as described in <xref target='Similarities-to-Content-Delivery-Networks-and-Global-Server-Load-Balancing'/>. Furthermore, in this future
phase, networks would be added to and removed from a DNS Whitelist
automatically, and possibly on a near-real-time basis. This means, crucially,
that networks would no longer need to apply to be added to a whitelist, which
may alleviate many of the key concerns that network operators may have with
this tactic when it is implemented on a manual basis.</t>
                        
                    <section title='How DNS Resolver Whitelisting Works' anchor='How-DNS-Resolver-Whitelisting-Works' toc='include'>
                    <t>Using a "whitelist" in a generic sense means that no
traffic (or traffic of a certain type) is permitted to the destination host
unless the originating host's IP address is contained in the whitelist. In
contrast, using a "blacklist" means that all traffic is permitted to the
destination host unless the originating host's IP address is contained in the
blacklist. In the case of DNS Resolver Whitelisting, the resource that an end
user seeks is a name, not an IP address or IP address family. Thus, an end user
is seeking a name such as www.example.com, without regard to the underlying IP
address family (IPv4 or IPv6) that may be used to access that resource.</t>
                    
                    <t>DNS Resolver Whitelisting is implemented in
authoritative DNS servers, not in DNS recursive resolvers. These authoritative
DNS servers selectively return AAAA resource records using the IP address of
the DNS recursive resolver that has sent them a query.  Thus, for a given
operator of a website, such as www.example.com, the domain operator implements
whitelisting on the authoritative DNS servers for the domain example.com.  The
whitelist is populated with the IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses or prefix ranges of
DNS recursive resolvers on the Internet, which have been authorized to receive
AAAA resource record responses. These DNS recursive resolvers are operated by
third parties, such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs), universities,
governments, businesses, and individual end users.  If a DNS recursive resolver
is not matched in the whitelist, then AAAA resource records WILL NOT be sent in
response to a query for a hostname in the example.com domain (and an A record
would be sent). However, if a DNS recursive resolver is matched in the
whitelist, then AAAA resource records WILL be sent. As a result, while
Section&nbsp;2.2 of <xref target='RFC4213'/> notes that a stub resolver can
make a choice between whether to use a AAAA record or A record response, with
DNS Resolver Whitelisting the authoritative DNS server can also decide whether
to return a AAAA record, an A record, or both record types.</t> 
                       
                    <t>When implemented on a manual basis, DNS Resolver
Whitelisting generally means that a very small fraction of the DNS recursive
resolvers on the Internet (those in the whitelist) will receive AAAA
responses. The large majority of DNS recursive resolvers on the Internet will
therefore receive only A resource records containing IPv4 addresses.
Domains may find the practice imposes some incremental
operational burdens insofar as it can consume staff time to maintain a
whitelist (such as additions and deletions to the list), respond to and review
applications to be added to a whitelist, maintain good performance levels on
authoritative DNS servers as the whitelist grows, create new network monitors
to check the health of a whitelist function, perform new types of
troubleshooting related to whitelisting, etc. In addition, manually based
whitelisting imposes some incremental burdens on operators of DNS recursive
resolvers (such as network operators), since they will need to apply to be
whitelisted with any implementing domains, and will subsequently need processes
and systems to track the status of whitelisting applications, respond to
requests for additional information pertaining to these applications, and track
any de-whitelisting actions.</t>
                    
                    <t>When implemented on an automated basis in the future,
DNS recursive resolvers listed in the whitelist could expand and contract
dynamically, and possibly in near-real time, based on a wide range of
factors. As a result, it is likely that the number of DNS recursive resolvers
on the whitelist will be substantially larger than when such a list is
maintained manually, and it is also likely that the whitelist will grow at a rapid
rate. This automation can eliminate most of the significant incremental
operational burdens on implementing domains as well as operators of DNS
recursive resolvers, which is clearly a factor that is motivating implementers
to work to automate this function.</t>

provide more details on DNS Resolver Whitelisting in general. In addition, the
potential deployment models of DNS Resolver Whitelisting (manual and automated)
are described in <xref target='Potential-Implementation-Phases'/>. It is also
important to note that DNS Resolver Whitelisting also works independently of
whether an authoritative DNS server, DNS recursive resolver, or end-user host
uses IPv4 transport, IPv6, or both. So, for example, whitelisting may not
result in the return of AAAA responses even in those cases where the DNS
recursive resolver has queried the authoritative server over an IPv6
transport. This may also be the case in some situations when the end-user
host's original query to its DNS recursive resolver was over IPv6 transport, if
that DNS recursive resolver is not on a given whitelist. One important reason
for this is that even though the DNS recursive resolver may have no
IPv6-related impairments, this is not a reliable predictor of whether the same
is true of the end-user host. This also means that a DNS Whitelist can contain
both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.</t>

                       <t>The authoritative DNS server for example.com receives
DNS queries for the A (IPv4) and/or AAAA (IPv6) address resource records for
the FQDN www.example.com, for which AAAA (IPv6) resource records exist.</t>

                    <t>The authoritative DNS server checks the IP address
(IPv4, IPv6, or both) of the DNS recursive resolver sending the AAAA (IPv6)
query against the whitelist (i.e., the DNS Whitelist).</t>

                    <t>If the DNS recursive resolver's IP address IS matched in
the whitelist, then the response to that specific DNS recursive resolver can
contain AAAA (IPv6) address resource records.</t>

                    <t>If the DNS recursive resolver's IP address IS NOT
matched in the whitelist, then the response to that specific DNS recursive
resolver cannot contain AAAA (IPv6) address resource records. In this case, the
server will likely return a response with the response code (RCODE) being set
to 0 (No Error) with an empty answer section for the AAAA record query.</t>

                    <t>DNS Resolver Whitelisting is functionally similar to
CDNs and GSLB. When
using a CDN or GSLB, a geographically aware authoritative DNS server function
is usually part of that overall system. As a result, the use of a CDN or GSLB
with an authoritative DNS server function enables the IP address resource
records returned to a resolver in response to a query to vary, based on the
estimated geographic location of the resolver <xref target='Wild-Resolvers'/>
or a range of other technical factors. This CDN or GSLB DNS function is
performed in
order to attempt to direct hosts to a) connect either to the nearest
host (as measured in round-trip time) or to the host that has the
best connectivity to an end user, b) route around failures, c) avoid
sites where maintenance work has taken down hosts, and/or d) connect
to the host that will otherwise provide the best service experience
for an end user at a given point in time. As a result, one
can see a direct similarity to DNS Resolver Whitelisting insofar as different
IP address resource records are selectively returned to resolvers based on the
IP address of each resolver and/or other imputed factors related to that IP
address.</t>

                    <t>DNS Resolver Whitelisting has some similarities to DNS
Load Balancing. There are of course many ways that DNS Load Balancing can be
performed. In one example, multiple IP address resource records (A and/or AAAA)
can be added to the DNS for a given FQDN. This approach is referred to as DNS
round robin <xref target='RFC1794'/>. DNS round robin may also be employed
where SRV resource records are used <xref target='RFC2782'/>. In another
example, one or more of the IP address resource records in the DNS will direct
traffic to a load balancer. That load balancer, in turn, may be
application-aware, and pass the traffic on to one or more hosts that are
connected to
the load balancer and that have different IP addresses. In cases where private
IPv4 addresses are used <xref target='RFC1918'/>, as well as when public IP
addresses are used, those end hosts may not necessarily be directly reachable
without passing through the load balancer first. So, similar to DNS Resolver
Whitelisting, a load balancer will control what server host an end-user's host
communicates with when using an FQDN.</t>

                  <section title='Similarities to Split DNS' anchor='Similarities-to-Split-DNS' toc='include'>
                    <t>DNS Resolver Whitelisting has some similarities to
so-called Split DNS, briefly described in Section 3.8 of <xref
target='RFC2775'/>. When Split DNS is used, the authoritative DNS server
selectively returns different responses, depending upon what host has sent the
query. While <xref target='RFC2775'/> notes that the typical use of Split DNS is to
provide one answer to hosts on an Intranet (internal network) and a different
answer to hosts on the Internet (external or public network), the basic idea is
that different answers are provided to hosts on different networks. This is
similar to the way that DNS Resolver Whitelisting works, whereby hosts on
different networks that use different DNS recursive resolvers receive
different answers if one DNS recursive resolver is on the whitelist and the
other is not. However, Internet transparency and Internet fragmentation
concerns regarding Split DNS are detailed in Section 2.1 of <xref
target='RFC2956'/>. Section 2.7 of <xref target='RFC2956'/> notes
concerns regarding Split DNS, including the concern that the deployment of
Split DNS "makes the use of Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) as endpoint
identifiers more complex". Section 3.5 of <xref target='RFC2956'/> further
recommends that maintaining a stable approach to DNS operations is key during
transitions, such as the one to IPv6 that is underway now, and states that
"Operational stability of DNS is paramount, especially during a transition of
the network layer, and both IPv6 and some network address translation
techniques place a heavier burden on DNS".</t>

                    <section title='Related Considerations' anchor='Related-Considerations' toc='include'>
                 <t>While techniques such as GSLB and DNS Load Balancing
-- which share much in common with DNS Resolver Whitelisting -- are
widespread, some in the community have raised a range of concerns about all of
these practices. Some
concerns are specific to DNS Resolver Whitelisting <xref
target="WL-Concerns"/>. Other concerns are not as specific and pertain to the
general practice of implementing content location or other network policy
controls in the "middle" of the network, in a so-called "middlebox"
function. Whether such DNS-related functions are really part of a middlebox is
debatable. Nevertheless, implementers should at least be aware of some of the
risks of middleboxes, as noted in <xref target='RFC3724'/>. A related document,
<xref target='RFC1958'/>, explains that configured state, policies,
and other functions
needed in the middle of the network should be minimized as a design goal. In
addition, Section&nbsp;2.16 of <xref target='RFC3234'/> makes specific statements
concerning modified DNS servers. Section 1.2 of <xref target='RFC3234'/> also
outlines more general concerns about the introduction of new failure modes
when configuration is no longer limited to two ends of a session, so that
diagnosis of failures and misconfigurations could become more complex. Two
additional sources worth considering are <xref target='Tussle'/> and <xref
target='Rethinking'/>, in which the authors note concerns regarding the
introduction of new control points (e.g., in middleboxes or in the
DNS).</t>

                  <t>However, state, policies, and other
functions have always been necessary to enable effective, reliable, and
high-quality end-to-end communications on the Internet. In addition, the
use of GSLB, CDNs, DNS Load Balancing,
and Split DNS are not only widely deployed but are almost uniformly viewed as
essential to the functioning of the Internet and highly beneficial to the
quality of the end-user experience on the Internet. These techniques have had,
and continue to have, a beneficial effect on the experience of a wide range of
Internet applications and protocols. So, while there are valid concerns about
implementing policy controls in the "middle" of the network, or anywhere away
from edge hosts, the definition of what constitutes the middle and edge of the
network is debatable in this case. This is particularly so given that GSLBs and
CDNs facilitate connections from end hosts and the optimal content hosts, and
could therefore be considered a modest and, in many cases, essential network
policy extension of a network's edge, especially in the case of
high-service-level domains.</t> 
                  
                           <t>There may be additional implications for end
users that have configured their hosts to use a third party as their DNS
recursive resolver, rather than the one(s) provided by their network
operator. In such cases, it will be more challenging for a domain using
whitelisting to determine the level of IPv6-related impairment when such
third-party DNS recursive resolvers are used, given the wide variety of end-user access networks that may be used and given that this mix may change in
unpredictable ways over time.</t>

                    <t>With DNS Resolver Whitelisting, DNS recursive resolvers
can receive AAAA resource records only if they are on the whitelist. DNS
Blacklisting is by contrast the opposite of that, whereby all DNS recursive
resolvers can receive AAAA resource records unless they are on the
blacklist. Some implementers of DNS Resolver Whitelisting may choose to
subsequently  transition to DNS Blacklisting. It is not clear when and if it may
be appropriate for a domain to change from whitelisting to blacklisting, nor is
it clear how implementers will judge that network conditions have changed
sufficiently to justify disabling such controls.</t>
                    
                    <t>When a domain uses blacklisting, it is enabling all
DNS recursive resolvers to receive AAAA record responses, except for what is
presumed to be a relatively small number that are on the blacklist. Over time,
it is likely that the blacklist will become smaller as the networks associated
with the blacklisted DNS recursive resolvers are able to meaningfully reduce
IPv6-related impairments to some acceptable level, though it is possible that
some networks may never achieve that. DNS Blacklisting is also likely less
labor intensive for a domain than performing DNS Resolver Whitelisting on a
manual basis. This is simply because the domain would presumably be focused on
a smaller number of DNS recursive resolvers with well-known IPv6-related
problems. </t>
                   
                   <t>It is also worth noting that the email industry has a
long experience with blacklists and, very generally speaking, blacklists tend
to be effective and well received when it is easy to discover if an IP address
is on a blacklist, if there is a transparent and easily understood process for
requesting removal from a blacklist, and if the decision-making criteria for
placing a server on a blacklist are transparently disclosed and perceived as
fair. However, in contrast to an email blacklist where a blacklisted host
cannot send email to a domain at all, with DNS Resolver Whitelisting,
communications will still occur over IPv4 transport.</t>

                   <t>As an alternative to adopting any of the aforementioned
migration tactics, domains can choose to transition to native dual stack
directly by adding native IPv6 capabilities to their network and hosts and by
publishing AAAA resource records in the DNS for their named resources.
Of course, a domain can still control this transition gradually, on a
name-by-name basis, by adding native IPv6 to one name at a time, such as
mail.example.com first and www.example.com later. So, even a "direct" transition
can be performed gradually.</t> 
                   
                   <t>It is then up to end users with IPv6-related impairments
to discover and fix any applicable impairments. However, the concerns and risks
related to traffic volume (<xref target='Volume-Based-Concerns'/>) should still
be considered and managed, since those are not directly related to such
impairments. Not all content providers (or other domains) may face the
challenges detailed herein or face them to the same degree, since the user base
of each domain, traffic sources, traffic volumes, and other factors obviously
vary between domains.</t>
                   
                   <t>For example, while some content providers have
implemented DNS Resolver Whitelisting (one migration tactic), others have run
IPv6 experiments whereby they added AAAA resource records and observed and
measured errors, and then decided not to implement DNS Resolver Whitelisting
<xref target='Heise'/>. A more widespread example of such an experiment was
World IPv6 Day <xref target='W6D'/>, sponsored by the Internet Society, on
June 8, 2011. This
was a unique opportunity for hundreds of domains to add AAAA resource records
to the DNS without using DNS Resolver Whitelisting, all at the same time. Some
of the participating domains chose to leave AAAA resource records in place
following the experiment based on their experiences.</t>
                   
                   <t>Content providers can run their own independent
experiments in the future, adding AAAA resource records for a brief period of
time (minutes, hours, or days), and then analyzing any impacts or effects on
traffic and the experience of end users. They can also simply turn on IPv6 for
their domain, which may be easier when the transition does not involve a
high-service-level domain.</t>

Whitelisting on a manual basis, the domain may subsequently move to perform DNS
Resolver Whitelisting on an automated basis. This is explained in <xref
target='Implement-DNS-Resolver-Whitelisting'/>, and can significantly ease any
operational burdens related to a manually maintained whitelist.</t>

                        <t>Domains that choose to implement DNS Resolver
Whitelisting generally consider it to be a temporary measure. Many implementers
have announced that they plan to permanently turn off DNS Resolver Whitelisting
beginning on the date of the World IPv6 Launch, on June&nbsp;6, 2012 <xref
target='World-IPv6-Launch'/>. For any implementers that do not turn off DNS
Resolver Whitelisting at that time, it may be unclear how each and every one
will judge the point in time that network conditions have changed sufficiently
to justify
turning off DNS Resolver Whitelisting. That being said, it is clear that the
extent of IPv6 deployment to end users in networks, the state of IPv6-related
impairment, and the maturity of IPv6 operations are all important factors. Any
such implementers may wish to take into consideration that, as a practical
matter, it will be impossible to get to a point where there are no longer any
IPv6-related impairments; some reasonably small number of hosts will inevitably
be left behind as end users elect not to upgrade them or because some hosts are
incapable of being upgraded.</t>

                   <t>Regardless of whether a domain has first implemented DNS
Resolver Whitelisting or has never done so, DNS Blacklisting, as described in
<xref target='Implement-DNS-Blacklisting'/>, may be of interest. This may be
at the point in time when domains wish to make their content widely available
over IPv6 but still wish to protect end users of a few networks with well-known
IPv6 limitations from having a bad end-user experience. </t>

                   <t>A domain can arrive at this phase by either following the
use of a previous IPv6 migration tactic or going directly to this point,
as noted in <xref target='Transition-Directly-to-Native-Dual-Stack'/>. In this
phase, the site's content has been made natively accessible via both IPv4 and
IPv6 for all end users on the Internet, or at least without the use of any
other IPv6 migration tactic.</t>

                   <section title='Security Considerations' anchor='Security-Considerations' toc='include'>
                    <t>If DNS Resolver Whitelisting is adopted, as noted in
<xref target='Implement-DNS-Resolver-Whitelisting'/>, then organizations that
apply DNS Resolver Whitelisting policies in their authoritative servers should
have procedures and systems that do not allow unauthorized parties to modify
the whitelist (or blacklist), just as all configuration settings for name
servers should be protected by appropriate procedures and systems.
Such unauthorized additions or removals from the whitelist (or blacklist)
can be damaging, causing content
providers and/or network operators to incur support costs resulting from end-user and/or customer contacts, as well as causing potential dramatic and
disruptive swings in traffic from IPv6 to IPv4 or vice versa.</t>

            
                    <t>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) as defined in <xref
target='RFC4033'/>, <xref target='RFC4034'/>, and <xref target='RFC4035'/> use
cryptographic digital signatures to provide origin authentication and integrity
assurance for DNS data. This is done by creating signatures for DNS data on a
Security-Aware Authoritative Name Server that can be used by Security-Aware
Resolvers to verify the answers. Since DNS Resolver Whitelisting is implemented
on an authoritative DNS server, which provides different answers, depending upon
which DNS resolver has sent a query, the DNSSEC chain of trust is not
altered. So, even though an authoritative DNS server will selectively return
AAAA resource records or a non-existence response, both types of responses will
be signed and will validate. In practical terms, this means that two separate
views or zones are used, each of which is signed, so that whether or not
particular resource records exist, the existence or non-existence of the record
can still be validated using DNSSEC. As a result, there should not be any
negative impact on DNSSEC for those domains that have implemented DNSSEC
on their Security-Aware Authoritative Name Servers and also implemented DNS
Resolver Whitelisting. As for any party implementing DNSSEC, such
domains should of course ensure that resource records are being appropriately and
reliably signed and are consistent with the response being returned.</t>
                    
                    <t>However, network operators that run DNS recursive
resolvers should be careful not to modify the responses received from
authoritative DNS servers. It is possible that some networks may attempt to do
so in order to prevent AAAA record responses from going to end-user hosts, due
to some IPv6-related impairment or other lack of IPv6 readiness within that
network. But when a network operates a Security-Aware Resolver, modifying or
suppressing AAAA resource records for a DNSSEC-signed domain could break the
chain of trust established with DNSSEC.</t>

                    <section title='Privacy Considerations' anchor='Privacy-Considerations' toc='include'>
                    <t>As noted in <xref target='Solve-Current-End-User-IPv6-Impairments'/>, there is a benefit in sharing IPv6-related impairment
statistics within the Internet community over time. Any statistics that are
shared or disclosed publicly should be aggregate statistics, such as "the
domain example.com has observed an average daily impairment rate of 0.05% in
September 2011, down from 0.15% in January 2011". They should not include
information that can directly or indirectly identify individuals, such as names
or email addresses. Sharing only aggregate data can help protect end-user
privacy and any information that may be proprietary to a domain.</t>
                    
                    <t>In addition, there are often methods to detect
IPv6-related impairments for a specific end user, such as running an IPv6 test
when an end user visits the website of a particular domain. Should a domain
then choose to automatically communicate the facts of an impairment to an
affected user, there are likely no direct privacy considerations. However, if
the domain then decides to share information concerning that particular end
user with that user's network operator or another third party, then the domain
may wish to consider advising the end user of this and seeking to obtain the
end-user's consent to share such information.</t>
                    
                    <t>Appropriate guidelines for any information-sharing
likely varies by country and/or legal jurisdiction. Domains should consider any
potential privacy issues when considering what information can be shared. If a
domain does publish or share detailed impairment statistics, it would be well
advised to avoid identifying individual hosts or users.</t>
                    
                    <t>Finally, if a domain chooses to contact end users
directly concerning their IPv6 impairments, that domain should ensure that such
communication is permissible under any applicable privacy policies of the
domain or its websites.</t>

                    <section title='Considerations with Poor IPv4 and Good IPv6 Transport' anchor='Considerations-with-Poor-IPv4-and-Good-IPv6-Transport' toc='include'>
                   <t>There are situations where the differing quality of the
IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity of an end user could cause complications in
accessing content when a domain is using an IPv6 migration tactic. While today
most end users' IPv4 connectivity is typically superior to IPv6 connectivity
(if such connectivity exists at all), there could be implications when the
reverse is true and an end user has markedly superior IPv6 connectivity as
compared to IPv4. This is not a theoretical situation; it has been observed by
at least one major content provider.</t>
                   
                   <t>For example, in one possible scenario, a user is issued
IPv6 addresses by their ISP and has a home network and devices or operating
systems that fully support native IPv6. As a result, this theoretical user has
very good IPv6 connectivity. However, this end-user's ISP has exhausted their
available pool of unique IPv4 addresses, and uses NAT in order to share IPv4
addresses among end users. So, for IPv4 content, the end user must send their
IPv4 traffic through some additional network element (e.g., large-scale NAT,
proxy server, tunnel server). Use of this additional network element might
cause an end user to experience sub-optimal IPv4 connectivity when certain
protocols or applications are used. This user then has good IPv6 connectivity
but impaired IPv4 connectivity. As a result, the user's poor IPv4 connectivity
situation could potentially be exacerbated when accessing a domain that is
using a migration tactic that causes this user to only be able to access
content over IPv4 transport for whatever reason.</t>
                   
                   <t>Should this sort of situation become widespread in the
future, a domain may wish to take it into account when deciding how and when to
transition content to IPv6.</t>
