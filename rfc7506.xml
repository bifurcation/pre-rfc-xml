    <abstract>
      <t>RFC 4379 defines the MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping/Traceroute mechanism in which the
      Router Alert Option (RAO) MUST be set in the IP header of the MPLS Echo
      Request messages and may conditionally be set in the IP header of the
      MPLS Echo Reply messages depending on the Reply Mode used. While a
      generic "Router shall examine packet" Option Value is used for the IPv4
      RAO, there is no generic RAO value
      defined for IPv6 that can be used. This document allocates a new, generic
      IPv6 RAO value that can be used by MPLS Operations,
      Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) tools,
      including the MPLS Echo Request and MPLS Echo Reply messages for MPLS in
      IPv6 environments. Consequently, it updates RFC 4379.</t>

      <t>The initial motivation to request an IPv6 RAO
      value for MPLS OAM comes from the MPLS LSP Ping/Traceroute. However, this
      value is applicable to all MPLS OAM and not limited to MPLS LSP
      Ping/Traceroute.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>A commonly deployed MPLS OAM tool is specified in <xref
      target="RFC4379"/>, "Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data
      Plane Failures", which is used to diagnose MPLS network data planes.
      This specification, often referred to as "MPLS
      LSP Ping/Traceroute" <xref target="RFC4379"/>, requires the use of the
      Router Alert Option (RAO) in the IP
      header. For example, Section 4.3 of <xref target="RFC4379"/> states
      that the IP RAO MUST be set in the IP header of an MPLS Echo
      Request message. Similarly, Section 4.5 of <xref target="RFC4379"/>
      states that the IP RAO
      MUST be set in the IP header of an MPLS Echo Reply message if the
      Reply Mode in the Echo Request is set to "Reply via an IPv4/IPv6 UDP
      packet with Router Alert".</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC2113"/> defines a generic Option Value 0x0 for IPv4 RAO
      that is used in LSP Ping and LSP Traceroute
      for MPLS in IPv4 environments.

      This IPv4 RAO value of 0x0 is assigned to "Router shall examine packet".
      However, currently there is no generic
      IPV6 RAO value defined that can be used in LSP Ping and
      LSP Traceroute for MPLS in IPv6 environments. Specifically, <xref
      target="RFC2711"/> defined the Router Alert for a general IPv6 purpose
      but required the Value field in the RAO to indicate a
      specific reason for using the RAO. Because there is no
      defined value for MPLS LSP Ping/Traceroute use or for general use, it is
      not possible for MPLS OAM tools to use the IPv6 Router Alert
      mechanism.</t>

      <t>As vendors are starting to implement MPLS on the IPv6 control plane
      (e.g., <xref target="LDP-IPV6"/>), there is a need to
      define and allocate such an Option Value for IPv6 in order to comply
      with <xref target="RFC4379"/>. This document defines a new IPv6 RAO
      value that can be used by MPLS OAM tools, including the
      MPLS Echo Request and MPLS Echo Reply messages for MPLS in IPv6
      environments.</t>

      <t>
  This document closes the gap discussed in the third paragraph
  of Section 3.4.2 in <xref target="RFC7439"/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Specification of Requirements">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IPv6 RAO Value for MPLS OAM">
      <t>This document defines a new Option Value (69) for the IPv6 RAO 
      to alert transit routers to examine the packet more
      closely for MPLS OAM purposes. This Option Value is used by any MPLS OAM
      application that requires their packets to be examined by a transit
      router.</t>

      <t>In the scope of this document, this Option Value will be used by the
      MPLS Echo Request and MPLS Echo Reply for its IPv6 messages, as is required
      by <xref target="RFC4379"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Updates to RFC 4379">
      <t><xref target="RFC4379"/> specifies the use of the RAO
      in the IP header. Sections 4.3 and 4.5 of <xref target="RFC4379"/> are
      updated as follows: </t>

     <t>For every time in which the "Router Alert IP Option"
      is used, the following text is appended: <list style="empty">
          <t>In case of an IPv4 header, the generic IPv4 RAO
          value 0x0 <xref target="RFC2113"/> SHOULD be used. In case of an
          IPv6 header, the IPv6 RAO value (69) allocated
          through this document for MPLS OAM MUST be used.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document defines a new value (69) for the IPv6 RAO
      to alert transit routers to examine the packet more closely for
      MPLS OAM purposes. IANA has assigned a new code point under
      its "IPv6 Router Alert Option Values" registry defined by <xref
      target="RFC2711"/>, updated by <xref target="RFC5350"/>, and maintained
      in <xref target="IANA-IPv6-RAO"/>. The new code point is as follows:
      <figure align="left">
          <preamble/>

          <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[
   Value   Description                       Reference
   -----   -------------------------------   ---------------
      69   MPLS OAM                          RFC 7506
]]></artwork>
        </figure></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document introduces no new security concerns in addition to what
      have already been captured in <xref target="RFC4379"/> and <xref
      target="RFC6398"/>, the latter of which expands the security
      considerations of <xref target="RFC2113"/> and <xref
      target="RFC2711"/>.</t>

      <t>IPv6 packets containing the MPLS OAM RAO are
      encapsulated with an MPLS header and are not expected to be inspected by
      every label switched hop within an MPLS LSP. Consequently, this value of
      the RAO will be processed by the appropriate router and
      is not subject to the problem of being ignored, as described in Section
      2.2 of <xref target="RFC7045"/>.</t>
