      <t> This document directs the IANA to allocate a /32 IPv6 prefix for
      use with the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP    
      <xref target="RFC6830" />), LISP Map-Server 
      (<xref target="RFC6833" />), LISP Alternative Topology
      (LISP+ALT <xref target="RFC6836" />) (or other) mapping

      </t>

      <t> This block will be used as global Endpoint Identifier (EID)

    <section title="Definition of Terms" anchor="definitions">
      
      <t> The present document does not introduce any new terms with
      respect to the set of LISP Specifications 
      (<xref target="RFC6830" />,
        <xref target="RFC6831" />, 
	<xref target="RFC6832" />,
	<xref target="RFC6833" />,
	<xref target="RFC6834" />,
	<xref target="RFC6835" />,
	<xref target="RFC6836" />,
	<xref target="RFC6837" />), but it assumes that the reader is 
	familiar with the LISP terminology. 
	<xref target="LISP-INTRO"/> provides an
	introduction to the LISP technology, including its 
	terminology.
      </t>

    </section>
   
      <section title="Rationale and Intent" anchor="rationale">

	<t>Discussion within the LISP working group led to the identification of
	several scenarios in which the existence of a LISP-specific
	address block brings technical benefits. The most relevant scenarios are described below:
	<list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">

	  <t hangText="Early LISP destination detection:">
	    With the current specifications, there is no direct way to
	    detect whether or not a certain destination is in a LISP
	    domain  without performing a LISP mapping lookup. 
	    For instance, if an Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR) is sending packets
	    to all types of
	    destinations (i.e., non-LISP destinations, LISP
	    destinations not in the IPv6 EID block, and LISP
	    destinations in the IPv6 EID block), the only way to
	    understand whether or not to encapsulate the traffic is to
	    perform a cache lookup and, in case of a LISP cache miss,
	    send a Map-Request to the mapping system. In the
	    meanwhile (while waiting for the Map-Reply), packets may be dropped to avoid excessive buffering. 
	  </t>

	  <t hangText="Avoid penalizing non-LISP traffic:">
	    In certain circumstances, it might be desirable to
	    configure a router using LISP features to natively forward
	    all packets that do not have a destination address in the
	    block and, hence, no lookup whatsoever is performed and
	    packets destined to non-LISP sites are not penalized in
	    any manner. 
	  </t>
	
	  <t hangText="Traffic Engineering:">
	    In some deployment scenarios, it might be desirable to
	    apply different traffic-engineering policies for LISP and
	    non-LISP traffic. A LISP-specific EID block would allow
	    improved traffic-engineering capabilities with respect to
	    LISP vs. non-LISP traffic. In particular, LISP traffic
	    might be identified without having to use Deep Packet Inspection
	    (DPI) techniques in order
	    to parse the encapsulated packet. Instead, performing a simple
	    inspection of the outer header is sufficient.  
	  </t>
	    
	  <t hangText="Transition Mechanism:">
	    The existence of a LISP-specific EID block may prove
	    useful in transition scenarios. A non-LISP domain would
	    ask for an allocation in the LISP EID block and use it to
	    deploy LISP in its network. Such allocation would not be
	    announced in the BGP routing infrastructure (cf.&nbsp;<xref target="usage"/>). This approach will allow non-LISP
	    domains to avoid fragmenting their already allocated non-LISP
	    addressing space, which may lead to BGP routing table
	    inflation since it may (rightfully) be announced in the
	    BGP routing infrastructure.   
	  </t>

	  <t hangText="Limit the impact on the BGP routing infrastructure:">
	    As described in the previous scenario, LISP adopters will
	    avoid fragmenting their addressing space, since fragmentation 
	    would negatively impact the BGP routing infrastructure.
	    Adopters will use addressing space from the EID block,
	    which might be announced in large aggregates and in a
	    tightly controlled manner only by Proxy Tunnel
	    Routers (PxTRs).
	  </t>

	</list>

	It is worth mentioning that new use cases may arise in the future,
	due to new and unforeseen scenarios. 
	</t>

	<t>
   Furthermore, the use of a dedicated address block allows for tighter
   control over the traffic in the initial
   experimental phase (especially filtering), while facilitating its
   large-scale deployment. 
	</t>

	<t><xref target="RFC3692"/> considers assigning experimental and testing numbers
   useful; having a reserved IPv6 prefix enables this practice. The present
	document follows the guidelines provided in 
	<xref target="RFC3692"/>, with one exception.
	<xref target="RFC3692"/> suggests the use of values similar to
	those called "Private Use" in <xref target="RFC5226"/>, which
	by definition are not unique. One purpose of the
	present request to IANA is to guarantee uniqueness to the EID
	block. The lack thereof would result in a lack of real utility
	of a reserved IPv6 prefix.
 	</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Expected Use" anchor="usage">
      
	<t>Sites planning to deploy LISP may request a prefix in the
	IPv6 EID block. Such prefixes will be used for routing and
	endpoint identification inside the site requesting
	it. Mappings related to such a prefix, or part of it, will be
	made available through the mapping system in use and registered
	to one or more Map-Server(s). 
	</t>

	<t>The EID block must be used for LISP experimentation and
	must not be advertised in the form of more specific route
	advertisements in the non-LISP inter-domain routing
	environment. 
	Interworking between the EID block sub-prefixes and the
	non-LISP Internet is done according to the techniques described in
	<xref target="RFC6832"/> and 
	<xref target="RFC7215"/>. 
	</t>

	<t>As the LISP adoption progresses, the EID block may
	potentially have a reduced impact on the BGP routing
	infrastructure, compared to the case of having the same 
	number of adopters using global unicast space allocated by Regional
	Internet Registries (RIRs) 
	(<xref target="MobiArch2007"/>).
	From a short-term perspective, the EID block offers
	potentially large aggregation capabilities since it is
	announced by Proxy Tunnel Routers (PxTRs), possibly concentrating several contiguous
	prefixes. This trend should continue with even lower impact from a
	long-term perspective, because more aggressive aggregation can be
	used, potentially leading to using fewer PxTRs announcing the whole
	EID block (<xref target="FIABook2010"/>).
	</t>

	<t>The EID block will be used only at the configuration level, so it
	is recommended not to hard-code the IPv6 EID block
	in the router hardware in any way. This prevents locking out
	sites that may want to switch to LISP while keeping their own
	IPv6 prefix, which is not in the IPv6 EID block. Furthermore,
	in the case of a future permanent allocation, the allocated
	prefix may differ from the experimental temporary prefix
	allocated during the experimentation phase.
	</t>

	<t>With the exception of the Proxy Ingress Tunnel Router (PITR) case (described in 
	<xref target="routing"/>),
	prefixes out of the EID block must not be announced
	in the BGP routing infrastructure.  
	</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Block Dimension" anchor="size">

	<t> 
	  The working group reached consensus on an initial allocation
	  of a /32 prefix. The reason of such consensus is manifold:

	  <list hangIndent="2" style="symbols">

	    <t>
	      The working group agreed that the /32 prefix is sufficiently
	      large to cover initial allocation and requests for
	      prefixes in the EID space in the next few years for very
	      large-scale experimentation and deployment.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      As a comparison, it is worth mentioning that the current
	      LISP Beta Network (<xref target="BETA"/>) is using a /32
	      prefix, with more than 250 sites using a /48 sub-prefix. 
	      Hence, a /32 prefix appears sufficiently large to allow
	      the current deployment to scale up and be open for
	      interoperation with independent deployments using 
	      the EIDs in the new /32 prefix.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      A /32 prefix is sufficiently large to allow deployment
	      of independent (commercial) LISP-enabled networks by
	      third parties, but may as well boost LISP
	      experimentation and deployment. 
	    </t>

	    <t> 
	      The use of a /32 prefix is in line with previous similar
	      prefix allocation for tunneling protocols (<xref
	      target="RFC3056"/>).
	    </t>

	  </list>

	</t>

      </section>  

      <section title="3+3 Allocation Plan" anchor="plan">

	<t>Per this document, IANA has initially assigned a /32
	prefix out of the IPv6 addressing space for use as EID in LISP.
	</t>
 
	<t> IANA allocated the requested address space in
	August 2016 for a duration of 3 (three) years 
	(through August 2019), with an option to extend this period
	by 3 (three) more years (until August 2022). By the end of
	the first period, the IETF will provide a decision on whether
	to transform the prefix into a permanent assignment or to put it
	back in the free pool (see <xref target="permanent"/> for more 
	information).
	</t>

	<t>
	  In the first case, i.e., if the IETF decides to transform
	  the block into a permanent allocation, the EID block
	  allocation period will be extended for three years (until
	  August 2022) to give the IETF time to define the
	  final size of the EID block and create a transition
	  plan. The transition of the EID block into a permanent
	  allocation might pose policy issues (as
	  recognized in <xref target="RFC2860"/>, Section 4.3);
	  therefore, discussion with the IANA, the RIR communities, and the
	  IETF community will be necessary to determine the appropriate
	  policy for permanent EID-block allocation and management.
	  Note as well that the final permanent allocation may differ
	  from the initial experimental assignment; hence, it is
	  recommended not to hard-code the experimental EID
	  block on LISP-capable devices in any way.
	</t> 

	<t>In the latter case, i.e., if the IETF decides to terminate the
	experimental-use EID block, all temporary
	prefix allocations in this address range must expire and be
	released by August 2019, so that the entire /32 is returned
	to the free pool.
	</t>

	<t> The allocation and management of the EID block for
	the initial 3-year period (and the optional 3 more years)
	is detailed in 
	<xref target="RFC7955"/>.
	</t>

      </section>
	
	<section title="Allocation Lifetime" anchor="permanent">

	<t>If no explicit action is carried out by the end of the 
	experiment (by August 2019), it is automatically considered that 
	there was not sufficient interest in having a permanent allocation;
	therefore, the address block will be returned to the free pool.
	</t>

	<t>Otherwise, if the LISP working group recognizes that there is 
	value in having a permanent allocation, then explicit action
	is needed.
	</t>
	
	<t>In order to trigger the process for a permanent allocation, 
	a document is required. 
	Such a document has to articulate the rationale 
	for why a permanent allocation would be beneficial. More specifically,
	the document has to detail the experience gained during 
	experimentation and all of the technical benefits provided 
	by the use of a LISP-specific prefix. Such technical benefits 
	are expected to lay in the scenarios described in 
	<xref target="rationale"/>.  However, new and unforeseen benefits 
	may appear during experimentation. The description should be
	sufficiently articulate that the needed size of the permanent
	allocation can be estimated. However, note that, as explained in <xref target="plan"/>, it 
	is up to IANA to decide which address block will be used as a
	permanent allocation and that such a block may be different from
	the temporary experimental allocation.     
	</t> 
	
	</section>


      <section title="Routing Considerations" anchor="routing">

	<t>In order to provide connectivity between the Legacy
	Internet and LISP sites, PITRs announcing large aggregates
	(ideally one single, large aggregate) of the IPv6 EID block
	could be deployed. By doing so, PITRs will attract traffic
	destined for LISP sites in order to encapsulate and forward it
	toward the specific destination LISP site. 
	Routers in the Legacy Internet must treat announcements of
	prefixes from the IPv6 EID block as normal announcements,
	applying best current practices for traffic engineering and
	security. 
	</t>

	<t>Even in a LISP site, not all routers need to run LISP
	elements. In particular, routers that are not at the border of
	the local domain, used only for intra-domain routing, do not
	need to provide any specific LISP functionality but must be
	able to route traffic using addresses in the IPv6 EID block.
	</t>
	
	<t>For the above-mentioned reasons, routers that do not run
	any LISP element must not include any special handling code
	or hardware for addresses in the IPv6 EID block. 
	In particular, it is recommended that the default router
	configuration not handle such addresses in any special
	way. 
	Doing differently could prevent communication between the
	Legacy Internet and LISP sites or even break local
	intra-domain connectivity.

	The reserved address space is requested for an initial 3-year period

	(until August 2022) upon the decision of the IETF (see Sections
	<xref target="plan" format="counter"/> and <xref target="permanent" format="counter"/>).
	Following the policies outlined in <xref target="RFC5226"/>, 
	upon IETF Review, the decision should be made on
	whether to have a permanent EID block assignment by August 2019.
	If no explicit action is taken or, if the IETF Review
