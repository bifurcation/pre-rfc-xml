This document provides an overview of a workshop held by the Internet
Architecture Board (IAB) on Internet Technology Adoption and
Transition (ITAT).  The workshop was hosted by the University of
Cambridge on December 4th and 5th of 2013 in Cambridge, UK.  The goal
of the workshop was to facilitate adoption of Internet protocols,
through examination of a variety of economic models, with particular
emphasis at the waist of the hourglass (e.g., the middle of the protocol stack). 


 This report summarizes
contributions and discussions.  As the topics were wide ranging, there
is no single set of recommendations for IETF participants to pursue at
this time.  Instead, in the classic sense of early research, the
workshop noted areas that deserve further exploration.
</t>
<t>
Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of the
workshop.  The views and positions documented in this report are
those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB
views and positions.

  <section title="Introduction">
    <t>
      The Internet is a complex ecosystem that encompasses all aspects
      of society.  At its heart is a protocol stack with an hourglass
      shape, and IP at its center.  Recent research points to possible
      explanations for the success of such a design and for the
      significant challenges that arise when trying to evolve or
      change its middle section, e.g., as partially evident in the
      difficulties encountered by IPv6.  The workshop had a number of
      other key examples to consider, including the next generation of
      HTTP and real time web-browser communications (WebRTC).  The
      eventual success of many if not all of these protocols will
      largely depend on our understanding of not only what features
      and design principles contribute lasting value, but also how
      deployment strategies can succeed in unlocking that value to
      foster protocol adoption.  The latter is particularly important
      in that most if not all Internet protocols exhibit strong
      externalities that create strong barriers to adoption,
      especially in the presence of a well-established incumbent.
      That is, factors beyond the control of the end points (such as
      middleboxes) can limit deployment, sometimes by design.
      </t>
      <t>
      The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops
designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the
Internet, and to suggest future directions for the Internet
architecture.  This long-term planning function of the IAB is
complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working
groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), under the
leadership of the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) and area
directorates.
</t>
<t>
      Taking into account <xref target="RFC5218" /> on
      what makes a protocol successful, this workshop sought to
      explore how the complex interactions of protocols' design and
      deployment affect their success.  One of the workshop's goals
      was, therefore, to encourage discussions to develop an
      understanding of what makes protocol designs successful not only
      in meeting initial design goals but more importantly in their
      ability to evolve as these goals and the available technology
      change.  Another equally important goal was to develop protocol
      deployment strategies that ensure that new features can rapidly
      gain enough of a foothold to ultimately realize broad adoption.
      Such strategies must be informed by both operational
      considerations and economic factors.
    </t>
    <t>
      Participants in this workshop consisted of operators, researchers
      from the fields of computer science and economics, and
      engineers.  Contributions were wide ranging.  As such, this
      report makes few recommendations for the IETF to
      consider.</t>
  <section title="Organization of This Report">
    <t>This report records the participants' discussions.  At the end,
    workshop participants reviewed potential follow-up items.  These will
    be highlighted at each point during the report, and a summary is

  </section>
  <section title="Motivations and Review of Existing Work" anchor="motivations">
      <t>Our workshop began with an introduction that asks the
      question: is the neck of the Internet hourglass closed for
      business?  There are numerous instances where progress has been
      slow, the three biggest that come to mind
      being <xref target="RFC2480">IPv6</xref>, <xref target="RFC4960">the
      Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)</xref>,
      and <xref target="RFC4034">DNS Security (DNSSEC)</xref>.

 The impact
      of DNSSEC is of particular interest, because it is relied upon for the
      delivery of other services, such
      as <xref target="RFC6698">DNS-Based Authentication
              of Named Entities (DANE)</xref>, and it could be used for
      application discovery services through DNS (specifically where
      security properties are part of that discovery).  Thus, slowdown
      at the neck of the glass can have an impact closer to the lip.
    </t>
    <t>Even when one considers the classic neck of the hourglass to be IP
      and transport layers, it was suggested that the hourglass might
      extend as high as the application layer.
    </t>
    <figure title="HTTP(s) as the new neck?">

</figure>
    <t>
      This idea was rebutted by the argument that protocols do
      continue to evolve, that protocols like SMTP and IMAP in the
      applications space have continued to evolve, as has the
      transport layer. 
    </t>
    <t>
      The workshop moved on to a review of RFC 5218, which
      discusses protocol success factors.  This work was presented in
      the IETF 70 plenary and was the basis for this
      ongoing work.  There were two clear outcomes from the
      discussion.  The first was that the Internet Architecture
      Board should review and consider that document in the context
      of evaluating Birds of a Feather (BoF) session proposals at the
      IETF, so that any working group proposal is carefully crafted to
      address a specific design space and provide positive net value.
      Another aspect was to continue work on tracking the
      value-specific works in terms of success, wild success, or
      failure. 
      On that last point, failure remains difficult to judge,
      particularly at the neck of the hourglass.
    </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Economics of Protocol Adoption" anchor="economics">
    <t>Several papers were presented that looked at economic aspects of
      protocol adoption.
    </t>
    <section title="When can bundling help adoption of network
		    technologies or services?">
    <t>
      Economics of bundling is a long-studied field, but not as
      applied to protocols.  It is relevant to the IETF and inherent
      to two key notions: layering and "mandatory to implement".  Two
      current examples include DANE atop DNSSEC and WebRTC atop SCTP.

   The workshop reviewed a model <xref target="Weber13"/> that explores how bundling
of two technologies may lead
   to increased or decreased adoption of one or both.  This will depend
on a number of factors, including
   costs, benefits, and externalities associated with each technology.

   (Simply put, an externality is an effect or use decision
      by one set of parties that has either a positive or negative
      impact on others who did not have a choice or whose interests
      were not taken into account.)  Bundling of capabilities may
      provide positive value when individual capabilities on their own
      do not provide sufficient critical mass to propel
      further adoption.  Specifically, bundling can help when one
      technology does not provide positive value until critical mass
      of deployment exists, and where a second technology has low
      adoption cost and immediate value and hence drives initial
      adoption until enough of a user base exists to allow critical
      mass sufficient for the first technology to get positive value.
      One question was what happens where one technology depends on
      the other.  That is directly tied to "mandatory to implement"
      discussions within the IETF.  That is a matter for follow-on
      work.  IETF participants can provide researchers anecdotal
      experience to help improve models in this area.
    </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Internet Protocol Adoption: Learning from Bitcoin">
    <t>The workshop considered an examination of protocol success
      factors in the 
      context of Bitcoin <xref target="Boehme13"/>.  Here, there were
      any number of barriers to success, including adverse press,
      legal uncertainties, glitches and breaches, previous failed
      attempts, and speculative attacks.  Bitcoin has
      thus far overcome these barriers thanks to several key factors:
    </t>
    <t>
      <list style="symbols">
	<t>First, there is a built-in reward system for early
	  adopters.  Participants are monetarily rewarded at an
	  exponentially declining rate.</t>
	<t>There exist exchanges or conversion mechanisms to directly
	  convert Bitcoin to other currencies.</t>
	<t>Finally, there is some store of value in the currency
	  itself, e.g., people find intrinsic value in it.
	</t>
      </list>
    </t>
    <t>The first two of these factors may be transferable to other
      approaches.  One key protocol success factor is direct
      benefit to the participant.  Another key protocol success factor
      is the ability to interface with other systems for mutual benefit.
      In the context of Bitcoin, there has to be a way to exchange the
      coins for other currencies.  The Internet email system had
      simpler adaption mechanisms to allow interchange with
      non-Internet email systems; this facilitated its success.  Another
      more simply stated approach is "IP over everything".
    </t>
    <t>
      A key message from this presentation is that if a protocol
      imposes externalities or costs on other systems, find a means
      to establish incentives for those other players for
      implementation. As it happens, there is a limited example that is directly relevant to
      the IETF.
    </t>
  </section>


  <section title="Long term strategy for a successful deployment of
		DNSSEC - on all levels">
    <t>The workshop reviewed the approach Sweden's .SE registry has
      taken to improving deployment of
      DNSSEC <xref target="Lowinder13"/>.  .SE has roughly 1.5 million
      domains.  IIS (&lt;https://www.iis.se&gt;) manages the ccTLD
      (Country Code Top Level Domain).

  They made the decision to
      encourage deployment of DNSSEC within .SE.  They began by
      understanding what the full ecosystem looked like, who their
      stakeholders were, and the financial, legal, and technical
      aspects to deployment.  As they began their rollout, they
      charged extra for DNSSEC.  As they put it, this didn't work very
      well.
    </t>
    <t>They went on to fund development of OpenDNSSEC to remove
      technical barriers to deployment at end sites, noting that
      tooling was lacking in this area.  Even with this development,
      more tooling is necessary, as they point out a need for APIs
      between the signing zone and the registrar.
    </t>
    <t>To further encourage deployment, the government of Sweden
      provided financial incentives to communities to see that their
      domains were signed.  .SE further provided an incentive to
      registrars to see that their domains were signed.  In summary,
      .SE examined all the players and provided incentives for each to
      participate.
    </t>
    <t>The workshop discussed whether or not this model could be
      applied to other domains.  .SE was in a position to effectively
      subsidize DNS deployment because of their ability to set prices.
      This may be appropriate for certain other top-level domains, but
      it was pointed out that the margins of other domains do not
      allow for a cost reduction to be passed on at this point in
      time.
    </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Framework for analyzing feasibility of Internet
		  protocols">
    <t>One of the goals of the workshop was to provide ways to
      determine when work in the IETF was likely to lead to adoption.
      The workshop considered an interactive approach that combines value net
      analysis, deployment environment analysis, and technical
      architecture analysis that leads to feasibility and solution
      analysis <xref target="Leva13"/>.  This work provided an alternative to RFC 5218 that
      had many points in common.  The case study examined was that of
      Multipath TCP (MPTCP).  Various deployment challenges were observed.  First and
      foremost, increasing bandwidth within the network seems to
      decrease the attractiveness of MPTCP.  Second, the benefit/cost
      tradeoff by vendors was not considered attractive.  Third, not
      all parties may agree on the benefits.</t>

<t>
   Solutions analysis suggested several approaches to improve
   deployment, including using open-source software, lobbying 
   various implementers, deploying proxies, and completing 
   implementations by parties that own both ends of a connection.
  </t>

  </section>
  <section title="Best Effort Service as a Deployment Success Factor">
    <t>
      When given the choice between vanilla and chocolate, why not
      choose both?  The workshop considered an approach that became a recurring
      theme throughout the workshop -- to not examine when it was
      necessary to make a choice between technologies, but rather to
      implement multiple mechanisms to achieve
      adoption <xref target="Welzl13"/>.  The workshop discussed the
      case of Skype, where it will use the best available transport
      mechanism to improve communication between clients, rather than
      tie fate to any specific transport.  The argument goes that
      such an approach provides a means to introduce new transports
      such as SCTP.  This would be an adaptation
      of <xref target="RFC6555">"Happy Eyeballs"</xref>.
    </t>
  </section>
  </section>
  <section title="Innovative / Out-There Models" anchor="innovative">
    <t>There were several approaches presented that examined how we look
      at protocol adoption.
    </t>
    <section title="On the Complexity of Designed Systems (and its effect
		    on protocol deployment)">
      <t>The workshop reviewed a comparison between the hourglass model and what
	systems biologists might call the bow tie
	model <xref target="Meyer13"/>.  The crux of this comparison is
	that both rely on certain building blocks to accomplish a
	certain end.  In the case of our hourglass model, IP sits
	notably in the center, whereas in the case of systems biology,
	adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the means by which all
	organisms convert nutrients to usable energy, and thus resides
	centrally within the biological system.</t>
      <t>
	The workshop also examined the notion of "robust yet fragile", which
	examines the balance between the cost of implementing robust
	systems versus their value.  That is, highly efficient systems
	can prove fragile in the face of failure or may prove hard to
	evolve.
      </t>
      <t>The key question asked during this presentation was how we
	could apply what has been learned in systems biology or what do
	the findings reduce to for engineers?  The answer was that
	more work is needed.  The discussion highlighted the
	complexity of the Internet in terms of predicting network
	behavior.  As such, one promising area to examine may be that
	of network management.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Managing Diversity to Manage Technological
		    Transition">
      <t>The workshop considered the difference between planned versus unplanned
	technology transitions <xref target="Kohno13"/>.  They examined
	several transitions at the link, IP, and application layers in
	Japan.  One key claim in the study is that there is a phase
	difference in the diversity trend between each layer.  The
	statistics presented show that indeed HTTP is the predominant
	substrate for other applications.  Another point made was that
	"natural selection" is a strong means to determine technology.
      </t>
    <t>Along these lines, there were two papers submitted that examined
      the formation and changes to the hourglass in the context of
      evolutionary economics.  Unfortunately, the presenter was unable
      to attend due to illness.  The work was discussed at the
      workshop, and there were different points of view as to the
      approach.
    </t>
    </section>
<section title="On Economic Models of Network Technology Adoption,
  Design, and Viability">
<t>The workshop considered how network protocol capabilities enable certain
  sorts of services that are beneficial to consumers and service
  providers.  This model looks at smart data pricing (SDP) in which
  some behavior is desired and rewarded through a pricing
  model <xref target="Sen13"/>. The example given was use of
  time-dependent pricing (TDP) and demonstrated how a service provider
  was able to load shift traffic to off-peak periods.  Explicit
  Congestion Notification (ECN) and RADIUS were used by the project
  alongside a simple GUI.  This sort of work may prove useful to
  service providers as caching models evolve over time.  The question
  within the room was how will protocol developers consider these sorts
  of requirements.
</t>
</section>
</section>
<section title="Making Standards Better" anchor="making_better">
<t>There were several papers that focused on how standards are
  produced.
</t>

<section title="Standards: a love/hate relationship with patents">
<t>One of the biggest barriers to deployment is that of the unseen
  patent by the non-practicing entity (NPE) <xref target="Lear13"/>.
  While this problem is relatively well understood by the industry,
  the discussion looked at patents as a means to improve
  interoperability.  Those who hold patents have the ability to
  license them in such a way that a single approach towards
  standardization is the result (e.g., they get to decide the venue for
  their work).
</t>
</section>
<section title="Bridge Networking Research and Internet
		Standardization: Case Study on Mobile Traffic
		Offloading and IPv6 Transition Technologies">
  <t>There was a presentation and discussion
     about the gap between the research community and standards
     organizations.  Two cases were examined: mobile offloading and
     IPv6 transition technologies <xref target="Ding13"/>. In the case
     of mobile offloading, a mechanism was examined that required
     understanding of both 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) and IETF standards.  Resistance in
     both organizations was encountered.  In the 3GPP, the problem was
     that the organization already had an offloading model in play.
     In the IETF, the problem was a lack of understanding of the
     interdisciplinary space.  The researchers noted that in the case
     of the IETF, they may have taken the wrong tack by having jumped
     into the solution without having fully explained the problem they
     were trying to solve.  In the case of IPv6 transition
     technologies, researchers encountered a crowded field and not much
     appetite for new transition technologies.
  </t>
  <t>The workshop discussed whether the standards arena is the best
     venue or measurement of success for researchers.  The IRTF is
     meant to bridge academic research and the IETF.  As we will
     discuss below, several avenues for continued dialog are
     contemplated.
  </t>
</section>
<section title="An Internet Architecture for the Challenged">
<t>The workshop engaged in a very provocative discussion about whether the existing
  Internet architecture serves the broadest set of needs.  Three
  specific aspects were examined: geographic, technical, and
  socioeconomic.  Researchers presented an alternative hourglass or
  protocol architecture known as Lowest Common Denominator Networking
  (LCDNet) that re-examines some of the base assumptions of the
  existing architecture, including its "always on"
  nature <xref target="Sathiaseelan13"/>.
</t>
<t>The workshop questioned many of the baseline assumptions of the
  researchers.  In part, this may have been due to constrained
  discussion time on the topic, where a fuller explanation was
  warranted.
</t>
</section>
</section>
<section title="Other Challenges and Approaches" anchor="other_challenges">
<t>The workshop held a number of other discussions about different approaches to
  technology adoption.  We should highlight that a number of papers
  were submitted to the workshop on routing security, two of which
  were not possible to present.
</t>
<section title="Resilience of the commons: routing security">
<t>The workshop discussed a presentation on the tragedy of the commons in the
   context of global inter-domain
   routing <xref target="Robachevsky13"/>.  The "Internet Commons" is a
   collection of networks that we depend on but do not control.  The
   main threat to the commons in the context of BGP is routing
   pollution, or unwanted or unnecessary routing entries.  The
   Internet Society has been working with service providers to improve
   resiliency by driving a common understanding of both problem and
   solution space and by developing a shared view with regard to risk
   and benefits, with the idea being that there would be those who
   would engage in reciprocal cooperation with the hopes that others
   would do similarly in order to break the tragedy.
</t>
<t>What was notable in discussion was that there was no magic bullet
  to addressing the resiliency issue, and that this was a matter of
  clearly identifying the key players and convincing them that their
  incentives were aligned.  It also involved developing approaches to
  measure resiliency.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Getting to the Next Version of TLS">
<t>Originally, the workshop had planned to look at the question of
  whether the IETF could mandate stronger security.  This evolved into a
  discussion about getting to the next version of Transport Layer
  Security (TLS) and what challenges lie ahead.  It was pointed out
  that there were still many old versions of TLS in existence today,
  due to many old implementations.  In particular, it was pointed out
  that a substantial amount of traffic is still encrypted using Triple
  DES.
</t>
<t>One concern about the next generation is that perfect could become
  the enemy of good.  Another point that was made was that perhaps a
  testing platform might help interoperability.  Finally, there was
  some discussion about how new versions of TLS get promoted.
  </t>
</section>
</section>
<section title="Outcomes" anchor="outcomes">
<t>
This wide-ranging workshop discussed many aspects that go to the
success or failure of the work of the IETF.  While there is no single
silver bullet that we can point to for making a protocol successful,
the workshop did discuss a number of outcomes and potential next
steps.
</t>
<section title="Work for the IAB and the IETF">
<t>
The IAB's role in working group formation consists of providing
guidance to the IESG on which Birds of a Feather sessions should be
held, reviewing proposed working group charters, and shepherding some
work so that it can reach a suitable stage for standardization.  In
each of these stages, the IAB has an opportunity to apply the lessons
of RFC 5218, as well as other work such as the notion of bundling
choices, when members give advice.
</t>
<t>In addition to working group creation, the IAB has an opportunity
  to track and present protocol success stories, either through wikis
  or through discussion at plenary sessions.  For instance, at the time of
  writing, there is
  much interest in Bitcoin, its success,
  and what parallels and lessons can be drawn.  Specifically, it would
  be useful to track examples of first-mover advantages.
</t>
<t>Finally, one area that the IETF may wish to consider, relating
  specifically to DNSSEC, as raised by our speakers was
  standardization of the provisioning interface of DNSSEC (DS keys)
  between parent and child zone.  Contributions in this area would be
  welcome.

<section title="Potential for the Internet Research Task Force">
<t>
There are at least two possible activities that the IRTF might wish to
consider.  The first would be a research group that considers
protocol alternatives and recommendations that might be useful in
areas where environments are constrained, due to bandwidth or other
resources.  Such a group has already been proposed, in fact.
</t>
<t>
The second possibility is a more general group that focuses on
economic considerations relating to Internet protocol design.  In
particular, there were a number of areas that were presented to the
working group that deserve further investigation and could use
collaboration between researchers, engineers, and operators.  Two
examples are work on bundling and systems biology.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Opportunities for Others">
<t>
  Incentive models often involve many different players.  As we
  considered work in the workshop, our partners such as ICANN and the
  Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) can continue to play a role in encouraging deployment of
  protocols through their policies.  Their members can also
  participate in any activity of the IRTF that is related to this
  work.
</t>
<t>Specifically, RIRs have a specific role to play in encouraging
  security of the routing system, and ICANN has a specific role to
  play in securing the domain name service.
</t>
<t>The suggestion was made that the IETF working groups could 
leverage graduate students in many universities around the world 
in helping review documents (Internet-Drafts, RFCs, etc.). This would serve as a
source of education in real-world processes to students and would
engage the research community in IETF processes more thoroughly; it
would also provide a scale-out resource for handling
the IETF review workload. Several attendees who have such students
  were prepared to try this out.

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
This document does not discuss a protocol.  Security for the workshop
itself was excellent.
