      <t>This document describes the issues surrounding the timing of
      events in the rolling of a key in a DNSSEC-secured zone. It
      presents timelines for the key rollover and explicitly
      identifies the relationships between the various parameters
      affecting the process. </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <section title="Key Rolling Considerations">
        <t>When a zone is secured with DNSSEC, the zone manager must
        be prepared to replace ("roll") the keys used in the signing
        process. The rolling of keys may be caused by compromise of
        one or more of the existing keys, or it may be due to a
        management policy that demands periodic key replacement for
        security or operational reasons. In order to implement a key
        rollover, the keys need to be introduced into and removed from
        the zone at the appropriate times. Considerations that must be
        taken into account are: </t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">

            <t>DNSKEY records and associated information (such as the
            DS records or RRSIG records created with the key)
            are not only held at the authoritative
            nameserver, they are also cached by resolvers. The
            data on these systems can be interlinked, e.g., a
            validating resolver may try to validate a signature
            retrieved from a cache with a key obtained separately.</t>

            <t>Zone "bootstrapping" events, where a zone is signed
            for the first time, can be common in configurations where
            a large number of zones are being served. Procedures
            should be able to cope with the introduction of keys into
            the zone for the first time as well as "steady-state",
            where the records are being replaced as part of normal
            zone maintenance.</t>

            <t> To allow for an emergency re-signing of the zone as
            soon as possible after a key compromise has been detected,
            standby keys (additional keys over and above those used
            to sign the zone) need to be present. </t>

            <t>A query for the DNSKEY RRset returns all DNSKEY records in
            the zone. As there is limited space in the UDP packet (even
            with EDNS0 support), key records no longer needed must be
            periodically removed. (For the same reason, the number of
            standby keys in the zone should be restricted to the
            minimum required to support the key management
            policy.)</t>

          </list>
        </t>

        <t>Management policy, e.g., how long a key is used for, also
        needs to be considered. However, the point of key management
        logic is not to ensure that a rollover is completed at a
        certain time but rather to ensure that no changes are made to
        the state of keys published in the zone until it is "safe" to
        do so ("safe" in this context meaning that at no time during
        the rollover process does any part of the zone ever go
        bogus). In other words, although key management logic enforces
        policy, it may not enforce it strictly.</t>

        <t>A high-level overview of key rollover can be found in
        <xref target="RFC6781"/>.  In contrast,
        this document focuses on the low-level timing detail of
        two classes of operations described there, the rollover
        of Zone Signing Keys (ZSKs), and the rollover of Key Signing Keys
        (KSKs).</t>

        <t>Note that the process for the introduction of keys into
        a zone is different from that of rolling a key; see <xref
        target="first_key"/> for more information.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Types of Keys">
        <t>Although DNSSEC validation treats all keys equally, <xref
        target="RFC4033"/> recognizes the broad classification of
        ZSKs and KSKs. A ZSK is
        used to authenticate information within the zone; a KSK is
        used to authenticate the zone's DNSKEY RRset. The main
        implication for this distinction concerns the consistency of
        information during a rollover. </t>

        <t> During operation, a validating resolver must use separate
        pieces of information to perform an authentication. At the
        time of authentication, each piece of information may be in
        its cache or may need to be retrieved
        from an authoritative server. The rollover process needs to
        happen in such a way that
        the information is consistent at all times during the rollover. With a
	ZSK, the information is
        the RRSIG (plus associated RRset) and the DNSKEY. These are
        both obtained from the same zone. In the case of the KSK, the
        information is the DNSKEY and DS RRset with the latter being
        obtained from a different zone. </t>

        <t> Although there are similarities in the algorithms to roll
         ZSKs and KSKs, there are a number of differences.  For this reason,
         the two types of rollovers are described separately.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t> The terminology used in this document is as defined in
        <xref target="RFC4033"/> and <xref target="RFC5011"/>.</t>

        <t>A number of symbols are used to identify times, intervals,
        etc. All are listed in <xref target="list_of_symbols"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Limitation of Scope">
        <t>This document represents current thinking at the time of
        publication. However, the subject matter is evolving and it is
        not possible for the document to be comprehensive. In particular,
        it does not cover:

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Rolling a key that is used as both a ZSK and KSK.</t>
          <t>Algorithm rollovers. Only the rolling of keys of the
          same algorithm is described here: not transitions between
          algorithms.</t>
          <t>Changing TTLs.</t>
        </list>
        </t>

        <t>Algorithm rollover is excluded from the document owing to the need
        for there to be an RRSIG for at least one DNSKEY of each algorithm in
        the DNKEY RRset [RFC4035].  This introduces additional constraints
        on rollovers that are not considered here.  Such considerations do
        not apply where other properties of the key, such as key length,
        are changed during the rollover: the DNSSEC protocol does not impose
        any restrictions in these cases.</t>

        <t>
        Also excluded from consideration is the effect of changing the Time to
        Live (TTL) of records in a zone.  TTLs can be changed at any time,
        but doing so around
        the time of a key rollover may have an impact on event timings.
        In the timelines below, it is assumed that TTLs are constant.
        </t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Rollover Methods">

      <section title="ZSK Rollovers">

        <t>For ZSKs, the issue for the zone operator/signer is to ensure
        that any caching validator that has access to a particular
        signature also has access to the corresponding valid ZSK.</t>

        <t>A ZSK can be rolled in one of three ways:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Pre-Publication: described in <xref target="RFC6781"/>,
            the new key is introduced into the DNSKEY RRset, which
            is then re-signed. This state of
            affairs remains in place for long enough to ensure that
            any cached DNSKEY RRsets
            contain both keys. At that point, signatures created with
            the old key can be replaced by those created with the new
            key. 

            During the re-signing
            process (which may or may not be atomic depending on how
            the zone is managed), it doesn't matter with which key an RRSIG
            record retrieved by a resolver was created; cached copies
            of the DNSKEY RRset will contain both the old and new keys.
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Once the zone contains only signatures
            created with the new key, there is an interval during
            which RRSIG records created with the old key expire from
            caches. After this, there will be no signatures
            anywhere that were created using the old key, and it
            can be removed from the DNSKEY RRset. </t>

            <t>Double-Signature: also mentioned in <xref
            target="RFC6781"/>, this involves introducing the new key
            into the zone and using it to create additional RRSIG
            records; the old key and existing RRSIG records are
            retained. During the period in which the zone is being
            signed (again, the signing process may not be atomic),
            validating resolvers are always able to validate RRSIGs: any
            combination of old and new DNSKEY RRset and RRSIGs allows
            at least one signature to be validated.
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Once the signing process is complete and
            enough time has elapsed to make sure that all validators that
            have the DNSKEY and signatures in cache have both the old
            and new information, the old key and signatures can be
            removed from the zone. As before, during this period any
            combination of DNSKEY RRset and RRSIGs will allow
            validation of at least one signature.</t>

            <t>Double-RRSIG: strictly speaking, the use of the term
            "Double-Signature" above is a misnomer as the method is
            not only double signature, it is also double key as
            well. A true Double-Signature method (here called the
            Double-RRSIG method) involves introducing new signatures
            in the zone (while still retaining the old ones) but not
            introducing the new key.
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Once the signing
            process is complete and enough time has elapsed to ensure
            that all caches that may contain an RR and associated
            RRSIG have a copy of both signatures, the key is
            changed. After a further interval during which the old
            DNSKEY RRset expires from caches, the old signatures are
            removed from the zone.</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>Of the three methods, Double-Signature is conceptually the simplest:
        introduce the new key and new signatures, then approximately one
        TTL later remove the old key and old signatures.  It is also the
        fastest, but suffers from increasing the size of the zone and
        the size of responses.</t>

        <t>Pre-Publication is more complex: introduce the new key,
        approximately one TTL later sign the records, and approximately
        one TTL after that remove the old key. It does however keep the
        zone and response sizes to a minimum.</t>

        <t>Double-RRSIG is essentially
        the reverse of Pre-Publication: introduce the new signatures,
        approximately one TTL later change the key, and approximately
        one TTL after that remove the old signatures. However, it
        has the disadvantage of the Pre-Publication method in terms
        of time taken to perform the rollover, the disadvantage of the
        Double-Signature rollover in terms of zone and response sizes,
        and none of the advantages of either. For these reasons, it
        is unlikely to be used in any real-world situations and so
        will not be considered further in this document.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="KSK Rollovers">

        <t>In the KSK case, there should be no problem with a caching
        validator not having access to a signature created with a valid KSK.
        The KSK is only used for one signature
        (that over the DNSKEY RRset) and both the key and the signature
        travel together.  Instead, the issue is to ensure that the KSK is
        trusted.</t>

        <t>Trust in the KSK is due to either the existence of a
        signed and validated DS record in the parent zone or an
        explicitly configured trust anchor.
        If the former, the rollover algorithm will need
        to involve the parent zone in the addition and removal of DS
        records, so timings are not wholly under the control of the
        zone manager.  If the latter, <xref target="RFC5011"/> timings
        will be needed to roll the keys.  (Even in the case where
        authentication is via a DS record, the zone manager may elect to
        include <xref target="RFC5011"/> timings in the key rolling
        process so as to cope with the possibility that the key has also
        been explicitly configured as a trust anchor.)</t>

        <t>It is important to note that the need to interact with the
        parent does not preclude the
        development of key rollover logic; in accordance with the goal
        of the rollover logic, being able to determine when a state
        change is "safe", the only effect of being dependent on the
        parent is that there may be a period of waiting for the parent
        to respond in addition to any delay the key rollover logic
        requires. Although this introduces additional delays, even
        with a parent that is less than ideally responsive, the only
        effect will be a slowdown in the rollover state
        transitions. This may cause a policy violation, but will not
        cause any operational problems.</t>

        <t>Like the ZSK case, there are three methods for rolling a KSK:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Double-KSK: the new
            KSK is added to the DNSKEY RRset, which is then signed with
            both the old and new key. After waiting for the old RRset
            to expire from caches, the DS record in the parent zone is
            changed. After waiting a further interval for this change
            to be reflected in caches, the old key is removed from the
            RRset.</t>

            <t>Double-DS: the new DS record is published. After
            waiting for this change to propagate into caches, the KSK
            is changed. After a
            further interval during which the old DNSKEY RRset expires
            from caches, the old DS record is removed.</t>

            <t>Double-RRset: the new KSK is added to the DNSKEY RRset,
            which is then signed with both the old and new key, and
            the new DS record is added to the parent zone. After waiting
            a suitable interval for the old DS and DNSKEY RRsets to
            expire from caches, the old DNSKEY and
            DS records are removed.</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>In essence, Double-KSK means that the new KSK is introduced
        first and used to sign the DNSKEY RRset. The DS record is changed,
        and finally the old KSK is removed. It limits interactions with
        the parent to a minimum but, for the duration of the rollover,
        the size of the DNSKEY RRset is increased.</t>

        <t>With Double-DS, the order of operations is the other way
        around: introduce the new DS, change the DNSKEY, then remove
        the old DS. The size of the DNSKEY RRset is kept to a minimum,
        but two interactions are required with the parent.</t>

        <t>Finally, Double-RRset is the fastest way to roll the KSK,
        but has the drawbacks of both of the other methods: a larger
        DNSKEY RRset and two interactions with the parent.</t>

    <section title="Key Rollover Timelines" anchor="rollover_timelines">
      <section title="Key States">
        <t>DNSSEC validation requires both the DNSKEY and information
        created from it (referred to as "associated data" in
        this section).  In the case of validation of an RR, the data
        associated with the key is the corresponding RRSIG.  Where there
        is a need to validate a chain of trust, the associated data is
        the DS record.</t>

        <t>During the rolling process, keys move through different states.
        The defined states are:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="hanging" hangIndent="12">
            <t hangText="Generated">Although keys may be created
            immediately prior to first use, some implementations may find
            it convenient to create a pool of keys in one operation and
            draw from it as required.  (Note: such a pre-generated pool
            must be secured against surreptitious use.) In the timelines
            below, before the first event, the keys are considered to 
            be created but not yet used: they are said to be in the
            "Generated" state.</t>

            <t hangText="Published">A key enters the published state when
            either it or its associated data first appears in the

            been published for long enough to guarantee that copies of
            the key(s) it is replacing (or associated data related to
            that key) have expired from caches.</t>

            <t hangText="Active">The data is starting to be used for
            validation.  In the case of a ZSK, it means that the key is

            the created RRSIGs appear in the zone.  In the case of a KSK,
            it means that it is possible to use it to validate a DNSKEY
            RRset as both the DNSKEY and DS records are present in their
            respective zones.  Note that when this state is entered, it
            may not be possible for validating resolvers to use the data
            for validation in all cases: the zone signing may not have
            finished or the data might not have reached the resolver
            because of propagation delays and/or caching issues. If
            this is the case, the resolver will have to rely on the

            it means that the successor DNSKEY and DS records are
            in place.  In both cases, the key (and its associated

            when all validating resolvers are able to use the new key and
            associated data to validate the zone.  However, until this

            </artwork>
          </figure>
          <t>Event 1: Key N's DNSKEY record is put into the zone,
          i.e., it is added to the DNSKEY RRset, which is then re-signed
          with the currently active KSKs. The time at which this
          occurs is the publication time (Tpub), and the key is
          now said to be published.  Note that the key is not yet used
          to sign records. </t>

          <t>Event 2: Before it can be used, the key must be published
          for long  enough to guarantee that any cached version of the
          zone's DNSKEY RRset includes this key.</t>

          <t>This interval is the publication interval (Ipub) and, for
          the second or subsequent keys in the zone, is given by:</t>
          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Ipub = Dprp + TTLkey</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>Here, Dprp is the propagation delay -- the time taken
          for a change introduced at
          the master to replicate to all nameservers.
          TTLkey is the TTL for
          the DNSKEY records in the zone. The sum is therefore the
          maximum time taken for existing DNSKEY records to expire from
          caches, regardless of the
          nameserver from which they were retrieved.</t>

          <t>(The case of introducing the first ZSK into the zone is
          discussed in <xref target="first_key"/>.)</t>

          <t>After a delay of Ipub, the key is said to be ready and
          could be used to sign records.  The time at which this event
          occurs is key N's ready time (Trdy), which is given
          by:</t>
          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Trdy(N) = Tpub(N) + Ipub</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>Event 3: At some later time, the key starts being used to
          sign RRsets. This point is the activation time (Tact) and after
          this, key N is said to be active.</t>
          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Tact(N) &gt;= Trdy(N)</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>Event 4: At some point thought must be given to its successor
          (key N+1). As with the introduction of the currently active key
          into the zone, the successor key will need to be published at least
          Ipub before it is activated. The publication time of key N+1 depends
          on the activation time of key N: </t>
          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Tpub(N+1) &lt;= Tact(N) + Lzsk - Ipub</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>Here, Lzsk is the length of time for which a ZSK will be
          used (the ZSK lifetime). It should be noted that in the diagrams,
          the actual key lifetime is represented; this may differ slightly from
          the intended lifetime set by key management policy.</t>

          <t>Event 5: While key N is still active, its successor becomes
          ready. From this time onwards, key N+1 could be used to
          sign the zone.</t>

          <t>Event 6: When key N has been in use for an interval equal to
          the ZSK lifetime, it is retired (i.e., it will never again be
          used to generate new signatures) and key N+1 activated and used
          to sign the zone.  This is the retire time of key N (Tret), and is
          given by:</t>

          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Tret(N) = Tact(N) + Lzsk</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>It is also the activation time of the successor key N+1.
          Note that operational considerations may cause key N to remain
          in use for a longer (or shorter) time than the lifetime set
          by the key management policy. </t>

          <t>Event 7: The retired key needs to be retained in the zone
          whilst any RRSIG records created using this key are still
          published in the zone or held in caches. (It is
          possible that a validating resolver could have an old RRSIG
          record in the cache, but the old DNSKEY RRset has expired when it is
          asked to provide both to a client. In this case the DNSKEY
          RRset would need to be looked up again.) This means that
          once the key is no longer used to sign records, it should be
          retained in the zone for at least the retire interval (Iret)
          given by:</t>

          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Iret = Dsgn + Dprp + TTLsig</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>Dsgn is the delay needed to ensure that all existing RRsets
          have been re-signed with the new key.
          Dprp is the propagation delay, required to
          guarantee that the updated zone information has reached all
          slave servers, and TTLsig is the maximum TTL of all the
          RRSIG records in the zone created with the retiring key.</t>

          <t>The time at which all RRSIG records created with this key
          have expired from resolver caches is the dead time (Tdea),
          given by:</t>

          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Tdea(N) = Tret(N) + Iret</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>... at which point the key is said to be dead.</t>

          <t>Event 8: At any time after the key becomes dead, it can
          be removed from the zone's DNSKEY RRset, which must then
          be re-signed with the current KSK. This time is
          the removal time (Trem), given by:</t>
          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Trem(N) &gt;= Tdea(N)</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>... at which time the key is said to be removed.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Double-Signature Method" anchor="zsk_doublesignature">
          <t>In this rollover, a new key is introduced and used to sign the
          zone; the old key and signatures are retained.  Once all cached DNSKEY
          and/or RRSIG information contains copies of the new DNSKEY and RRSIGs

          </figure>
          <t>Event 1: Key N is added to the DNSKEY RRset and is then
          used to sign the zone; existing signatures in the zone are
          not removed. The key is published and active: this is key N's
          activation time (Tact), after which the key is said to be active.</t>

          <t>Event 2: As the current key (key N) approaches the end of
          its actual lifetime (Lzsk), the successor key (key N+1) is
          introduced into the zone and starts being used to sign RRsets:
          neither the current key nor the signatures created with it are
          removed.  The successor key is now also active. </t>

          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Tact(N+1) = Tact(N) + Lzsk - Iret</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>Event 3: Before key N can be withdrawn from the zone, all
          RRsets that need to be signed must have been signed by the
          successor key (key N+1) and any old RRsets that do not
          include the new key or new RRSIGs must have expired from caches.
          Note that the signatures are not replaced: each RRset is
          signed by both the old and new key.</t>

          <t>This takes Iret, the retire interval, given by the
          expression:</t>

          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Iret = Dsgn + Dprp + max(TTLkey, TTLsig)</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>As before, Dsgn is the delay needed to ensure that all
          existing RRsets have been signed with the new key and Dprp is
          the propagation delay, required to guarantee that the updated
          zone information has reached all slave servers.
          The final term (the maximum of
          TTLkey and TTLsig) is the period to wait for key and
          signature data associated with key N to expire from
          caches. (TTLkey is the TTL of the DNSKEY RRset and TTLsig
          is the maximum TTL of all the RRSIG records in the zone
          created with the ZSK. The two may be different: although
          the TTL of an RRSIG is equal to the TTL of the RRs in the
          associated RRset <xref target="RFC4034"/>, the DNSKEY RRset
          only needs to be signed with the KSK.)</t>

          <t>At the end of this interval, key N is said to be
          dead. This occurs at the dead time (Tdea) so:</t>

          <t>

          </t>

          <t>Event 4: At some later time, key N and the signatures
          generated with it can be removed from the zone. This is

          <t>Event 1: Key N is introduced into the zone; it is added
          to the DNSKEY RRset, which is then signed by all
          currently active KSKs. (So at this point, the DNSKEY RRset
          is signed by both key N and its predecessor KSK. If other
          KSKs were active, it is signed by these as well.) This is
          the publication time of key N (Tpub); after this, the key is said to
          be published.</t>

          <t>Event 2: Before it can be used, the key must be published
          for long enough to guarantee that any validating resolver
          that has a copy of the DNSKEY RRset in its
          cache will have a copy of the RRset that includes this key:
          in other words, that any prior cached information about the

            </list>
          </t>

          <t>Event 4: The DS record is published in the parent zone.
          As this is the point at which all information for authentication --
          both DNSKEY and DS record -- is available in the two zones, in
          analogy with other rollover methods, this is called the
          activation time of key N (Tact):</t>

          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Tact(N) = Tsbm(N) + Dreg</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>... where Dreg is the registration delay, the time taken
          after the DS record has been submitted to the parent zone
          manager for it to be placed in the zone. (Parent zones are
          often managed by different entities, and this term accounts
          for the organizational overhead of transferring a
          record. In practice, Dreg will not be a fixed time: instead,
          the end of Dreg will be signaled by the appearance of the DS
          record in the parent zone.)</t>

          <t>Event 5: While key N is active, thought needs to be given
          to its successor (key N+1).  At some time before the
          scheduled end of the KSK lifetime, the successor KSK is
          published in the zone. (As before, this means that the DNSKEY
          RRset is
          signed by all KSKs.) This time is the
          publication time of the successor key N+1, given by:</t>
         <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Tpub(N+1) &lt;= Tact(N) + Lksk - Dreg - IpubC</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>... where Lksk is the actual lifetime of the KSK, and Dreg
          the registration delay.</t>

          <t>Event 6: After an interval IpubC, key N+1
          becomes ready (in that all caches that have a
          copy of the DNSKEY RRset have a copy of this key). This time is
          the ready time of the successor key N+1 (Trdy).</t>

          <t>Event 7: At the submission time of the successor key N+1,
          Tsbm(N+1), the DS
          record corresponding to key N+1 is submitted to
          the parent zone.</t>

          <t>Event 8: The successor DS record is published in the
          parent zone and the current DS record withdrawn. Key N
          is said to be retired and the time at which this occurs
          is Tret(N), given by:</t>

          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Tret(N) = Tsbm(N+1) + Dreg</t>
            </list>
          </t>

           <t>Event 9: Key N must remain in the zone until any
          caches that contain a copy of the DS RRset have a copy containing
          the new DS record. This interval is the
          retire interval, given by:</t>
          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Iret = DprpP + TTLds</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>... where DprpP is the propagation delay in the parent
          zone and TTLds the TTL of a DS record in the parent zone.</t>

          <t>As the key is no longer used for anything, it is said to be dead.
          This point is the dead time (Tdea), given by:</t>
          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Tdea(N) = Tret(N) + Iret</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>Event 10: At some later time, key N is removed from the
          zone's DNSKEY RRset (at the remove time Trem); the key is
          now said to be removed.</t>

        <section title="Double-DS Method">
          <t>In this rollover, the new DS record is published in

          <t>Event 1: The DS RR is submitted to the parent zone for publication.
          This time is the submission time, Tsbm.</t>

          <t>Event 2: After the registration delay, Dreg, the DS
          record is published in the parent zone. This is the
          publication time (Tpub) of key N, given by:</t>

          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Tpub(N) = Tsbm(N) + Dreg</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>As before, in practice, Dreg will not be a fixed time. Instead,
          the end of Dreg will be signaled by the appearance of the DS
          record in the parent zone.</t>

          <t>Event 3: At some later time, any cache that
          has a copy of the DS RRset will have a copy of
          the DS record for key N. At this point, key N, if introduced
          into the DNSKEY RRset, could be used to validate the
          zone. For this reason, this time is known as the ready
          time, Trdy, and is given by:</t>

          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Trdy(N) = Tpub(N) + IpubP</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>IpubP is the publication interval of the DS record
          (in the parent zone) and is given by the expression:</t>

          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>IpubP = DprpP + TTLds</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>... where DprpP is the propagation delay for the parent
          zone and TTLds the TTL assigned to DS records in that
          zone. </t>

          <t>Event 4: At some later time, the key rollover takes
          place and the new key (key N) is introduced into the
          DNSKEY RRset and used to sign it.
          This time is key N's activation time (Tact) and at this
          point key N is said to be active:</t>

          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Tact(N) &gt;= Trdy(N)</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>Event 5: At some point, thought must be given to key
          replacement. The DS record for the successor key must be
          submitted to the parent zone at a time such that when the
          current key is withdrawn, any cache that contains the zone's
          DS records has data about the DS record
          of the successor key. The time at which this occurs is the
          submission time of the successor key N+1, given by:</t>

          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Tsbm(N+1) &lt;= Tact(N) + Lksk - IpubP - Dreg</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>... where Lksk is the actual lifetime of key N (which may differ
          slightly from the lifetime set in the key management policy) and
          Dreg is the registration delay.</t>

          <t>Event 6. After an interval Dreg, the successor DS record is
          published in the zone.</t>

          <t> Event 7: The successor key (key N+1) enters the ready
          state, i.e., its DS record is now in caches that contain the parent
          DS RRset.</t>

          <t>Event 8: When key N has been active for its lifetime (Lksk),
          it is replaced in the DNSKEY RRset by key N+1; the RRset is
          then signed with the new key. At this point, as both the old and
          new DS records have been in the parent zone long enough to ensure
          that they are in caches that contain the DS RRset, the zone
          can be authenticated throughout the rollover. A validating
          resolver can authenticate either the old or new KSK.</t>

          <t>This time is the retire time (Tret) of key N, given by:</t>

          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Tret(N) = Tact(N) + Lksk</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>This is also the activation time of the successor key
          N+1.</t>

          <t>Event 9: At some later time, all copies of the old DNSKEY
          RRset have expired from caches and the old DS record is no
          longer needed. In analogy with other rollover methods, this is
          called the dead time, Tdea, and is
          given by: </t>
          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Tdea(N) = Tret(N) + Iret</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t> ... where Iret is the retire interval of the
          key, given by:</t>
          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Iret = DprpC + TTLkey</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>As before, this term includes DprpC, the time taken to propagate
          the RRset change through the master-slave hierarchy of the child
          zone and TTLkey, the
          time taken for the DNSKEY RRset to expire from caches.</t>

          <t>Event 10: At some later time, the DS record is removed
          from the parent zone. In analogy with other rollover methods,
          this is the removal time (Trem), given
          by:</t>
          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Trem(N) &gt;= Tdea(N)</t>

        <section title="Double-RRset Method">
           <t>In the Double-RRset rollover, the new DNSKEY and DS
           records are published simultaneously in the appropriate

          Event 1: The DS and DNSKEY records have appeared in their respective
          zones and the latter has been used to sign the DNSKEY RRset. The

          into the zone and is used to sign the DNSKEY RRset. At the 
          same time, the successor DS record is submitted to the parent zone.
          This is the publication time of the successor key (Tpub):

          Event 3: After the registration delay (Dreg), the DS record appears
          in the parent zone. The DNSKEY record is already in the child zone,
          so with both the new key and its associated data now visible, this is
          the key's activation time (Tact) and the key is now said to be
          active.

            </list>
          </t>

          <t>
          Event 4: Before key N and its associated data can be withdrawn, all
          RRsets in the caches of validating resolvers must contain the new DS
          and/or DNSKEY. The time at which this occurs is the dead time of
          key N (Tdea), given by:

          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">

          <t>
          Ipub is the time it takes to guarantee that any prior cached
          information about the DNSKEY and the DS RRsets have expired. For the
          DNSKEY, this is the publication interval of the child (IpubC). For
          the DS, the publication interval (IpubP) starts once the record
          appears in the parent zone, which is Dreg after it has been
          submitted. Hence:

          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">

          </t>

          <t>
          The parent zone's publication interval is given by:
          </t>

          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>IpubP = DprpP + TTLds</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>
          where DprpP is the parent zone's propagation delay and TTLds is the
          TTL of the DS record in that zone.
          </t>

          <t>
          The child zone's publication interval is given by a similar equation:
          </t>

          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>IpubC = DprpC + TTLkey</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>
          where DprpC is the propagation delay in the child zone and TTLkey
          the TTL of a DNSKEY record.
          </t>

          <t>
          In analogy with other rollovers, we can also define a retire
          interval -- the interval between a key becoming active and the time
          at which its predecessor is considered dead.  In this case, Iret is
          given by:
          </t>

          <t>
            <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
              <t>Iret = Ipub - Dreg</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>
          In other words, the retire interval of the predecessor key is the
          greater of the publication interval of the parent, or the publication
          interval of the child minus the registration delay.

        <section title="Interaction with Configured Trust Anchors" anchor="trust_anchors">
          <t>Although the preceding sections have been concerned with
          rolling KSKs, where the trust anchor is a DS record in the
          parent zone, zone managers may want to take account of the
          possibility that some validating resolvers may have
          configured trust anchors directly.</t>

          <t>Rolling a configured trust anchor is dealt with in <xref
          target="RFC5011"/>. It requires introducing the KSK to be
          used as the trust anchor into the zone for a period of time
          before use and retaining it (with the "revoke" bit set) for
          some time after use.</t>

          <section title="Addition of KSK">
            <t>When the new key is introduced, the expression for the
            publication interval of the DNSKEY (IpubC) in the Double-KSK
            and Double-RRset methods is modified to:</t>

            <t>
              <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
                <t>IpubC &gt;= DprpC + max(Itrp, TTLkey)</t>
              </list>
            </t>

            <t>... where the right-hand side of the expression now
            includes the "trust point" interval.  This
            term is the interval required to guarantee that
            a resolver configured for the automatic update of keys
            according to <xref target="RFC5011"/> will accept the
            new key as a new trust point.
            That interval is given by:
            </t>

            <t>
              <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
                <t>Itrp &gt;= queryInterval + AddHoldDownTime + queryInterval</t>
              </list>
            </t>

            <t>... where queryInterval is as defined in Section 2.3 of
            <xref target="RFC5011"/> and AddHoldDownTime is the Add Hold-Down
            Time defined in Section 2.4.1 of the same document.</t>

            <t>The first term of the expression (queryInterval) represents
            the time after which all validating resolvers can be guaranteed
            to have obtained a copy of the DNSKEY RRset containing the new key.
            Once retrieved, a validating resolver needs to wait for
            AddHoldDownTime. Providing it does not see a validly signed DNSKEY
            RRset without the new key in that period, it will treat it as a trust
            anchor the next time it retrieves the RRset, a process that can take
            up to another queryInterval (the third term).</t>

            <t>However, the expression for queryInterval given in
            <xref target="RFC5011"/> contains the DNSKEY's RRSIG
            expiration interval, a parameter that only the validating resolver
            can really calculate.  In practice, a modified
            query interval that depends only on TTLkey can be used:</t>

            <t>
              <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
                <t>modifiedQueryInterval = MAX(1hr, MIN(15 days, TTLkey / 2))</t>
              </list>
            </t>

            <t>(This is obtained by taking the expression for queryInterval
            in <xref target="RFC5011"/> and assuming a worst case for
            RRsigExpirationInterval. It is greater than or equal to queryInterval
            for all values of the expiration time.)  The expression above then
            becomes (after collecting terms):</t>

            <t>
              <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
                  <t>Itrp &gt;= AddHoldDownTime + 2 * modifiedQueryInterval</t>
              </list>
            </t>

            <t>In the Double-DS method, instead of swapping the KSK RRs
               in a single step, there must now be a period of overlap.
               In other words, the new KSK must be introduced into the
               zone at least:</t>
            <t>
              <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
                <t>DprpC + max(Itrp, TTLkey)</t>
              </list>
            </t>

            <t>... before the switch is made.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Removal of KSK">
            <t>The timeline for the removal of the key in all methods
            is modified by introducing a new state, "revoked".  When
            the key reaches its dead time, instead of being declared
            "dead", it is revoked; the "revoke" bit is set in the published
            DNSKEY RR, and the DNSKEY RRset re-signed with the current
            and revoked keys.  The key is maintained in this state for the
            revoke interval, Irev, given by:
            </t>

              </list>
            </t>

            <t>As before, DprpC is the time taken for the revoked DNSKEY
            to propagate to all slave zones, and modifiedQueryInterval is
            the time after which it can be guaranteed that all validating
            resolvers that adhere to RFC 5011 have retrieved a copy of the
            DNSKEY RRset containing the revoked key.
            </t>

            <t>After this time, the key is dead and can be removed from the

          <t>There are no timing considerations associated with the

          <t>In the case of a secure parent, it

          corresponding DNSKEY. In the case of an insecure parent,
          i.e., the initial creation of a chain of trust or "security apex",
          it is not possible to guarantee this.  It is up to the
          operator of the validating resolver to wait for the new
          KSK to appear at all servers for the zone before configuring
          the trust anchor.</t>

    <section title="Standby Keys">
      <t> Although keys will usually be rolled according to some
      regular schedule, there may be occasions when an emergency
      rollover is required, e.g., if the active key is suspected of
      being compromised. The aim of the emergency rollover is to allow
      the zone to be re-signed with a new key as soon as possible. As
      a key must be in the ready state to sign the zone, having at
      least one additional key (a standby key) in this state at all
      times will minimize delay. </t>

      <t> In the case of a ZSK, a standby key only really makes sense
      with the Pre-Publication method. A permanent standby DNSKEY RR
      should be included in the zone or successor keys could be introduced
      as soon as possible after a key becomes active. Either way
      results in one or more additional ZSKs in the DNSKEY RRset that can
      immediately be used to sign the zone if the current key is
      compromised.</t>

      <t> (Although, in theory, the mechanism could be used with both
      the Double-Signature and Double-RRSIG methods, it would require
      pre-publication of the signatures. Essentially, the standby key
      would be permanently active, as it would have to be periodically
      used to renew signatures. Zones would also permanently require
      two sets of signatures.) </t>

      <t>It is also possible to have a standby KSK.
      The Double-KSK method requires that the standby KSK be
      included in the DNSKEY RRset; rolling the key then requires just
      the introduction of the DS record in the parent.  Note that the
      standby KSK should also be used to sign the DNSKEY RRset. As the
      RRset and its signatures travel together, merely adding the
      KSK without using it to sign the DNSKEY RRset does not provide
      the desired time saving: for a KSK to be used in a
      rollover, the DNSKEY RRset must be signed with it, and this
      would introduce a delay while the old RRset (not signed with
      the new key) expires from caches.</t>

      <t>The idea of a standby KSK in the Double-RRset
      rollover method effectively means having two active keys (as
      the standby KSK and associated DS record would both be published
      at the same time in their respective zones).
      </t>

      <t>Finally, in the Double-DS method of rolling a KSK, it is not a standby
      key that is present, it is a standby DS record in the parent
      zone.</t>

      <t>Whatever algorithm is used, the standby item of data can
      be included in the zone on a permanent basis, or be a successor
      introduced as early as possible. </t>

    </section>
    <section title="Algorithm Considerations">
      <t>The preceding sections have implicitly assumed that all keys
      and signatures are created using a single algorithm. However,
      Section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC4035"/> requires that there
      be an RRSIG for each RRset using at least one DNSKEY of each
      algorithm in the zone apex DNSKEY RRset.</t>

      <t>Except in the case of an algorithm rollover -- where the
      algorithms used to create the signatures are being changed --
      there is no relationship between the keys of different
      algorithms. This means that they can be rolled independently of
      one another. In other words, the key-rollover logic described
      above should be run separately for each algorithm; the union of
      the results is included in the zone, which is signed using the
      active key for each algorithm.</t>
    </section>


    <section title="Summary">
      <t> For ZSKs, the Pre-Publication method is generally considered to be
      the preferred way of rolling keys. As shown in this document,
      the time taken to roll is wholly dependent on parameters under
      the control of the zone manager.</t>

      <t> In contrast, the Double-RRset method is the most efficient for
      KSK rollover due to the ability to have new DS records and
      DNSKEY RRsets propagate in parallel. The time taken to roll KSKs
      may depend on factors related to the parent zone if the parent
      is signed. For zones that intend to comply with the
      recommendations of <xref target="RFC5011"/>, in many
      cases, the rollover time will be determined by the
      times defined by RFC 5011. It should be emphasized
      that this delay is a policy choice and not a function of timing
      values and that it also requires changes to the rollover process
      due to the need to manage revocation of trust anchors.</t>

      <t>Finally, the treatment of emergency key rollover is
      significantly simplified by the introduction of standby keys as
      standard practice during all types of rollovers. </t>
