    <abstract>
        <t> This specification defines an extension to the multicast addressing
            architecture of the IP Version 4 protocol.  The extension presented
            in this document allows for unicast-prefix-based assignment of
            multicast addresses.  By delegating multicast addresses at the same
            time as unicast prefixes, network operators will be able to 
            identify their multicast addresses without needing to run an 
            inter-domain allocation protocol.

<section title="Introduction">
    <t> RFC 3180 <xref target="RFC3180"/> defines an allocation
        mechanism (called "GLOP") in 233/8
        whereby an Autonomous System (AS) number is embedded in the middle
        16 bits of an IPv4 multicast address, resulting in 256 multicast
        addresses per AS.  Advantages of this mechanism include the ability
        to get multicast address space without an inter-domain multicast
        address allocation protocol, and the ease of determining the AS
        that was assigned the address for debugging and auditing purposes.
    </t>
    <t> Some disadvantages of GLOP include:
    </t>
    <list style="symbols">
        <t> RFC 4893 <xref target="RFC4893"/> expands the 
            size of an AS number to 4 bytes, and GLOP cannot work with 4-byte
            AS numbers.
        </t>
        <t> When an AS covers multiple sites or organizations, administration
            of the multicast address space within an AS must be handled by 
            other mechanisms, such as manual administrative effort or 
            the Multicast Address Dynamic Client Allocation Protocol (MADCAP)
            <xref target="RFC2730"/>.
        </t>
        <t> During debugging, identifying the AS does not immediately identify
            the correct organization when an AS covers multiple organizations.
        </t>
        <t> Only 256 addresses are automatically available per AS, and 
            obtaining any more requires administrative effort.
        </t>
    </list>

    <t> More recently, a mechanism <xref target="RFC3306"/> has been 
        developed for IPv6
        that provides a multicast range to every IPv6 subnet, which is
        at a much finer granularity than an AS.  As a result, the first
        three disadvantages above are avoided (and the last disadvantage
        does not apply to IPv6 due to the extended size of the address space).
    </t>
    <t> Another advantage of providing multicast space to
        a subnet, rather than just to an entire AS, is that
        multicast address assignment within the range need only be coordinated 
        within the subnet.
        <!-- , and hence can be done with zero configuration.
             bidirectional shared tree routing protocols may easily locate
             the direction to the root by doing a route lookup on a unicast 
             address derived from the multicast group address.
         -->
    </t>
    <t> This document specifies a mechanism similar to
        <xref target="RFC3306"/>, whereby a
        range of global IPv4 multicast address space is provided to each
        organization that has unicast address space.
        A resulting advantage over GLOP is that the mechanisms in IPv4 and
        IPv6 become more similar.
    </t>

    <t> This document does not obsolete or update RFC 3180, as the
        mechanism described in RFC 3180 is still required for
        organizations with prefix allocations more specific than /24.
        Organizations using RFC 3180 allocations may continue to do so.
        In fact, it is conceivable that an organization might use both
        RFC 3180 allocations and the allocation method described in
        this document.

        <preamble> 
            A multicast address with the prefix 234/8 indicates that the 
            address is a Unicast-Based Multicast (UBM) address.   The 
            remaining 24 bits are used as follows:
        </preamble>
        <artwork>
Bits:  |   0 thru 7   |         8 thru N        |   N+1 thru 31   |
       +-------+--------------------+-----------------------------+
Value: |     234      |      Unicast Prefix     |    Group ID     |
       +-------+--------------------+-----------------------------+
        </artwork>
    </figure>

    <t> For organizations with a /24 or shorter prefix, the unicast prefix of 
        the organization is appended to the common /8.  Any remaining bits 
        may be assigned by any mechanism the organization wishes.
    </t>
    <t> For example, an organization that has a /16 prefix assigned might 
        choose to assign multicast addresses manually from the /24 
        multicast prefix derived from the above method.  Alternatively,
        the organization might choose to delegate the use of multicast
        addresses to individual subnets that have a /24 or shorter
        unicast prefix, or it might choose some other method.
    </t>
    <t>
        Organizations with a prefix length longer than 24
        do not receive any multicast address space from this mechanism; in
        such cases, another mechanism must be used.
    </t>
    <t> Compared to GLOP, an AS will receive more address space via this 
        mechanism if it has more than a /16 for unicast space.  An AS will 
        receive less address space than it does from GLOP if it has less 
        than a /16.
    </t>
    <t> The organization that is assigned a UBM address can be determined
        by taking the multicast address, shifting it left by 8 bits, and
        identifying who has been assigned the address space covering the
        resulting unicast address.
    </t>
    <t> The embedded unicast prefix MUST be a global unicast prefix
        (i.e., no loopback, multicast, link-local, or private-use IP 
        address space).  In addition, since global unicast addresses are
        not permanently assigned, UBM addresses MUST NOT be hard-coded 
        in applications.
    </t>
</section>

<section title="Examples">
    <t> The following are a few examples of the structure of
        unicast-prefix-based multicast addresses.
        <list style="symbols">
        <t> Consider an organization that has been assigned the global unicast
        address space 192.0.2.0/24.  This means that organization can use
        the global multicast address 234.192.0.2 without coordinating
        with any other entity.  Someone who sees this multicast address and
        wants to find who is using it can mentally shift the address left
        by 8 bits to get 192.0.2.0, and can then look up who has been assigned
        unicast address space that includes that address.
        </t>
        <t> Consider an organization that has been assigned
        a larger address space, x.y.0.0/16.  This organization can use the
        global multicast address space 234.x.y.0/24 without coordinating
        with any other entity, and can assign addresses within this space by
        any mechanism the organization wishes.   Someone who sees a
        multicast address (say) 234.x.y.10 and wants to find who is using
        it can mentally shift the address left by 8 bits to get x.y.10.0,
        and can then look up who has been assigned unicast address space
        that includes that address.
        </t>
        </list>
    </t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">
    <t> The same well-known intra-domain security techniques can be 
        applied as with GLOP.  Furthermore, when dynamic allocation is 
        used within a prefix, the approach described here may have the 
        effect of reduced exposure to denial-of-service attacks, since 
        the topological area within which nodes compete for addresses
        within the same prefix is reduced from an entire AS 
        to only within an individual organization or an even smaller area.
