<abstract><t> 

This document describes the use of loop-free alternates to provide
local protection for unicast traffic in pure IP and MPLS/LDP networks
in the event of a single failure, whether link, node, or shared risk
link group (SRLG). The goal of this technology is to reduce the packet
loss that happens while routers converge after a topology change due
to a failure.  Rapid failure repair is achieved through use of
precalculated backup next-hops that are loop-free and safe to use
until the distributed network convergence process completes.  This
simple approach does not require any support from other routers.  The
extent to which this goal can be met by this specification is
dependent on the topology of the network.  </t></abstract> </front>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">


<t>Applications for interactive multimedia services such as Voice over
  IP (VoIP) and
pseudowires can be very sensitive to traffic loss, such as occurs
when a link or router in the network fails.  A router's convergence
time is generally on the order of hundreds of milliseconds; the
application traffic may be sensitive to losses greater than tens of
milliseconds.</t>

<t>As discussed in <xref target="FRAMEWORK"/>,
minimizing traffic loss requires a mechanism for the router adjacent
to a failure to rapidly invoke a repair path, which is minimally
affected by any subsequent re-convergence.  This specification
describes such a mechanism that allows a router whose local link has
failed to forward traffic to a pre-computed alternate until the router
installs the new primary next-hops based upon the changed network
topology.  The terminology used in this specification is given in
<xref target="FRAMEWORK"/>.  The described
mechanism assumes that routing in the network is performed using a
link-state routing protocol -- OSPF <xref target="RFC2328"/> <xref
target="RFC2740"/> <xref target="RFC5340"/> or
IS-IS <xref target="RFC1195"/> <xref target="RFC2966"/> (for IPv4 or
IPv6).  The mechanism also assumes that both the primary path and the
alternate path are in the same routing area.

</t>

<t>When a local link fails, a router currently must signal the event
to its neighbors via the IGP, recompute new primary next-hops for all
affected prefixes, and only then install those new primary next-hops
into the forwarding plane. Until the new primary next-hops are
installed, traffic directed towards the affected prefixes is
discarded.  This process can take hundreds of milliseconds.</t>

<t> The goal of IP Fast Reroute (IPFRR) is to reduce failure reaction time to
10s of milliseconds by using a pre-computed alternate next-hop, in the
event that the currently selected primary next-hop fails, so that the
alternate can be rapidly used when the failure is detected. A network
with this feature experiences less traffic loss and less micro-looping
of packets than a network without IPFRR. There are cases where
traffic loss is still a possibility since IPFRR coverage varies, but
in the worst possible situation a network with IPFRR is equivalent
with respect to traffic convergence to a network without IPFRR. </t>

<t>To clarify the behavior of IP Fast Reroute, consider the simple
topology in <xref target="Figure_1"/>.  When router S computes its
shortest path to router D, router S determines to use the link to
router E as its primary next-hop.  Without IP Fast Reroute, that link
is the only next-hop that router S computes to reach D. &nbsp;With IP
Fast Reroute, S also looks for an alternate next-hop to use.  In this
example, S would determine that it could send traffic destined to D by
using the link to router N_1 and therefore S would install the link to
N_1 as its alternate next-hop.  At some later time, the link between
router S and router E could fail.  When that link fails, S and E will
be the first to detect it.  On detecting the failure, S will stop
sending traffic destined for D towards E via the failed link, and
instead send the traffic to S's pre-computed alternate next-hop, which
is the link to N_1, until a new SPF is run and its results are
installed.  As with the primary next-hop, an alternate next-hop is
computed for each destination.  The process of computing an alternate
next-hop does not alter the primary next-hop computed via a standard
SPF.</t>

<t>If in the example of <xref target="Figure_1"/>, the link cost from
N_1 to D increased to 30 from 3, then N_1 would not be a loop-free
alternate, because the cost of the path from N_1 to D via S would be
17 while the cost from N_1 directly to D would be 30.  In real
networks, we may often face this situation.  The existence of a
suitable loop-free alternate next-hop is dependent on the topology and
the nature of the failure for which the alternate is calculated.</t>

<t>This specification uses the terminology introduced in <xref
target="FRAMEWORK"/>.  In particular, it uses
Distance_opt(X,Y), abbreviated to D_opt(X,Y), to indicate the shortest
distance from X to Y.  &nbsp;S is used to indicate the calculating router.
N_i is a neighbor of S; N is used as an abbreviation when only one
neighbor is being discussed.  D is the destination under
consideration.</t>

meet a more restrictive condition that is applicable to more complex
failure scenarios:</t>

<section title="Failure Scenarios">

<t>The alternate next-hop can protect against a single link failure, a
single node failure, failure of one or more links within a shared risk
link group, or a combination of these.  
Whenever a failure
occurs that is more extensive than what the alternate was intended to
protect, there is the possibility of temporarily looping traffic (note
again, that such a loop would only last until the next complete SPF
calculation).  The example where a node fails when the alternate
provided only link protection is illustrated below.  If unexpected
simultaneous failures occur, then micro-looping may occur since the
alternates are not pre-computed to avoid the set of failed links.</t>

<t>If only link protection is provided and the node fails, it is
possible for traffic using the alternates to experience
micro-looping. This issue is illustrated in <xref target="Figure_2"/>.
If Link(S->E) fails, then the link-protecting alternate via N will
work correctly. However, if router E fails, then both S and N will
detect a failure and switch to their alternates.  In this example,
that would cause S to redirect the traffic to N and N to redirect the
traffic to S and thus causing a forwarding loop.  Such a scenario can
arise because the key assumption, that all other routers in the
network are forwarding based upon the shortest path, is violated
because of a second simultaneous correlated failure -- another link
connected to the same primary neighbor. If there are not other
protection mechanisms to handle node failure, a node failure is still
a concern when only using link-protecting LFAs. </t>

<t> Micro-looping of traffic via the alternates caused when a more
extensive failure than planned for occurs can be prevented via
selection of only downstream paths as alternates.  A micro-loop due to
the use of alternates can be avoided by using downstream paths because
each succeeding router in the path to the destination must be closer
to the destination than its predecessor (according to the topology
prior to the failures).  Although use of downstream paths ensures that
the micro-looping via alternates does not occur, such a restriction
can severely limit the coverage of alternates.  In <xref
target="Figure_2"/>, S would be able to use N as a downstream
alternate, but N could not use S; therefore, N would have no alternate
and would discard the traffic, thus avoiding the micro-loop. </t>


<t>As shown above, the use of either a node-protecting LFA (described
in <xref target="Node-Protect"/>) or a downstream path provides
protection against micro-looping in the event of node failure.  There
are topologies where there may be either a node-protecting LFA, a
downstream path, both, or neither.  A node may select either a node-protecting LFA or a downstream path without risk of causing
micro-loops in the event of neighbor node failure.  While a
link-and-node-protecting LFA guarantees protection against either link
or node failure, a downstream path provides protection only against a
link failure and may or may not provide protection against a node
failure depending on the protection available at the downstream node,
but it cannot cause a micro-loop. For example, in <xref 
target="Figure_2"/>, if S uses N as a downstream path, although no
looping can occur, the traffic will not be protected in the event of
the failure of node E because N has no viable repair path, and it will
simply discard the packet. However, if N had a link-and-node-protecting LFA or downstream path via some other path (not shown),
then the repair may succeed.</t>

<t>Since the functionality of link-and-node-protecting LFAs is greater
than that of link-protecting downstream paths, a router SHOULD select
a link-and-node-protecting LFA over a link-protecting downstream path.
If there are any destinations for which a link-and-node-protecting LFA
is not available, then by definition the path to all of those
destinations from any neighbor of the computing router (S) must be
through the node (E) being protected (otherwise there would be a node
protecting LFA for that destination). Consequently, if there exists a
downstream path to the protected node as destination, then that
downstream path may be used for all those destinations for which a
link-and-node-protecting LFA is not available; the existence of a
downstream path can be determined by a single check of the condition
Distance_opt(N, E) &lt; Distance_opt(S, E).</t>

<t>It may be desirable to find an alternate that can protect against
other correlated failures (of which node failure is a specific
instance).  In the general case, these are handled by shared risk link
groups (SRLGs) where any links in the network can belong to the SRLG.
General SRLGs may add unacceptably to the computational complexity of
finding a loop-free alternate.</t>

<t>However, a sub-category of SRLGs is of interest and can be applied
only during the selection of an acceptable alternate.  This
sub-category is to express correlated failures of links that are
connected to the same router, for example, if there are multiple
logical sub-interfaces on the same physical interface, such as VLANs
on an Ethernet interface, if multiple interfaces use the same physical
port because of channelization, or if multiple interfaces share a
correlated failure because they are on the same line-card.  This
sub-category of SRLGs will be referred to as local-SRLGs.  A
local-SRLG has all of its member links with one end connected to the
same router.  Thus, router S could select a loop-free alternate that
does not use a link in the same local-SRLG as the primary next-hop.
The failure of local-SRLGs belonging to E can be protected against via
node protection, i.e., picking a loop-free node-protecting
alternate.</t>

<t>Where SRLG protection is provided, it is in the context of the
particular OSPF or IS-IS area, whose topology is used in the SPF
computations to compute the loop-free alternates.  If an SRLG contains
links in multiple areas, then separate SRLG-protecting alternates
would be required in each area that is traversed by the affected
traffic.</t>

<section title="Alternate Next-Hop Calculation">

<t>In addition to the set of primary next-hops obtained through a
shortest path tree (SPT) computation that is part of standard
link-state routing functionality, routers supporting IP Fast Reroute
also calculate a set of backup next-hops that are engaged when a local
failure occurs. These backup next-hops are calculated to provide the
required type of protection (i.e., link-protecting and/or
node-protecting) and to guarantee that when the expected failure
occurs, forwarding traffic through them will not result in a
loop. Such next-hops are called loop-free alternates or LFAs
throughout this specification.</t>
 
<t>In general, to be able to calculate the set of LFAs for a specific
destination D, a router needs to know the following basic pieces of
information:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">	

<t>Shortest-path distance from the calculating router to the
destination (Distance_opt(S, D))</t>
 
<t>Shortest-path distance from the router's IGP neighbors to the
destination (Distance_opt(N, D))</t>
 
<t>Shortest path distance from the router's IGP neighbors to itself
(Distance_opt(N, S))</t>
    
<t>Distance_opt(S, D) is normally available from the regular SPF
calculation performed by the link-state routing
protocols. Distance_opt(N, D) and Distance_opt(N, S) can be obtained
by performing additional SPF calculations from the perspective of each
IGP neighbor (i.e., considering the neighbor's vertex as the root of
the SPT--called SPT(N) hereafter--rather than the calculating
router's one, called SPT(S)). </t>

</list></t>
 
<t>This specification defines a form of SRLG protection limited to
those SRLGs that include a link to which the calculating router is
directly connected.  Only that set of SRLGs could cause a local
failure; the calculating router only computes alternates to handle a
local failure.  Information about local link SRLG membership is
manually configured. Information about remote link SRLG membership may
be dynamically obtained using <xref target="RFC4205"/> or <xref
target="RFC4203"/>.  Define SRLG_local(S) to be the set of SRLGs that
include a link to which the calculating router S is directly connected
Only SRLG_local(S) is of interest during the calculation, but the
calculating router must correctly handle changes to SRLG_local(S)
triggered by local link SRLG membership changes.</t>


<t>In order to choose among all available LFAs that provide required
SRLG protection for a given destination, the calculating router needs
to track the set of SRLGs in SRLG_local(S) that the path through a
specific IGP neighbor involves.  To do so, each node D in the network
topology is associated with SRLG_set(N, D), which is the set of SRLGs
that would be crossed if traffic to D was forwarded through N. &nbsp;To
calculate this set, the router initializes SRLG_set(N, N) for each of
its IGP neighbors to be empty. During the SPT(N) calculation, when a
new vertex V is added to the SPT, its SRLG_set(N, V) is set to the
union of SRLG sets associated with its parents, and the SRLG sets in
SRLG_local(S) that are associated with the links from V's parents to
V. &nbsp;The union of the set of SRLGs associated with a candidate alternate
next-hop and the SRLG_set(N, D) for the neighbor reached via that
candidate next-hop is used to determine SRLG protection.</t>
 
<t>The following sections provide information required for calculation
of LFAs.  Sections <xref target="LFA_Section" format="counter"/> through <xref
target="ECMP_Section" format="counter"/> define different types of LFA conditions.
<xref target="RFC3137_Section"/> describes constraints imposed by the
IS-IS overload and OSPF stub router functionality.  <xref
target="Selection_Section"/> defines the summarized algorithm for LFA
calculation using the definitions in the previous sections.</t>

<t>Alternate next hops used by implementations following this
specification MUST conform to at least the loop-freeness condition

that one of N's paths goes through E, and the calculating router has
no way to influence N's decision to use it.  Therefore, it SHOULD be
assumed that an alternate next-hop does not offer node protection if
Inequality 3 is not met.</t>

<section anchor="Broadcast" title="Broadcast and Non-Broadcast
				   Multi-Access (NBMA) Links">

<t> Verification of the link-protection property of a next-hop in the
case of a broadcast link is more elaborate than for a point-to-point
link.  This is because a broadcast link is represented as a
pseudo-node with zero-cost links connecting it to other nodes.</t>

<t>Because failure of an interface attached to a broadcast segment may
mean loss of connectivity of the whole segment, the condition
described for broadcast link protection is pessimistic and requires
that the alternate is loop-free with regard to the pseudo-node.
Consider the example in <xref target="Figure_3"/>.</t>

<t>In <xref target="Figure_3"/>, N offers a loop-free alternate that
is link-protecting.  If the primary next-hop uses a broadcast link,
then an alternate SHOULD be loop-free with respect to that link's
pseudo-node (PN) to provide link protection.  This requirement is
described in Inequality 4 below.</t>

<figure 
title="Inequality 4: Loop-Free Link-Protecting Criterion for Broadcast Links">
<artwork><![CDATA[
           D_opt(N, D) < D_opt(N, PN) + D_opt(PN, D)
]]></artwork>
</figure>

<t>Because the shortest path from the pseudo-node goes through E, if a
loop-free alternate from a neighbor N is node-protecting, the
alternate will also be link-protecting unless the router S can only
reach the alternate neighbor N via the same pseudo-node. Since this is
the only case for which a node-protecting LFA is not link-protecting,
this implies that for point-to-point interfaces, an LFA that is
node-protecting is always link-protecting.  Because S can direct the
traffic away from the shortest path to use the alternate N, traffic
might pass through the same broadcast link as it would when S sent the
traffic to the primary E. &nbsp;Thus, an LFA from N that is node-protecting
is not automatically link-protecting for a broadcast or NBMA link.</t>

<t>To obtain link protection, it is necessary both that the path from
the selected alternate next-hop does not traverse the link of interest
and that the link used from S to reach that alternate next-hop is not
the link of interest.  The latter can only occur with
non-point-to-point links.  Therefore, if the primary next-hop is
across a broadcast or NBMA interface, it is necessary to consider link
protection during the alternate selection.  To clarify, consider the
topology in <xref target="Figure_3"/>.  For N to provide
link protection, it is first necessary that N's shortest path to D
does not traverse the pseudo-node PN.  Second, it is necessary that
the alternate next-hop selected by S does not traverse PN.  In this
example, S's shortest path to N is via the pseudo-node.  Thus, to
obtain link protection, S must find a next-hop to N (the
point-to-point link from S to N in this example) that avoids the
pseudo-node PN.</t>

<t>Similar consideration of the link from S to the selected alternate
next-hop as well as the path from the selected alternate next-hop is
also necessary for SRLG protection.  S's shortest path to the selected
neighbor N may not be acceptable as an alternate next-hop to provide
SRLG protection, even if the path from N to D can provide SRLG
protection.

<t> In <xref target="ECMP_Figure"/> S has three primary next-hops to
reach D; these are L2 to E1, L2 to E2, and L3 to E3.  The primary
next-hop L2 to E1 can obtain link and node protection from L3 to E3,
which is one of the other primary next-hops; L2 to E1 cannot obtain
link protection from the other primary next-hop L2 to E2.  Similarly,
the primary next-hop L2 to E2 can only get node protection from L2 to
E1 and can only get link protection from L3 to E3.  The third primary
next-hop L3 to E3 can obtain link and node protection from L2 to E1
and from L2 to E2. It is possible for both the primary next-hop L2 to
E2 and the primary next-hop L2 to E1 to obtain an alternate next-hop
that provides both link and node protection by using L1.</t>

<t>Alternate next-hops are determined for each primary next-hop
separately.  As with alternate selection in the non-ECMP case, these
alternate next-hops should maximize the coverage of the failure
cases.</t>

<section anchor="RFC3137_Section"
	title="Interactions with IS-IS Overload, RFC 3137, and Costed Out Links">

<t>As described in <xref target="RFC3137"/>, there are cases where it
is desirable not to have a router used as a transit node.  For those
cases, it is also desirable not to have the router used on an
alternate path.</t>  

<t>For computing an alternate, a router MUST NOT use an alternate
next-hop that is along a link whose cost or reverse cost is LSInfinity
(for OSPF) or the maximum cost (for IS-IS) or that has the overload
bit set (for IS-IS).  For a broadcast link, the reverse cost associated
with a potential alternate next-hop is the cost towards the
pseudo-node advertised by the next-hop router. For point-to-point
links, if a specific link from the next-hop router cannot be
associated with a particular link, then the reverse cost considered is
that of the minimum cost link from the next-hop router back to S.</t>

<t>In the case of OSPF, if all links from router S to a neighbor N_i
have a reverse cost of LSInfinity, then router S MUST NOT use N_i as
an alternate.</t>

<t>Similarly in the case of IS-IS, if N_i has the overload bit set,
then S MUST NOT consider using N_i as an alternate.</t>

<t>This preserves the desired behavior of diverting traffic away from
a router that is following <xref target="RFC3137"/>, and it also
preserves the desired behavior when an operator sets the cost of a
link to LSInfinity for maintenance that is not permitting traffic
across that link unless there is no other path.</t>

<t>If a link or router that is costed out was the only possible
alternate to protect traffic from a particular router S to a
particular destination, then there should be no alternate provided for
protection.</t>

<section anchor="isis-link-attr_section"
  title="Interactions with IS-IS Link Attributes">

<t><xref target="RFC5029"/> describes several flags
whose interactions with LFAs need to be defined.  A router SHOULD NOT
specify the "local protection available" flag as a result of having
LFAs.  A router SHOULD NOT use an alternate next-hop that is along a
link for which the link has been advertised with the attribute "link
excluded from local protection path" or with the attribute "local
maintenance required".</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="Selection_Section" title="Selection Procedure">

<t>A router supporting this specification SHOULD attempt to select at
least one loop-free alternate next-hop for each primary next-hop used
for a given prefix.  A router MAY decide to not use an available
loop-free alternate next-hop.  A reason for such a decision might be
that the loop-free alternate next-hop does not provide protection for
the failure scenario of interest.</t>

<t>The alternate selection should maximize the coverage of the failure
cases.</t> 

<t>When calculating alternate next-hops, the calculating router S
applies the following rules.</t>

<t><list style="numbers">

<t>S SHOULD select a loop-free node-protecting alternate next-hop, if
one is available. If no loop-free node-protecting alternate is
available, then S MAY select a loop-free link-protecting alternate.</t>

<t>If S has a choice between a loop-free link-and-node-protecting
alternate and a loop-free node-protecting alternate that is not
link-protecting, S SHOULD select a loop-free link-and-node-protecting
alternate.  This can occur as explained in <xref
target="Broadcast"/>.</t>

<t>If S has multiple primary next-hops, then S SHOULD select as a
loop-free alternate either one of the other primary next-hops or a
loop-free node-protecting alternate if available.  If no loop-free
node-protecting alternate is available and no other primary next-hop
can provide link-protection, then S SHOULD select a loop-free
link-protecting alternate.</t>

<t> Implementations SHOULD support a mode where other primary
next-hops satisfying the basic loop-free condition and providing at
least link or node protection are preferred over any non-primary
alternates. This mode is provided to allow the administrator to
preserve traffic patterns based on regular ECMP behavior.</t>

<t>Implementations considering SRLGs MAY use SRLG protection to
determine that a node-protecting or link-protecting alternate is not
available for use.</t>

</list></t>

<t>Following the above rules maximizes the level of protection and use
of primary (ECMP) next-hops.</t>

<t>Each next-hop is associated with a set of non-mutually-exclusive
  characteristics based on whether it is used as a primary next-hop
  to a particular destination D, and the type of protection it can
  provide relative to a specific primary next-hop E:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Primary Path -"> The next-hop is used by S as primary.  
<vspace blankLines='0'/></t>

<t hangText="Loop-Free Node-Protecting Alternate -"> This next-hop

satisfies Inequality 1 but not Inequality 3.  If the primary next-hop uses a broadcast link, then this
next-hop satisfies Inequality 4.  <vspace

</list></t>

<t>An alternate path may also provide none, some, or complete SRLG
protection as well as node and link or link protection.  For instance,
a link may belong to two SRLGs G1 and G2.  The alternate path might
avoid other links in G1 but not G2, in which case the alternate would
only provide partial SRLG protection.</t>

<t>Below is an algorithm that can be used to calculate loop-free
alternate next-hops. The algorithm is given for informational purposes,
and implementations are free to use any other algorithm as long as it
satisfies the rules described above.</t>

<t>The following procedure describes how to select an alternate
next-hop.  The procedure is described to determine alternate
next-hops to use to reach each router in the topology.  Prefixes that
are advertised by a single router can use the alternate next-hop
computed for the router to which they are attached.  The same
procedure can be used to reach a prefix that is advertised by more
than one router when the logical topological transformation described
in <xref target="mhp_section"/> is used.</t>

<t>S is the computing router.  S has neighbors N_1 to N_j.  A
candidate next-hop is indicated by (outgoing link, neighbor) and
the outgoing link must be bidirectionally connected, as is
determined by the IGP.  The candidate next-hops of S are enumerated as
H_1 through H_k.  Recall that S may have multiple next-hops over
different interfaces to a neighbor.  H_i.link refers to the outgoing link of
that next-hop and H_i.neighbor refers to the neighbor of that next-hop.</t>

<t>For a particular destination router D, let S have already computed
D_opt(S, D), and for each neighbor N_i, D_opt(N_i, D), D_opt(N_i, S),
and D_opt(N_i, N_j), the distance from N_i to each other neighbor N_j,
and the set of SRLGs traversed by the path D_opt(N_i, D).  S should
follow the below procedure for every primary next-hop selected to
reach D. &nbsp;This set of primary next-hops is represented P_1 to P_p.
This procedure finds the alternate next-hop(s) for P_i.</t>

<t>First, initialize the alternate information for P_i as follows:</t>

           and H_h.link is bidirectional,</t>
        </list>
        then H_h can be considered as an alternate.  Otherwise, skip

          + D_opt(P_i.neighbor, D), set cand_node-protect to TRUE.</t>

     <t>If the router considers SRLGs, then set the cand_srlg-protect 
        to the set of SRLGs traversed on the path from S via P_i.link

</section>

<section title="LFA Types and Trade-Offs">

<t>LFAs can provide different amounts of protection, and the decision
about which type to prefer is dependent upon network topology and
other techniques in use in the network.  This section describes the
different protection levels and the trade-offs associated with each.</t>

<t><list style="numbers">

<t>Primary Next-hop: When there are equal-cost primary next-hops,
using one as an alternate is guaranteed not to cause micro-loops
involving S. &nbsp;Traffic flows across the paths that the network will
converge to, but congestion may be experienced on the primary paths
since traffic is sent across fewer.  All primary next-hops are
downstream paths.</t>

<t>Downstream Paths: A downstream path, unlike an LFA, is guaranteed
not to cause a micro-loop involving S regardless of the actual failure
detected.  However, the expected coverage of such alternates in a
network is expected to be poor.  All downstream paths are LFAs.</t>

<t>LFA: An LFA can have good coverage of a network, depending on
topology.  However, it is possible to get micro-loops involving S if
an unprotected failure occurs (e.g., a node fails when the LFA only
was link-protecting).</t>


</list></t>

<t>The different types of protection are abbreviated as LP
(link-protecting), NP (node-protecting), and SP (SRLG-protecting).</t>

<t><list style="letters"> 
<t>LP, NP, and SP: If such an alternate exists, it gives
protection against all failures.</t>

<t>LP and NP only: Many networks may handle SRLG failures via another
method or may focus on node and link failures as being more common.</t>

<t>LP only: A network may handle node failures via a high-availability
technique and be concerned primarily about protecting the more common
link failure case.</t>

<t>NP only: These only exist on interfaces that aren't point-to-point.  If
link protection is handled in a different layer, then an NP alternate
may be acceptable.</t>

</list></t>

</section>

<section title="A Simplification: Per-Next-Hop LFAs">

<t>It is possible to simplify the computation and use of LFAs when
solely link protection is desired by considering and computing only
one link-protecting LFA for each next-hop connected to the router.
All prefixes that use that next-hop as a primary will use the LFA
computed for that next-hop as its LFA.</t>

<t>Even a prefix with multiple primary next-hops will have each
primary next-hop protected individually by the primary next-hop's
associated LFA.  That associated LFA might or might not be another of
the primary next-hops of the prefix.</t>

<t>This simplification may reduce coverage in a network.  In addition
to limiting protection for multi-homed prefixes (see <xref 
target="mhp_section"/>), the computation per next-hop may also
not find an LFA when one could be found for some of the prefixes 
that use that next-hop.</t>

<t>For example, consider <xref target="ECMP_Figure"/> where S has three ECMP
next-hops, E1, E2, and E3 to reach D. &nbsp;For the prefix D, E3 can give
link protection for the next-hops E1 and E2; E1 and E2 can give link
protection for the next-hops E3.  However, if one uses this
simplification to compute LFAs for E1, E2, and E3 individually, there
is no link-protecting LFA for E1.  E3 and E2 can protect each other.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Using an Alternate">

<t>If an alternate next-hop is available, the router redirects traffic
to the alternate next-hop in case of a primary next-hop failure as
follows.</t>

<t>When a next-hop failure is detected via a local interface failure
or other failure detection mechanisms (see <xref
target="FRAMEWORK"/>), the router SHOULD:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
<t>Remove the primary next-hop associated with the failure.</t>
<t>Install the loop-free alternate calculated for the failed next-hop
if it is not already installed (e.g., the alternate is also a primary
next-hop).</t>
</list></t>

<t>Note that the router MAY remove other next-hops if it believes (via
SRLG analysis) that they may have been affected by the same failure,
even if it is not visible at the time of failure detection.</t>

<t>The alternate next-hop MUST be used only for traffic types that
are routed according to the shortest path.  Multicast traffic is
specifically out of scope for this specification.</t>

<section title="Terminating Use of Alternate">

<t>A router MUST limit the amount of time an alternate next-hop is
used after the primary next-hop has become unavailable.  This ensures
that the router will start using the new primary next-hops.  It
ensures that all possible transient conditions are removed and the
network converges according to the deployed routing protocol.</t>

<t>There are techniques available to handle the micro-forwarding loops
that can occur in a networking during convergence.</t>

<t>A router that implements <xref
target="MICROLOOP"/> SHOULD follow the rules
given there for terminating the use of an alternate. </t>

<t>A router that implements <xref
target="ORDERED-FIB"/> SHOULD follow the rules given
there for terminating the use of an alternate. </t>


<t>It is desirable to avoid micro-forwarding loops involving S. &nbsp;An
example illustrating the problem is given in <xref target=
"Figure_4"/>.  If the link from S to E fails, S will use N1 as an
alternate and S will compute N2 as the new primary next-hop to reach
D.  &nbsp;If S starts using N2 as soon as S can compute and install its new
primary, it is probable that N2 will not have yet installed its new
primary next-hop.  This would cause traffic to loop and be dropped
until N2 has installed the new topology.  This can be avoided by S
delaying its installation and leaving traffic on the alternate
next-hop.</t>

<t>This is an example of a case where the new primary is not a
loop-free alternate before the failure and therefore may have been
forwarding traffic through S. &nbsp;This will occur when the path via a
previously upstream node is shorter than the path via a loop-free
alternate neighbor.  In these cases, it is useful to give sufficient
time to ensure that the new primary neighbor and other nodes on the
new primary path have switched to the new route.</t>

<t>If the newly selected primary was loop-free before the failure,
then it is safe to switch to that new primary immediately; the new
primary wasn't dependent on the failure and therefore its path will
not have changed.</t>

<t>Given that there is an alternate providing appropriate protection
and while the assumption of a single failure holds, it is safe to
delay the installation of the new primaries; this will not create
forwarding loops because the alternate's path to the destination is
known to not go via S or the failed element and will therefore not be
affected by the failure.</t>

<t>An implementation SHOULD continue to use the alternate next-hops
for packet forwarding even after the new routing information is
available based on the new network topology.  The use of the alternate
next-hops for packet forwarding SHOULD terminate:</t>

<t><list style="letters">

<t>if the new primary next-hop was loop-free prior to the topology change, or</t>

<t>if a configured hold-down, which represents a worst-case bound on the length
of the network convergence transition, has expired, or </t>

<t>if notification of an unrelated topological change in the network is
received. </t>

<section title="Requirements on LDP Mode">

<t>Since LDP <xref target="RFC5036"/> traffic will follow the path
specified by the IGP, it is also possible for the LDP traffic to
follow the loop-free alternates indicated by the IGP.  To do so, it is
necessary for LDP to have the appropriate labels available for the
alternate so that the appropriate out-segments can be installed in the
forwarding plane before the failure occurs.</t>

<t>This means that a Label Switching Router (LSR) running LDP must
distribute its labels for the Forwarding Equivalence Classes (FECs) it can provide to all its
neighbors, regardless of whether or not they are upstream.
Additionally, LDP must be acting in liberal label retention mode so
that the labels that correspond to neighbors that aren't currently
the primary neighbor are stored.  Similarly, LDP should be in
downstream unsolicited mode, so that the labels for the FEC are
distributed other than along the SPT.</t>

<t>If these requirements are met, then LDP can use the loop-free
alternates without requiring any targeted sessions or signaling
extensions for this purpose.</t>

</section>
<section title="Routing Aspects">
<section anchor="mhp_section" title="Multi-Homed Prefixes">

<t>An SPF-like computation is run for each topology, which corresponds
to a particular OSPF area or IS-IS level.  The IGP needs to determine
loop-free alternates to multi-homed routes.  Multi-homed routes occur
for routes obtained from outside the routing domain by multiple
routers, for subnets on links where the subnet is announced from
multiple ends of the link, and for routes advertised by multiple
routers to provide resiliency.</t>

<t><xref target="Figure_5"/> demonstrates such a topology.  In this
example, the shortest path to reach the prefix p is via E.  &nbsp;The prefix
p will have the link to E as its primary next-hop.  If the alternate
next-hop for the prefix p is simply inherited from the router
advertising it on the shortest path to p, then the prefix p's
alternate next-hop would be the link to C.  &nbsp;This would provide link
protection, but not the node protection that is possible via A. </t>

<t>To determine the best protection possible, the prefix p can be
treated in the SPF computations as a node with unidirectional links
to it from those routers that have advertised the prefix.  Such a node
need never have its links explored, as it has no out-going links.</t>

<t>If there exist multiple multi-homed prefixes that share the
same connectivity and the difference in metrics to those routers, then
a single node can be used to represent the set.  For instance, if in
<xref target="Figure_5"/> there were another prefix X that was
connected to E with a metric of 1 and to F with a metric of 3, then
that prefix X could use the same alternate next-hop as was computed
for prefix p.</t>

<t>A router SHOULD compute the alternate next-hop for an IGP
multi-homed prefix by considering alternate paths via all routers that
have announced that prefix.</t>

<t>
In all cases, a router MAY safely simplify the multi-homed prefix (MHP) calculation
by assuming that the MHP is solely attached to the router
that was its pre-failure optimal point of attachment. However,
this may result in a prefix not being considered repairable,
when the full computation would show that a repair was
possible.

<t>OSPF introduces certain complications because it is possible for
the traffic path to exit an area and then re-enter that area.  This
can occur whenever a router considers the same route from multiple
areas.  There are several cases where issues such as this can occur.
They happen when another area permits a shorter path to connect two
ABRs than is available in the area where the LFA has been computed.
To clarify, an example topology is given in <xref 
target="OSPF_Example_Section"/>. </t>

<t><list style="letters">

<t>Virtual Links: These allow paths to leave the backbone area and
traverse the transit area.  The path provided via the transit area can
exit via any ABR.  The path taken is not the shortest path determined
by doing an SPF in the backbone area.</t>

<t>Alternate ABR <xref target="RFC3509"/>: When an ABR is not connected
to the backbone, it considers the inter-area summaries from multiple
areas.  The ABR A may determine to use area 2 but that path could
traverse another alternate ABR B that determines to use area 1.  This
can lead to scenarios similar to that illustrated in <xref
target="Trans-Area_Path_Figure"/>.</t>

<t>ASBR Summaries: An ASBR may itself be an ABR and can be announced
into multiple areas.  This presents other ABRs with a decision as to
which area to use.  This is the example illustrated in <xref
target="Trans-Area_Path_Figure"/>.</t>

<t>AS External Prefixes: A prefix may be advertised by multiple ASBRs
in different areas and/or with multiple forwarding addresses that are
in different areas, which are connected via at least one common ABR.
This presents such ABRs with a decision as to which area to use to
reach the prefix.</t>

</list></t>

<t>Loop-free alternates should not be used in an area where one of the
above issues affects that area.</t>

<section title="OSPF External Routing">

<t>When a forwarding address is set in an OSPF AS-external Link State Advertisement (LSA), all
routers in the network calculate their next-hops for the external
prefix by doing a lookup for the forwarding address in the routing
table, rather than using the next-hops calculated for the ASBR. In
this case, the alternate next-hops SHOULD be computed by selecting
among the alternate paths to the forwarding link(s) instead of among
alternate paths to the ASBR.</t>

<section title="BGP Next-Hop Synchronization">

<t>Typically, BGP prefixes are advertised with the AS exit router's
router-id as the BGP next-hop, and AS exit routers are reached by
means of IGP routes. BGP resolves its advertised next-hop to the
immediate next-hop by potential recursive lookups in the routing
database.  IP Fast Reroute computes the alternate next-hops to all IGP
destinations, which include alternate next-hops to the AS exit
router's router-id.  BGP simply inherits the alternate next-hop from
IGP.  The BGP decision process is unaltered; BGP continues to use the
IGP optimal distance to find the nearest exit router.  Multicast BGP (MBGP) routes do
not need to copy the alternate next-hops.</t>

<t>It is possible to provide ASBR protection if BGP selected a set of
 BGP next-hops and allowed the IGP to determine the primary and
 alternate next-hops as if the BGP route were a multi-homed prefix.
 This is for future study.</t>

</section>
<section title="Multicast Considerations">

<t>Multicast traffic is out of scope for this specification of IP
Fast Reroute.  The alternate next-hops SHOULD NOT be used for
multicast Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) checks.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>The mechanism described in this document does not modify any
routing protocol messages, and hence no new threats related to packet
modifications or replay attacks are introduced.  Traffic to certain
destinations can be temporarily routed via next-hop routers that would
not be used with the same topology change if this mechanism wasn't
employed. However, these next-hop routers can be used anyway when a
different topological change occurs, and hence this can't be viewed as
a new security threat.</t> 

<t>In LDP, the wider distribution of FEC label information is still to
neighbors with whom a trusted LDP session has been established.  This
wider distribution and the recommendation of using liberal label
retention mode are believed to have no significant security impact.</t>

<abstract><t>This document provides a framework for the development of IP fast- reroute mechanisms which provide protection against link or router failure by invoking locally determined repair paths.  Unlike MPLS Fast-reroute, the mechanisms are applicable to a network employing conventional IP routing and forwarding.  An essential part of such mechanisms is the prevention of packet loss caused by the loops which normally occur during the re-convergence of the network following a failure.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>Link-state routing protocols (e.g. OSPF or IS-IS) are known to converge to a loop-free state within a finite period of time after a change in the topology. It is normal, however, to observe short-term loops during the period of topology update propagation, route recalculation, and forwarding table update, due to the asynchronous nature of link-state protocol operation. This document provides an analysis of formation of such microloops and suggests simple mechanisms to minimize them.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>This draft describes a mechanism for use in conjunction with link state routing protocols which prevents the transient loops which would otherwise occur during topology changes.  It does this by correctly sequencing the FIB updates on the routers.  This mechanism can be used in the case of non-urgent link or node shutdowns and restarts or link metric changes.  It can also be used in conjunction with a FRR mechanism which converts a sudden link or node failure into a non-urgent topology change.  This is possible where a complete repair path is provided for all affected destinations.  After a non-urgent topology change, each router computes a rank that defines the time at which it can safely update its FIB.  A method for accelerating this loop-free convergence process by the use of completion messages is also described.</t></abstract>

<t>In <xref target="Trans-Area_Path_Figure"/>, the ASBR is also an ABR
and is announced into both area 1 and area 2.  A and B are both ABRs
that are also connected to the backbone area.  S determines that N can
provide a loop-free alternate to reach the ASBR.  N's path goes via A.
&nbsp;A also sees an intra-area route to ASBR via area 2; the cost of the
path in area 2 is 30, which is less than 35, the cost of the path in
area 1.  Therefore, A uses the path from area 2 and directs traffic to
F.  &nbsp;The path from F in area 2 goes to B.  &nbsp;B is also an ABR and learns
the ASBR from both areas 1 and area 2; B's path via area 1 is shorter
(cost 20) than B's path via area 2 (cost 25).  Therefore, B uses the
path from area 1 that connects to S.</t>
