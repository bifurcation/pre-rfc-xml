    <abstract>
      <t>
        The registration policy for the "Network Configuration Protocol
	(NETCONF) Capability URNs" registry, set up by RFC 6241, has turned out
	to be unnecessarily strict.  This document changes that registration
	policy to "IETF Review", allowing registrations from certain
	well-reviewed Experimental RFCs, in addition to Standards Track RFCs.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The "Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) Capability URNs"
        registry <xref target="RFC6241"/> was set up with a registration policy
        of "Standards Action" <xref target="RFC5226"/>, allowing registrations only
        from Standards Track RFCs.  This provided thorough review of the specifications
        that are requesting NETCONF Capability URNs.  It has turned out to be desirable
        to allocate capability URNs for certain Experimental RFCs also, provided those
        specifications are also carefully reviewed.  The existing registration policy
        is, therefore, unnecessarily strict, requiring exception handling by
	the IESG. This document changes that registration policy to "IETF
	Review", which also 
        allows registrations from certain well-reviewed Experimental RFCs,
        or, for example, corrections to registry errors from Informational RFCs,
        with IETF review and consensus.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
        IANA has changed the registration policy for the "Network
	Configuration Protocol 
        (NETCONF) Capability URNs" registry to "IETF Review" and has added this
	document to the 
        registry's reference field.
      </t>
      <t>
        Registrations made from RFCs that are not on the Standards Track need
	to be carefully reviewed through IETF Last Call and in consultation with
	relevant working groups, such as NETCONF. The Operations and
   Management Area Directors should confirm that the document has received the
   appropriate level of review during IESG Evaluation.
      </t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        This document is purely procedural, and there are no related security
	considerations.
