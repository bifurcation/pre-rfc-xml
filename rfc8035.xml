        This document updates RFC 5761 by clarifying the SDP offer/answer negotiation of
        RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) multiplexing. It makes it clear that an answerer can only include
        an "a=rtcp-mux" attribute in a Session Description Protocol (SDP) answer if the associated SDP offer contained
        the attribute.

<t>OLD TEXT:</t>

<t>
 When the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [8] is used to negotiate
 RTP sessions following the offer/answer model [9], the "a=rtcp-mux"
 attribute (see Section 8) indicates the desire to multiplex RTP and
 RTCP onto a single port.  The initial SDP offer MUST include this
 attribute at the media level to request multiplexing of RTP and RTCP
 on a single port.  For example:

<figure><artwork>
    v=0
    o=csp 1153134164 1153134164 IN IP6 2001:DB8::211:24ff:fea3:7a2e
    s=-
    c=IN IP6 2001:DB8::211:24ff:fea3:7a2e
    t=1153134164 1153137764
    m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 97
    a=rtpmap:97 iLBC/8000
    a=rtcp-mux
</artwork></figure></t>

<t>
 This offer denotes a unicast voice-over-IP session using the RTP/AVP
 profile with iLBC coding.  The answerer
 is requested to send both RTP and RTCP to port 49170 on IPv6 address
 2001:DB8::211:24ff:fea3:7a2e.
</t>

<t>
 If the answerer wishes to multiplex RTP and RTCP onto a single port,
 it MUST include a media-level "a=rtcp-mux" attribute in the answer.
 The RTP payload types used in the answer MUST conform to the rules in
 Section 4.
</t>

<t>
 If the answer does not contain an "a=rtcp-mux" attribute, the offerer
 MUST NOT multiplex RTP and RTCP packets on a single port.  Instead,
 it should send and receive RTCP on a port allocated according to the
 usual port-selection rules (either the port pair, or a signalled port
 if the "a=rtcp:" attribute [10] is also included).  This will occur
 when talking to a peer that does not understand the "a=rtcp-mux"
 attribute.
</t>
<t>
 When SDP is used in a declarative manner, the presence of an "a=rtcp-mux" attribute signals that the sender will multiplex RTP and RTCP on
 the same port.  The receiver MUST be prepared to receive RTCP packets
 on the RTP port, and any resource reservation needs to be made
 including the RTCP bandwidth.
</t>

 When the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [8] is used to negotiate
 RTP sessions following the offer/answer model [9], the "a=rtcp-mux"
 attribute (see Section 8) indicates the desire to multiplex RTP and
 RTCP onto a single port, and the usage is always negotiated for both
 directions.
</t>
<t>
 If the offerer wishes to multiplex RTP and RTCP onto a single port,
 the initial SDP offer MUST include the attribute at the media level to
 request multiplexing of RTP and RTCP on a single port. For example:
<figure><artwork>
     v=0
     o=csp 1153134164 1153134164 IN IP6 2001:DB8::211:24ff:fea3:7a2e

     a=rtpmap:97 iLBC/8000
     a=rtcp-mux
</artwork></figure></t>
<t>
 This offer denotes a unicast voice-over-IP session using the RTP/AVP
 profile with Internet Low Bit Rate Codec (iLBC) coding.  The answerer
 is requested to send both RTP and RTCP to port 49170 on IPv6 address
 2001:DB8::211:24ff:fea3:7a2e.
</t>
<t>
 If the offer contains the "a=rtcp-mux" attribute, and if the answerer
 wishes to multiplex RTP and RTCP onto a single port, it MUST include a
 media-level "a=rtcp-mux" attribute in the answer. The RTP payload
 types used in the answer MUST conform to the rules in Section 4. If
 the offer does not contain the "a=rtcp-mux" attribute, the answerer
 MUST NOT include an "a=rtcp-mux" attribute in the answer, and the
 answerer MUST NOT multiplex RTP and RTCP packets on a single port.
</t>
<t>
 If the answer contains an "a=rtcp-mux" attribute, the offerer and
 answerer MUST multiplex RTP and RTCP packets on a single port.
