    <abstract>
      <t>RFC 2754 requested that each time IANA made an address assignment, it
      was to create appropriate inetnum and as-block objects and digitally
      sign them. The purpose was to distribute the IANA-held public key in
      software implementations of the Distributed Routing Policy System. In
      practice, this was never done on the public Internet. This document
      requests that RFC 2754 be moved to Historic status.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) (www.iana.org) is
      charged with allocating parameter values for fields in protocols that
      have been designed, created, or are maintained by the Internet
      Engineering Task Force (IETF). RFC 2754 <xref target="RFC2754"></xref>
      requests that the IANA create a repository of Routing Policy Specification
      Language (RPSL) objects and digitally sign them. The RFC identifies the
      initial objects to be signed and also requests that each time IANA makes
      an address assignment it also create new objects as needed and sign them
      as well. In practice, this was never done in the public Internet. During
      a detailed review of IANA's protocol registration activities in support
      of the IETF, this request for IANA action was identified as one of those
      that had not been completed after publication of the RFC.</t>

      <t>This document obsoletes RFC 2754 <xref target="RFC2754"></xref>,
      recommends that it be moved to Historic status, and directs IANA not to
      move forward with the IANA actions in that RFC.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Details">
      <t>RFC 2754 <xref target="RFC2754"></xref> requests that the IANA create
      a repository of RPSL objects and digitally sign them. The RFC identifies
      the initial objects to be signed and also requests that each time IANA
      makes an address assignment it also create new objects as needed and
      sign them as well.</t>

      <t>During a review of RFCs in 2009, it became apparent that the IANA
      actions requested in RFC 2754 were never done. In the intervening time,
      another technology appears to be taking the role once envisioned for
      Distributed RPSL. Both an architecture 
      and infrastructure now exist for secure routing using Resource Public 
      Key Infrastructure (RPKI) technologies. As an example, the semantics of 
      a Route Origin Authorization (ROA) -- an application of the RPKI --
      to validate the origination of routes has been standardized by the
      IETF.</t>
      
      <t>Implementation of the IANA actions in RFC 2754 would
      now require significant implementation complexity. In the face of
      alternative technology, and given that the requested actions have not
      been implemented in the public Internet, it is proposed to reclassify
      RFC&nbsp;2754 <xref target="RFC2754"></xref> as Historic and to
      direct the
      IANA not to pursue or implement the IANA requests in that document.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The word "allocation" designates a block of addresses managed by a
      registry for the purpose of making assignments and allocations. The word
      "assignment" designates a block of addresses, or a single address,
      registered to an end-user for use on a specific network, or set of
      networks.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is instructed not to pursue or implement the IANA actions
      requested in RFC 2754 <xref target="RFC2754"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The intended signature of inetnum and as-block objects never took
      place in the public Internet. Moving RFC 2754 <xref
      target="RFC2754"></xref> to Historic status would have no known impact
      on the security of the Internet.</t>
