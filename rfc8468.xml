    <abstract>
      <t>This memo updates the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) framework defined
      by RFC 2330 with new considerations for measurement methodology and
      testing. It updates the definition of standard-formed packets to include
      IPv6 packets, deprecates the definition of minimal IP packet, and
      augments distinguishing aspects, referred to as Type-P, for test packets
      in RFC 2330. This memo identifies that IPv4-IPv6 coexistence can
      challenge measurements within the scope of the IPPM framework. Example
      use cases include, but are not limited to, IPv4-IPv6 translation, NAT,
      and protocol encapsulation. IPv6 header compression and use of IPv6 over
      Low-Power Wireless Area Networks (6LoWPAN) are considered and excluded
      from the standard-formed packet evaluation.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group first created a
      framework for metric development in <xref target="RFC2330"/>. This
      framework has stood the test of time and enabled development of many
      fundamental metrics. It has been updated in the area of metric
      composition <xref target="RFC5835"/> and in several areas related to
      active stream measurement of modern networks with reactive properties
      <xref target="RFC7312"/>.</t>

      <t>The IPPM framework <xref target="RFC2330"/> recognized (in Section
      13) that many aspects of an IP packet can influence its processing
      during transfer across the network.</t>

      <t>In Section 15 of <xref target="RFC2330"/>, the notion of a
      "standard-formed" packet is defined. However, the definition was never
      expanded to include IPv6, even though the authors of <xref
      target="RFC2330"/> explicitly identified the need for this update in
      Section 15: "the version field is 4 (later, we will expand this to
      include 6)".</t>


      <t>In particular, IPv6 Extension Headers and protocols that use IPv6
      header compression are growing in use. This memo seeks to provide the
      needed updates to the original definition in <xref
      target="RFC2330"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements Language">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      BCP&nbsp;14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Scope">
      <t>The purpose of this memo is to expand the coverage of IPPM to include
      IPv6, highlight additional aspects of test packets, and make them part
      of the IPPM framework.</t>

      <t>The scope is to update key sections of <xref target="RFC2330"/>,
      adding considerations that will aid the development of new measurement
      methodologies intended for today's IP networks. Specifically, this memo
      expands the Type-P examples in Section 13 of <xref target="RFC2330"/> and expands the definition (in
      Section 15 of <xref target="RFC2330"/>) of a standard-formed packet to include IPv6 header aspects
      and other features.</t>

      <t>Other topics in <xref target="RFC2330"/> that might be updated or
      augmented are deferred to future work. This includes the topics of
      passive and various forms of hybrid active/passive measurements.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Packets of Type-P">
      <t>A fundamental property of many Internet metrics is that the measured
      value of the metric depends on characteristics of the IP packet(s) used
      to make the measurement. Potential influencing factors include IP header
      fields and their values, as well as higher-layer protocol headers and
      their values. Consider an IP-connectivity metric: one obtains different
      results depending on whether one is interested in, for example,
      connectivity for packets destined for well-known TCP ports or unreserved
      UDP ports, those with invalid IPv4 checksums, or those with TTL or Hop
      Limit of 16. In some circumstances, these distinctions will result in
      special treatment of packets in intermediate nodes and end systems --
      for example, if Diffserv <xref target="RFC2474"/>, Explicit Congestion
      Notification (ECN) <xref target="RFC3168"/>, Router Alert <xref
      target="RFC6398"/>, Hop-by-Hop extensions <xref target="RFC7045"/>, or
      Flow Labels <xref target="RFC6437"/> are used, or in the presence of
      firewalls or RSVP reservations.</t>

      <t>Because of this distinction, we introduce the generic notion of a
      "packet of Type-P", where in some contexts P will be explicitly defined
      (i.e., exactly what type of packet we mean), partially defined (e.g.,
      "with a payload of B octets"), or left generic. Thus, we may talk about
      generic IP-Type-P-connectivity or more specific
      IP-port-HTTP-connectivity. Some metrics and methodologies may be
      fruitfully defined using generic Type-P definitions, which are then made
      specific when performing actual measurements.</t>

      <t>Whenever a metric's value depends on the type of the packets
      involved, the metric's name will include either a specific type or a
      phrase such as "Type-P". Thus, we will not define an "IP-connectivity"
      metric but instead an "IP-Type-P-connectivity" metric and/or perhaps an
      "IP-port-HTTP-connectivity" metric. This naming convention serves as an
      important reminder that one must be conscious of the exact type of
      traffic being measured.</t>

      <t>If the information constituting Type-P at the Source is found to have
      changed at the Destination (or at a measurement point between the Source
      and Destination, as in <xref target="RFC5644"/>), then the modified
      values MUST be noted and reported with the results. Some modifications
      occur according to the conditions encountered in transit (such as
      congestion notification) or due to the requirements of segments of the
      Source-to-Destination path. For example, the packet length will change
      if IP headers are converted to the alternate version/address family or optional Extension Headers are added or removed. Even header fields like
      TTL/Hop Limit that typically change in transit may be relevant to
      specific tests. For example, Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) <xref
      target="RFC4861"/> packets are transmitted with the Hop Limit value set
      to 255, and the validity test specifies that the Hop Limit MUST have a
      value of 255 at the receiver, too. So, while other tests may
      intentionally exclude the TTL/Hop Limit value from their Type-P
      definition, for this particular test, the correct Hop Limit value is of
      high relevance and MUST be part of the Type-P definition.</t>

      <t>Local policies in intermediate nodes based on examination of IPv6
      Extension Headers may affect measurement repeatability. If intermediate
      nodes follow the recommendations of <xref target="RFC7045"/>,
      repeatability may be improved to some degree.</t>

      <t>A closely related note: It would be very useful to know if a given
      Internet component (like a host, link, or path) treats equally a class C
      of different types of packets. If so, then any one of those types of
      packets can be used for subsequent measurement of the component. This
      suggests we should devise a metric or suite of metrics that attempt to
      determine class C (a designation that has no relationship to address
      assignments, of course).</t>

      <t>Load-balancing over parallel paths is one particular example where
      such a class C would be more complex to determine in IPPM measurements.
      Load balancers and routers often use flow identifiers, computed as
      hashes (of specific parts) of the packet header, for deciding among the
      available parallel paths a packet will traverse. Packets with identical
      hashes are assigned to the same flow and forwarded to the same resource
      in the load balancer's (or router's) pool. The presence of a load
      balancer on the measurement path, as well as the specific headers and
      fields that are used for the forwarding decision, are not known when
      measuring the path as a black box. Potential assessment scenarios
      include the measurement of one of the parallel paths, and the
      measurement of all available parallel paths that the load balancer can
      use. Therefore, knowledge of a load balancer's flow definition
      (alternatively, its class-C-specific treatment in terms of header fields
      in scope of hash operations) is a prerequisite for repeatable
      measurements. A path may have more than one stage of load-balancing,
      adding to class C definition complexity.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Standard-Formed Packets">
      <t>Unless otherwise stated, all metric definitions that concern IP
      packets include an implicit assumption that the packet is
      standard-formed. A packet is standard-formed if it meets all of the
      following REQUIRED criteria:</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="+">It includes a valid IP header. See below for
          version-specific criteria.</t>

          <t hangText="+">It is not an IP fragment.</t>

          <t hangText="+">The Source and Destination addresses correspond to
          the intended Source and Destination, including Multicast Destination
          addresses.</t>

          <t hangText="+">If a transport header is present, it contains a
          valid checksum and other valid fields.</t>
        </list>For an IPv4 packet (as specified in <xref target="RFC0791"/> and the RFCs that update it) to be
      standard-formed, the following additional criteria are REQUIRED:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>The version field is 4.</t>

         



          <t>The Internet Header Length (IHL) value is &gt;= 5; the checksum
          is correct.</t>

          <t>Its total length as given in the IPv4 header corresponds to the
          size of the IPv4 header plus the size of the payload.</t>

          <t>Either the packet possesses sufficient TTL to travel from the
          Source to the Destination if the TTL is decremented by one at each
          hop or it possesses the maximum TTL of 255.</t>

          <t>It does not contain IP options unless explicitly noted.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>For an IPv6 packet (as specified in <xref target="RFC8200"/> and any future updates) to
      be standard-formed, the following criteria are REQUIRED:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>The version field is 6.</t>

          <t>Its total length corresponds to the size of the IPv6 header (40
          octets) plus the length of the payload as given in the IPv6
          header.</t>

          <t>The payload length value for this packet (including Extension
          Headers) conforms to the IPv6 specifications.</t>

          <t>Either the packet possesses sufficient Hop Limit to travel from
          the Source to the Destination if the Hop Limit is decremented by one
          at each hop or it possesses the maximum Hop Limit of 255.</t>

          <t>Either the packet does not contain IP Extension Headers or it
          contains the correct number and type of headers as specified in the
          packet and the headers appear in the standard-conforming order (Next
          Header).</t>

          <t>All parameters used in the header and Extension Headers are found
          in the "Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Parameters" registry
          specified in <xref target="IANA-6P"/>.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Two mechanisms require some discussion in the context of
      standard-formed packets, namely IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Area
      Networks (6LowPAN) <xref target="RFC4944"/> and Robust Header
      Compression (ROHC) <xref target="RFC3095"/>. 6LowPAN, as defined in
      <xref target="RFC4944"/> and updated by <xref target="RFC6282"/> with
      header compression and <xref target="RFC6775"/> with neighbor discovery
      optimizations, proposes solutions for using IPv6 in resource-constrained
      environments. An adaptation layer enables the transfer of IPv6 packets
      over networks having an MTU smaller than the minimum IPv6 MTU.
      Fragmentation and reassembly of IPv6 packets, as well as the resulting
      state that would be stored in intermediate nodes, poses substantial
      challenges to measurements. Likewise, ROHC operates statefully in
      compressing headers on subpaths, storing state in intermediate hosts.
      The modification of measurement packets' Type-P by ROHC and 6LowPAN
      requires substantial work, as do requirements with respect to the
      concept of standard-formed packets for these two protocols. For these
      reasons, we consider ROHC and 6LowPAN packets to be out of the scope of
      the standard-formed packet evaluation.</t>

      <t>The topic of IPv6 Extension Headers brings current controversies into
      focus, as noted by <xref target="RFC6564"/> and <xref
      target="RFC7045"/>. However, measurement use cases in the context of the
      IPPM framework, such as in situ OAM <xref target="IOAM-DATA"/> in
      enterprise environments, can benefit from inspection, modification,
      addition, or deletion of IPv6 extension headers in hosts along the
      measurement path.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC8250"/> endorses the use of the IPv6 Destination
      Option for measurement purposes, consistent with other relevant and
      approved IETF specifications.</t>

      <t>The following additional considerations apply when IPv6 Extension
      Headers are present:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Extension Header inspection: Some intermediate nodes may inspect
          Extension Headers or the entire IPv6 packet while in transit. In
          exceptional cases, they may drop the packet or route via a
          suboptimal path, and measurements may be unreliable or unrepeatable.
          The packet (if it arrives) may be standard-formed, with a
          corresponding Type-P.</t>

          <t>Extension Header modification: In Hop-by-Hop headers, some
          TLV-encoded options may be permitted to change at intermediate nodes
          while in transit. The resulting packet may be standard-formed, with
          a corresponding Type-P.</t>

          <t>Extension Header insertion or deletion: Although such behavior is
          not endorsed by current standards, it is possible that Extension
          Headers could be added to, or removed from, the header chain. The
          resulting packet may be standard-formed, with a corresponding
          Type-P. This point simply encourages measurement system designers to
          be prepared for the unexpected and notify users when such events
          occur. There are issues with Extension Header insertion and
          deletion, of course, such as exceeding the path MTU due to
          insertion, etc.</t>

          <t>A change in packet length (from the corresponding packet observed
          at the Source) or header modification is a significant factor in
          Internet measurement and REQUIRES a new Type-P to be reported with
          the test results.</t>
        </list>It is further REQUIRED that if a packet is described as having
      a "length of B octets", then 0 &lt;= B &lt;= 65535; and if B is the
      payload length in octets, then B &lt;= (65535-IP header size in octets,
      including any Extension Headers). The jumbograms defined in <xref
      target="RFC2675"/> are not covered by the above length analysis, but if
      the IPv6 Jumbogram Payload Hop-by-Hop Option Header is present, then a
      packet with corresponding length MUST be considered standard-formed. In
      practice, the path MTU will restrict the length of standard-formed
      packets that can successfully traverse the path. Path MTU Discovery for
      IP version 6 (PMTUD, <xref target="RFC8201"/>) or Packetization Layer
      Path MTU Discovery (PLPMTUD, <xref target="RFC4821"/>) is recommended to
      prevent fragmentation.</t>

      <t>So, for example, one might imagine defining an IP-connectivity metric
      as "IP-Type-P-connectivity for standard-formed packets with the IP
      Diffserv field set to 0", or, more succinctly, "IP-Type-P-connectivity
      with the IP Diffserv field set to 0", since standard-formed is already
      implied by convention. Changing the contents of a field, such as the
      Diffserv Code Point, ECN bits, or Flow Label may have a profound effect
      on packet handling during transit, but does not affect a packet's status
      as standard-formed. Likewise, the addition, modification, or deletion of
      extension headers may change the handling of packets in transit
      hosts.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC2330"/> defines the "minimal IP packet from A to B"
      as a particular type of standard-formed packet often useful to consider.
      When defining IP metrics, no packet smaller or simpler than this can be
      transmitted over a correctly operating IP network. However, the concept
      of the minimal IP packet has not been employed (since typical active
      measurement systems employ a transport layer and a payload), and its
      practical use is limited. Therefore, this memo deprecates the concept of
      the "minimal IP packet from A to B".</t>
    </section>

    <section title="NAT, IPv4-IPv6 Transition, and Compression Techniques">
      <t>This memo adds the key considerations for utilizing IPv6 in two
      critical conventions of the IPPM framework, namely packets of Type-P and
      standard-formed packets. The need for coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6 has
      originated transitioning standards like the framework for IPv4/IPv6
      translation in <xref target="RFC6144"/> or the IP/ICMP translation
      algorithms in <xref target="RFC7915"/> and <xref target="RFC7757"/>.</t>

      <t>The definition and execution of measurements within the context of
      the IPPM framework is challenged whenever such translation mechanisms
      are present along the measurement path. In use cases like IPv4-IPv6
      translation, NAT, protocol encapsulation, or IPv6 header compression may
      result in modification of the measurement packet's Type-P along the
      path. All these changes MUST be reported. Example consequences include,
      but are not limited to:</t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Modification or addition of headers or header field values in
          intermediate nodes. IPv4-IPv6 transitioning or IPv6 header
          compression mechanisms may result in changes of the measurement
          packets' Type-P, too. Consequently, hosts along the measurement path
          may treat packets differently because of the Type-P modification.
          Measurements at observation points along the path may also need
          extra context to uniquely identify a packet.</t>

          <t>Network Address Translators (NAT) on the path can have an
          unpredictable impact on latency measurement (in terms of the amount
          of additional time added) and possibly other types of measurements.
          It is not usually possible to control this impact as testers may not
          have any control of the underlying network or middleboxes. There is
          a possibility that stateful NAT will lead to unstable performance
          for a flow with specific Type-P, since state needs to be created for
          the first packet of a flow and state may be lost later if the NAT
          runs out of resources. However, this scenario does not invalidate
          the Type-P for testing; for example, the purpose of a test might be
          exactly to quantify the NAT's impact on delay variation. The
          presence of NAT may mean that the measured performance of Type-P
          will change between the source and the destination. This can cause
          an issue when attempting to correlate measurements conducted on
          segments of the path that include or exclude the NAT. Thus, it is a
          factor to be aware of when conducting measurements.</t>

          <t>Variable delay due to internal state. One side effect of changes
          due to IPv4-IPv6 transitioning mechanisms is the variable delay that
          intermediate nodes experience for header modifications. Similar to
          NAT, the allocation of internal state and establishment of context
          within intermediate nodes may cause variable delays, depending on
          the measurement stream pattern and position of a packet within the
          stream. For example, the first packet in a stream will typically
          trigger allocation of internal state in an intermediate IPv4-IPv6
          transition host. Subsequent packets can benefit from lower
          processing delay due to the existing internal state. However, large
          interpacket delays in the measurement stream may result in the
          intermediate host deleting the associated state and needing to
          re-establish it on arrival of another stream packet. It is worth
          noting that this variable delay due to internal state allocation in
          intermediate nodes can be an explicit use case for measurements.</t>

          <t>Variable delay due to packet length. IPv4-IPv6 transitioning or
          header compression mechanisms modify the length of measurement
          packets. The modification of the packet size may or may not change
          how the measurement path treats the packets.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
      live paths are relevant here as well. See <xref target="RFC4656"/> and
      <xref target="RFC5357"/>.</t>

      <t>When considering the privacy of those involved in measurement or
      those whose traffic is measured, the sensitive information available to
      potential observers is greatly reduced when using active techniques that
      are within this scope of work. Passive observations of user traffic for
      measurement purposes raise many privacy issues. We refer the reader to
      the privacy considerations described in the Large Scale Measurement of
      Broadband Performance (LMAP) framework <xref target="RFC7594"/>, which
      covers active and passive techniques.</t>

      <t>The authors thank Brian Carpenter for identifying the lack of IPv6
      coverage in IPPM's framework and listing additional distinguishing
      factors for packets of Type-P. Both Brian and Fred Baker discussed many
      of the interesting aspects of IPv6 with the coauthors, leading to a more
      solid first draft: thank you both. Thanks to Bill Jouris for an
      editorial pass through the pre-00 text. As we completed our journey,
      Nevil Brownlee, Mike Heard, Spencer Dawkins, Warren Kumari, and Suresh
      Krishnan all contributed useful suggestions.</t>
