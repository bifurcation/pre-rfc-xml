    <abstract>
      <t>This is an informational document that provides guidelines
      for using the privacy mechanism for the Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP), which is specified in RFC 3323 and subsequently
      extended in RFCs 3325 and 4244. It is intended to clarify the
      handling of the target SIP headers/parameters and the Session
      Description Protocol (SDP) parameters for each of the privacy header values (priv-values).</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>This document clarifies the privacy mechanism for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> defined in <xref target="RFC3323"></xref>, which was later extended in <xref target="RFC3325"></xref> and <xref target="RFC4244"></xref>.  This document describes the practical manner of operations of the privacy mechanism as a guideline and does not change the existing privacy mechanism.</t>

      <t>In RFC 3323, the semantics of the basic set of priv-values
      (header, session, user, none, and critical) is defined, but
      there are some ambiguities in regards to the target information
      to be obscured per priv-value, which are not explicitly
      specified.  An ambiguity such as this could result in different
      interpretations of privacy handling for each of the priv-values
      defined, both at an entity setting a Privacy header and at an
      entity processing a Privacy header, which could have an adverse impact on interoperability.</t>

      <t>Additional priv-values "id" and "history" are defined in RFCs 3325 and 4244, respectively.</t>

      <t>In RFC 4244, the priv-value "history" is defined in order to request privacy for History-Info headers, and the target to be obscured for "history" priv-value is specified as only the History-Info headers.  In addition, the RFC clearly describes that History-Info headers are also the target when "header"- and "session"-level privacy are requested.</t>

      <t>On the other hand, RFC 3325 defines the P-Asserted-Identity header and a priv-value "id", which is used to request privacy for only the P-Asserted-Identity header, but it does not specify how other priv-values may impact the privacy handling of the P-Asserted-Identity header. Because of this lack of specification, it has been observed that some implementations are suffering from the inability to achieve the intended privacy due to discrepancies in interpretations.</t>

      <t>This document tries to clarify the SIP headers and SDP parameters to be obscured for each of the priv-values to alleviate the potential interoperability issues already seen due to a lack of explicit text.</t>

      <t>Tables in this section show the recommended treatment of SIP
      headers and SDP parameters per priv-value.  SIP headers and SDP
      parameters not shown in the tables are regarded as non-targets

      <t>The way in which SIP headers and SDP parameters listed here are obscured may depend on the implementation and network policy. This document does not prevent different variations that may exist based on local policy but tries to provide recommendations for how a privacy service treats SIP headers and SDP parameters.

        <t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging"><t hangText="Note:">
Any time a privacy service modifies a Call-ID, it MUST retain the
former and modified values as indicated in Section 5.3 in RFC 3323.
It MUST then restore the former value in a Call-ID header and other
corresponding headers and parameters (such as In-Reply-To, Replaces, and Target-Dialog) in any messages that are sent using the modified Call-ID to the originating user agent.  It should also modify a Call-ID header and other corresponding headers/parameters (such as Target-Dialog and "replaces" parameter) in any further relevant messages that are sent by the originating user agent.  Refer to Section 5.1.1 (Call-ID) for the detailed behavior.</t></list></t>

        <t>Identity/Identity-Info, Path, Replaces, Route, Service-Route, and Target-Dialog headers are not targets of these priv-values (and should not be anonymized or modified by a user agent and a privacy service based on a priv-value in a Privacy header).  Refer to Section 5.3 for details.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Target SDP Parameters for Each priv-value">
        <t>The recommended PS behaviors for each SDP parameters are
        simple.  The c, m, o, i, u, e, and p lines in SIP request/response are recommended to be anonymized when user privacy is requested with Privacy:session.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Treatment of priv-value Not Supported by the Privacy Service">

        <t>As specified in RFC 3323, if the priv-value of "critical" is present in the Privacy header of a request, and if the privacy service is incapable of performing all of the levels of privacy specified in the Privacy header, it MUST fail the request with a 500 (Server Error) response code as indicated in Section 5 in RFC 3323.</t>

        <t>Since the protection of privacy is important, even if the priv-value "critical" is not present in the Privacy header, the privacy service should fail the request with a 500 response code when it is incapable of performing all of the levels of privacy specified in the Privacy header.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Recommended Treatment of User-Privacy-Sensitive Information">

      <t>The following SIP headers and related parameters may concern privacy.  This section describes what kind of user-privacy-sensitive information may be included in each SIP header/parameter, and how to maintain privacy for such information at a user agent or a privacy service when the information is indeed privacy-sensitive.</t>

      <section anchor="target_header" title="Target SIP Headers">

        <t>This section describes privacy considerations and recommended treatment for each SIP header that may reveal user-privacy-sensitive information.  This section goes into details about how each header affects privacy, the desired treatment of the value by the user agent and privacy service, and other instructions/additional notes necessary to provide privacy.</t>

        <section title="Call-ID">

          <t>This field frequently contains an IP address or hostname of a UAC (User Agent Client) appended to the Call-ID value.</t>

          <t>A user agent executing a user-level privacy function on its own SHOULD substitute for the IP address or hostname that is frequently appended to the Call-ID value a suitably long random value (the value used as the 'tag' for the From header of the request might even be reused) as indicated in Section 4.1 in RFC 3323.</t>

          <t>A privacy service MAY anonymize the Call-ID header field when the request contains Privacy:user by substituting for the IP address or hostname in the Call-ID a suitably long random value (such as a From tag value) so that it is sufficiently unique as indicated in Section 5.3 in RFC 3323.</t>

          <t>Call-ID is essential to dialog matching, so any time a privacy service modifies this field, it MUST retain the former value and restore it in a Call-ID header field in any messages that are sent to/by the originating user agent inside the dialog as indicated in Section 5.3 in RFC 3323.  A privacy service should be prepared to receive a request outside the dialog containing the value of the Call-ID set by the PS in other SIP headers (e.g., In-Reply-To/Replaces/Target-Dialog), at least while the dialog state is active for the dialog whose Call-ID was modified by that PS.  When such a request is received, the Call-ID value contained in the relevant headers indicated above should be replaced by the retained value.

          <list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Note:">This is possible only if the privacy
            service maintains the state and retains all the
            information it modified to provide privacy.  Some PSs are
            known to encrypt information prior to obfuscation in the
            Via header field etc.  In this case, the PS cannot
            correlate the modified Call-ID value with the original
            Call-ID.  Further challenges are imposed when the PS needs
            to stay on a signaling path to ensure that it receives all
            the messages targeted towards the caller for which a PS provides privacy, especially when the request is out-of-dialog.</t></list></t>

          <t>Refer to the corresponding sections, 5.1.6 (In-Reply-To),
          5.3.3 (Replaces Header/Parameter), and 5.3.6 (Target-Dialog), for detailed discussion.</t>
        </section>


        <section title="Call-Info">

          <t>This field contains additional information about the user.</t>

          <t>A user agent executing a user-level privacy function on its own SHOULD NOT add a Call-Info header as indicated in Section 4.1 in RFC 3323.</t>

          <t>A privacy service MUST delete a Call-Info header if one exists when user privacy is requested with Privacy:user as indicated in Section 5.3 in RFC 3323.  A privacy service SHOULD NOT add a Call-Info header when user privacy is requested with Privacy:header as indicated in Section 5.1 in RFC 3323.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Contact">
          <t>This field contains a URI used to reach the user agent for mid-dialog requests and possibly out-of-dialog requests, such as REFER <xref target="RFC3315"></xref>.  Since the Contact header is essential for routing further requests to the user agent, it must include a functional URI even when it is anonymized.</t>

          <t>A user agent MUST NOT anonymize a Contact header field, unless it can obtain an IP address or contact address that is functional yet has characteristic of anonymity as indicated in Section 4.1.1.3 in RFC 3323.</t>

          <t>Since RFC 3323 was published, there have been proposals that allow UAs to obtain an IP address or contact address with a characteristic of anonymity.</t>

          <t>The mechanisms that are discussed at the time of this
          writing are Globally Routable User Agent URIs
          (GRUU) <xref target="SIP-GRUU"></xref>, which
          provide a functional Contact address with a short life span,
          making it ideal for privacy sensitive calls, and Traversal
          Using Relays around NAT
          (TURN) <xref target="BEHAVE-TURN"></xref>, through 
          which an IP address of a relay can be obtained for use in a Contact header field.</t>

          <t>A privacy service SHOULD anonymize a Contact header field by replacing the existing Contact header field value with the URI that dereferences to the privacy service when user privacy is requested with Privacy:header, as indicated in Section 5.1 in RFC 3323.  This is generally done by replacing the IP address or hostname with that of the privacy service.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="From">

          <t>This field contains the identity of the user, such as display-name and URI.</t>

          <t>A user agent executing a user-level privacy function on its own SHOULD anonymize a From header field using an anonymous display-name and an anonymous URI as indicated in Section 4.1 in RFC 3323.</t>

          <t>A privacy service should anonymize a From header field when user privacy is requested with Privacy:user.</t>

          <t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Note:">This does not prevent a privacy service from anonymizing the From header field based on local policy.</t></list></t>

          <t>The anonymous display-name and anonymous URI mentioned in this section use display-name "Anonymous", a URI with "anonymous" in the user portion of the From header field, and the hostname value "anonymous.invalid", as indicated in Section 4.1.1.3 in RFC 3323.</t>

          <t>The recommended form of the From header for anonymity is:</t>

          <t>From: "Anonymous" &lt;sip:anonymous@anonymous.invalid>;tag=1928301774</t>

          <t>The tag value varies from dialog to dialog, but the rest of this header form is recommended as shown.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="History-Info">
          <t>History-Info <xref target="RFC4244"></xref> header field URIs to which the request was forwarded or retargeted can reveal general routing information.</t>

          <t>A user agent executing a user-level privacy function on its own SHOULD NOT add a History-Info header as indicated in Section 3.3 in RFC 4244.</t>

          <t>A privacy service SHOULD delete the History-Info headers when user privacy is requested with Privacy:header, Privacy:session, or Privacy:history as indicated in Section 3.3 in RFC 4244.</t>

          <t>The privacy could be also expressed for a specific History-Info entry by inserting "privacy=history" in the History-Info header field.  In such a case, a privacy service SHOULD delete the History-Info entry as indicated in Section 4.3.3.1.1 in RFC 4244.</t>

          <t>Refer to <xref target="RFC4244"></xref> for detailed behavior for dealing with History-Info headers.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="In-Reply-To">

          <t>The In-Reply-To header field contains a Call-ID of the referenced dialog.  The replying user may be identified by the Call-ID in an In-Reply-To header field.</t>

          <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Alice > INV(Call-ID:C1) > Bob
Bob   > INV(In-Reply-To:C1) > Alice
          ]]></artwork></figure>

          <t>In this case, unless the In-Reply-To header is deleted, Alice might notice that the replying user is Bob because Alice's UA knows that the Call-ID relates to Bob.</t>

          <t>A user agent executing a user-level privacy function on its own should not add an In-Reply-To header as implied in Section 4.1 in RFC 3323.</t>

          <t>A privacy service MUST delete the In-Reply-To header when user privacy is requested with Privacy:user as indicated in Section 5.3 in RFC 3323.</t>

          <t>In addition, since an In-Reply-To header field contains
          the Call-ID of the dialog to which it is replying, special attention is required, as described in Section 5.1.1 (Call-ID), regardless of the priv-value or presence of a Privacy header.  Once a privacy service modifies a Call-ID in the request, a privacy service should restore the former value in an In-Reply-To header field, if present in the INVITE request replying to the original request, as long as the privacy service maintains the dialog state.</t>

          <t>A privacy service MUST delete the Organization header if one exists when user privacy is requested with Privacy:user as indicated in Section 5.3 in RFC 3323.

          <t>A privacy service MUST delete the P-Asserted-Identity headers when user privacy is requested with Privacy:id as indicated in Section 7 in RFC 3325 and should delete the P-Asserted-Identity headers when user privacy is requested with Privacy:header before it forwards the message to an entity that is not trusted.</t>

          <t>It is recommended for a privacy service to remove the P-Asserted-Identity header if user privacy is requested with Privacy:id or Privacy:header even when forwarding to a trusted entity, unless it can be confident that the message will not be routed to an untrusted entity without going through another privacy service.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Record-Route">

          <t>This field may reveal information about the administrative domain of the user.</t>

          <t>In order to hide Record-Route headers while keeping routability to the sender, privacy services can execute a practice referred to as "stripping".  Stripping means removing all the Record-Route headers that have been added to the request prior to its arrival at the privacy service and then adding a single Record-Route header representing itself.  In this case, the privacy service needs to retain the removed headers and restore them in a response.</t>

          <t>Alternatively, privacy services can remove the Record-Route headers and encrypt them into a single Record-Route header field.  In this case, the privacy service needs to decrypt the header field and restore the former values in a response.</t>

          <t>A privacy service SHOULD strip or encrypt any Record-Route headers that have been added to a message before it reaches the privacy service when user privacy is requested with Privacy:header as indicated in Section 5.1 in RFC 3323.</t>

          <t>As in the case of a Call-ID, if a privacy service modifies the Record-Route headers, it MUST be able to restore Route headers with retained values as indicated in Section 5.1 in RFC 3323.  Some examples where the restoration of the Route headers is necessary and unnecessary are given below.</t>

          <t>When a UAC (Alice) requires privacy for a request, a
          privacy service does not have to restore the Route headers
          in the subsequent request (see Example 1).</t>

          <t>On the other hand, when a UAS (User Agent Server) (Bob)
          requires privacy for a response, a privacy service has to
          restore the Route headers in the subsequent request (see Example 2).</t>

      <section anchor="non_target"
           title="Considerations for Non-Target SIP Headers/Parameters">

        <section title="Identity/Identity-Info">

          <t>The Identity <xref target="RFC4474"></xref> header field contains a signature used for validating the identity.  The Identity-Info header field contains a reference to the certificate of the signer of Identity headers.  An Identity-Info header may reveal information about the administrative domain of the user.</t>

          <t>The signature in an Identity header field provides integrity protection over the From, To, Call-ID, Cseq, Date, and Contact headers and over the message body.  The integrity protection is violated if a privacy service modifies these headers and/or the message body for the purpose of user privacy protection.</t>

          <t>Once those integrity-protected headers (such as From and Call-ID) are modified, the Identity/Identity-Info header fields are not valid any more. Thus, a privacy service acting on a request for Privacy:user, Privacy:header, or Privacy:session can invalidate integrity protection provided by an upstream authentication service that has inserted Identity/Identity-Info header fields. The use of such a privacy service should be avoided if integrity protect needs to be retained. Otherwise, if the privacy service invalidates the integrity protection, it should remove the Identity/Identity-Info header fields.</t>

          <t>An authentication service downstream of the privacy
          service may add Identity/Identity-Info header fields if the
          domain name of the From header field URI has not been
          anonymized (e.g., 'sip:anonymous@example.com'), which makes
          it possible for the service to authenticate the UAC.  This authenticated yet anonymous From header means "this is a known user in my domain that I have authenticated, but I am keeping its identity private" as indicated in Section 12 in RFC 4474.</t>

          <t>The desired deployment will have a privacy service located before or co-located with the identity service; thus, integrity and privacy can both be provided seamlessly.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Path">

          <t>This field may contain information about the administrative domain and/or the visited domain of the user agent.  However, the Path header is not the target of any priv-values.</t>

          <t>Given that the Path header [RFC3327] only appears in
          REGISTER requests/responses and is essential for a call to reach the registered UA in the visited domain, it serves no purpose to withhold or hide the information contained in the Path header field; rather, it is harmful.</t>

          <t>The only reason privacy may be considered desirable is if
          the visited domain wants to withhold its topology from the
          home domain of the user.  In doing so, the domain
          withholding the topology needs to ensure that it provides
          sufficient information so that the home domain can route the call to the visited domain, thus reaching the UA.</t>

          <t>However, anonymization of network-privacy-sensitive information is out of scope.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Replaces Header/Parameter">

          <t>The Replaces <xref target="RFC3891"></xref> header field and the "replaces" parameter contain identifiers of a dialog to be replaced, which are composed of Call-ID, local tag, and remote tag.</t>

          <t>The sender of the INVITE with a Replaces header is
          usually not the originating user agent or terminating user
          agent of the target dialog to be replaced.  Therefore, the
          Call-ID within the Replaces header field is unlikely to be
          generated by the sender, and thus this header is outside the anonymization target per priv-value.</t>

          <t>The "replaces" parameter, which appears in a Refer-To header field in a REFER request, is not the target of any particular priv-values either.  As described in Section 5.1.1 (Call-ID), regardless of the priv-value or the presence of a Privacy header, once a privacy service modifies a Call-ID in the request, it should monitor headers that may contain Call-ID and restore the portion of the value representing the modified Call-ID to the original Call-ID value in a Replaces header field received.</t>

          <t>The main challenge for this to function properly is that a privacy service has to be on a signaling path to the originator for every dialog.  This is generally not possible and results in REFER requests not functioning at all times.  This is a trade-off that is anticipated when privacy is imposed.</t>

          <t>The privacy requirements mentioned in Section 5.1.1 will cause the
Replaces header field and "replaces" parameter to contain values that
	    will fail the resulting dialog establishment in some
	    situations. This loss of functionality is allowed and/or
	    intended as illustrated above (i.e., it is not the responsibility of a privacy service to ensure that these features always work).</t>

          <t>The functionality of the Replaces header/parameter when anonymized depends on the circumstances in which it is used.  REFER may work or may not work depending on the following three criteria.</t>

          <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
1.  Who generated the Call-ID.
2.  Where the privacy service is on the signaling path.

          <t>A few examples that explore when the Replaces header/parameter works or fails are given below.</t>

        <section title="Route">

          <t>This field may contain information about the administrative domain of the user agent, but the Route header is not the target of any priv-values.</t>

          <t>Route headers appear only in SIP requests to force routing through the listed set of proxies.  If a privacy service anonymizes the Route header, the routing does not function.  Furthermore, there is no risk in revealing the information in the Route header fields to further network entities, including the terminating user agent, because a proxy removes the value from the Route header field when it replaces the value in the Request-URI, as defined in RFC 3261.</t>

          <t>A privacy service that modifies Record-Route header fields may need to restore the values in Route header fields as necessary.  As indicated in Section 5.1 in RFC 3323, if a privacy service modifies the Record-Route header fields, it MUST be able to restore Route header fields with retained values.

        <section title="Service-Route">

          <t>The Service-Route <xref target="RFC3608"></xref> header fields appear only in 200 OK responses to REGISTER requests and contain information about the registrar.  The purpose of the privacy mechanism defined in RFC 3323 is to secure the user's privacy, so the case where a registrar sets a Privacy header is not considered here.  Therefore, the Service-Route header is not the target of any priv-values.</t>

        <section title="Target-Dialog">

          <t>The Target-Dialog <xref target="RFC4538"></xref> header
          field faces exactly the same issues as seen for the Replaces
          header.  Please refer to Section 5.3.3 (Replaces Header/Parameter) for why this is not a target for any particular priv-values and how a privacy service still needs to evaluate and modify the value contained, even if no privacy is requested.</t>
