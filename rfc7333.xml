This document defines the requirements for Distributed Mobility
Management (DMM) at the network layer. The hierarchical structure 
in traditional wireless networks has led primarily to centrally
deployed mobility anchors. As some wireless networks are evolving
away from the hierarchical structure, it can be useful to have a
distributed model for mobility management in which traffic does not
need to traverse centrally deployed mobility anchors far from the
optimal route. The motivation and the problems addressed by each
requirement are also described.

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>
In the past decade, a fair number of network-layer mobility protocols 
have been standardized <xref target="RFC6275"/> <xref target="RFC5944"/>
<xref target="RFC5380"/> <xref target="RFC6301"/> <xref target="RFC5213"/>.
Although these protocols differ in terms of functions and associated
message formats, they all employ a mobility anchor to allow a mobile
node to remain reachable after it has moved to a different network. 
Among other tasks that the anchor point performs, the anchor point
ensures connectivity by forwarding packets destined to, or sent from,
the mobile node. It is a centrally deployed mobility anchor in
the sense that the deployed architectures today have a small number
of these anchors and the traffic of millions of mobile nodes in an
operator network is typically managed by the same anchor. Such a
mobility anchor may still have to reside in the subscriber's provider
network even when the subscriber is roaming to a visited network,
in order that certain functions such as charging and billing can be
performed more readily by the provider's network. An example provider
network is a Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) network. 
</t>

<t>
Distributed mobility management (DMM) is an alternative to the
above-mentioned centralized deployment. The background behind the
interest in studying DMM is primarily as follows.
</t>

<t>
<list style='format (%d)'>

<t>
More than ever, mobile users are consuming Internet content,
including that of local Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). 
Such traffic imposes new requirements 
on mobile core networks for data traffic delivery. 
To prevent exceeding the available core network capacity, 
service providers need to implement new strategies 
such as selective IPv4 traffic offload (e.g.,  <xref target="RFC6909"/>,
3GPP Local IP Access (LIPA) and Selected IP Traffic Offload
(SIPTO) work items <xref target="TS.23.401"/>) through alternative
access networks such as Wireless Local Area Networks
(WLANs) <xref target="MOB-DATA-OFFLOAD"/>. 
In addition, a gateway selection mechanism takes user proximity into
account within the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) <xref target="TS.29.303"/>. 
However, these mechanisms were not pursued in the past,
owing to charging and billing considerations that
require solutions beyond the mobility protocol.
Consequently, assigning a gateway anchor node
from a visited network when roaming to the visited network
has only recently been done and is limited
to voice services. 

<vspace blankLines="1" />

Both traffic offloading and CDN mechanisms 
could benefit from the development of mobile architectures 
with fewer hierarchical levels introduced into the data path 
by the mobility management system. 
This trend of "flattening" the mobile networks
works best for direct communications among peers 
in the same geographical area. 
Distributed mobility management in the flattening mobile networks
would anchor the traffic closer to the point of attachment of the
user.
</t>

<t>
Today's mobile networks present service providers with new challenges.
Mobility patterns indicate that mobile nodes often
remain attached to the same point of attachment
for considerable periods of time <xref target="LOCATING-USER"/>.
Specific IP mobility management support is not required for
applications that launch and complete their sessions 
while the mobile node is connected to the same point of attachment.
However, IP mobility support is currently designed for always-on
operation, maintaining all parameters of the context 
for each mobile subscriber for as long as they are connected to the
network. This can result in a waste of resources 
and unnecessary costs for the service provider. 
Infrequent node mobility coupled with application intelligence
suggest that mobility support could be provided selectively,
e.g., as described in <xref target="DHCPv6-CLASS-BASED-PREFIX"/>
and <xref target="IPv6-PREFIX-PROPERTIES"/>, thus reducing the amount
of context maintained in the network.
</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>
DMM may distribute the mobility anchors 
in the data plane in flattening the mobility network
such that the mobility anchors are positioned 
closer to the user; ideally, mobility agents could be collocated 
with the first-hop router.
Facilitated by the distribution of mobility anchors,
it may be possible to selectively use or not use
mobility protocol support, depending on whether such support
is needed or not. DMM can thus reduce the amount of state information
that must be maintained in various mobility agents of the mobile network
and can then avoid the unnecessary establishment of mechanisms to
forward traffic from an old mobility anchor to a new mobility anchor.

<section anchor="compare" title="Centralized versus Distributed Mobility Management">
<t>
Mobility management is needed because the IP address of a mobile node
may change as the node moves. Mobility management functions 
may be implemented at different layers of the protocol stack. 
At the IP (network) layer, mobility management can be client-based or
network-based. 
</t>

<t>
An IP-layer mobility management protocol is typically based on the
principle of distinguishing between a session identifier and a
forwarding address and maintaining a mapping between the two. 
In Mobile IP, the new IP address of the mobile node after the node has
moved is the forwarding address, whereas the original IP address
before the mobile node moves serves as the session identifier.
The location management (LM) information is kept by associating the
forwarding address with the session identifier. 
Packets addressed to the session identifier will first route to the
original network, which redirects them using the forwarding address
to deliver to the session. Redirecting packets this way can result in
long routes. An existing optimization routes directly, using the
forwarding address of the host, and as such is a host-based solution.
</t>

<t>
The next two subsections explain centralized and distributed
mobility management functions in the network.
</t>

<section anchor="central" title="Centralized Mobility Management">
<t>
In centralized mobility management, the location information in
terms of a mapping between the session identifier 
and the forwarding address is kept at a single mobility anchor, 
and packets destined to the session identifier are forwarded via
this anchor. In other words, such mobility management systems are
centralized in both the control plane and the data plane
(mobile node IP traffic).
</t>

<t>
Many existing mobility management deployments make use of
centralized mobility anchoring in a hierarchical network architecture, 
as shown in <xref target="fig1"/>. Examples are the home agent (HA) 
and local mobility anchor (LMA) serving as the anchors for the
mobile node (MN) and mobile access gateway (MAG) in Mobile IPv6 
<xref target="RFC6275"/> and in Proxy Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC5213"/>,
respectively. Cellular networks, such as 3GPP
General Packet Radio System (GPRS) networks and 3GPP
Evolved Packet System (EPS) networks, also employ centralized mobility
management. In the 3GPP GPRS network, the Gateway GPRS Support Node
(GGSN), Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN), and
Radio Network Controller (RNC) constitute a hierarchy of anchors.
In the 3GPP EPS network, the Packet Data Network Gateway (P-GW) 
and Serving Gateway (S-GW) constitute another hierarchy of anchors.

<t>
DMM is distributed in the data plane, whereas the control plane may
be either centralized or distributed <xref target="DMM-SCENARIO"/>.
The former case implicitly assumes separation of data and control planes
as described in <xref target="PMIP-CP-UP-SPLIT"/>.
While mobility management can be distributed, it is not necessary 
for other functions such as subscription management, subscription
databases, and network access authentication to be similarly
distributed.
</t>

<t>
A distributed mobility management scheme for a flattening mobile
network consisting of access nodes is proposed in 
<xref target="DIST-DYNAMIC-MOB"/>.
Its benefits over centralized mobility management 
have been shown through simulations  
<xref target="DIST-CENTRAL-MOB"/>.
Moreover, the (re)use and extension of existing protocols 
in the design of both fully distributed mobility management
<xref target="MIGRATING-HAs"/> <xref target="DIST-MOB-SAE"/>
and partially distributed mobility management
<xref target="DIST-MOB-PMIP"/> <xref target="DIST-MOB-MIP"/>
have been reported in the literature. Therefore, before designing
new mobility management protocols for a future distributed
architecture, it is recommended to first consider whether existing
mobility management protocols can be extended. 

</t>

</section>

</section>

<section anchor="problem" title="Problem Statement">
<t>
The problems that can be addressed with DMM are summarized as follows:
</t>

<t>
<list style='format PS%d:' counter="PS_count">

<!-- PS1 -->
<t>
Non-optimal routes
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Forwarding via a centralized anchor often results in non-optimal
routes, thereby increasing the end-to-end delay.
The problem is manifested, for example, when accessing a nearby
server or servers of a Content Delivery Network (CDN), or when
receiving locally available IP multicast packets or sending
IP multicast packets. (Existing route optimization is only a
host-based solution. On the other hand, localized routing with PMIPv6
<xref target="RFC6705"/> addresses only a part of the problem 
where both the MN and the correspondent node (CN) are attached to
the same MAG, and it is not applicable when the CN does not behave
like an MN.)
</t>

<!-- PS2 -->
<t>
Divergence from other evolutionary trends in network architectures
such as distribution of content delivery
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Mobile networks have generally been evolving towards a flatter and
flatter network. Centralized mobility management, which is
non-optimal with a flatter network architecture, does not support
this evolution.
</t>

<!-- PS3 -->
<t>
Lack of scalability of centralized tunnel management 
and mobility context maintenance
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Setting up tunnels through a central anchor and
maintaining mobility context for each MN 
usually requires more concentrated resources
in a centralized design, thus reducing scalability. 
Distributing the tunnel maintenance function 
and the mobility context maintenance function 
among different network entities with proper signaling
protocol design can avoid increasing the concentrated resources
with an increasing number of MNs.
</t>

<!-- PS4 -->
<t>
Single point of failure and attack
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Centralized anchoring designs may be more vulnerable 
to a single point of failure and attacks than a distributed system.
The impact of a successful attack on a system with centralized
mobility management can be far greater as well.
</t>

<!-- PS5 -->
<t>
Unnecessary mobility support 
to clients that do not need it
<vspace blankLines="1" />
IP mobility support is usually provided to all MNs.
However, it is not always required, and not every parameter of
mobility context is always used. For example, 
some applications or nodes do not need a stable IP address 
during a handover to maintain session continuity. 
Sometimes, the entire application session runs 
while the MN does not change the point of attachment. 
Besides, some sessions, e.g., SIP-based sessions, 
can handle mobility at the application layer 
and hence do not need IP mobility support; 
it is then unnecessary to provide IP mobility support
for such sessions.
</t>

<!-- PS6 -->
<t>
Mobility signaling overhead 
with peer-to-peer communication
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Resources may be wasted when mobility signaling 
(e.g., maintenance of the tunnel, keep-alive signaling, etc.)
is not turned off for peer-to-peer communication. 
</t>

<!-- PS7 -->
<t>
Deployment with multiple mobility solutions
<vspace blankLines="1" />
There are already many variants and extensions of MIP
as well as mobility solutions at other layers. 
Deployment of new mobility management solutions can be challenging, 
and debugging difficult, when they coexist with solutions already
deployed in the field.
</t>

<!-- PS8 -->
<t>
Duplicate multicast traffic
<vspace blankLines="1" />
IP multicast distribution over architectures using
IP mobility solutions (e.g., <xref target="RFC6224"/>) 
may lead to convergence of duplicated multicast subscriptions 
towards the downstream tunnel entity (e.g., MAG in PMIPv6).
Concretely, when multicast subscription for individual mobile nodes
is coupled with mobility tunnels (e.g., a PMIPv6 tunnel), duplicate
multicast subscription(s) is prone to be received through
different upstream paths. This problem may also exist 
or be more severe in a distributed mobility environment. 
</t>
</list>
</t>

</section>


<section anchor="reqs" title="Requirements">
<t>
Now that distributed mobility management has been compared with
centralized deployment (<xref target="compare"/>) and the problems
have been described (<xref target="problem"/>), this section
identifies the following requirements:
</t>

<!-- REQ1 -->
<t>
<list style='format REQ%d:' counter="R_count">
<t>
Distributed mobility management
<vspace blankLines="1" />
IP mobility, network access solutions, and forwarding solutions
provided by DMM MUST enable traffic to avoid traversing a single
mobility anchor far from the optimal route.

<vspace blankLines="1" />

This requirement on distribution applies to the data plane only. 
It does not impose constraints on whether the control plane should
be distributed or centralized. However, if the control plane is
centralized while the data plane is distributed, it is implied that
the control plane and data plane need to separate (<xref target="dist"/>).

<vspace blankLines="1" />

Motivation: 
This requirement is motivated by current trends in network evolution:
(a) it is cost- and resource-effective to cache contents, 
and the caching (e.g., CDN) servers are distributed
so that each user in any location can be close to one of the servers;
(b) the significantly larger number of mobile nodes and flows
call for improved scalability; (c) single points of failure are
avoided in a distributed system; and (d) threats against centrally
deployed anchors, e.g., a home agent and a local mobility anchor,
are mitigated in a distributed system. 

<vspace blankLines="1" />

This requirement addresses the problems 
PS1, PS2, PS3, and PS4 described in <xref target="problem"/>.
</t>
</list>
</t>


<!-- REQ2 -->
<t>
<list style='format REQ%d:' counter="R_count">
<t>
Bypassable network-layer mobility support for each application session
<vspace blankLines="1" />
DMM solutions MUST enable network-layer mobility, but it MUST be
possible for any individual active application session (flow)
to not use it. 

Mobility support is needed, for example, 
when a mobile host moves and an application 
cannot cope with a change in the IP address.

Mobility support is also needed 
when a mobile router changes its IP address
as it moves together with a host
and, in the presence of ingress filtering,
an application in the host is interrupted.

However, mobility support at the network layer is not always needed;
a mobile node can often be stationary, and mobility support can also
be provided at other layers. It is then not always necessary to
maintain a stable IP address or prefix for an active application
session.
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Different active sessions can also differ in whether
network-layer mobility support is needed. IP mobility,
network access solutions, and forwarding solutions provided by
DMM MUST then provide the possibility of independent handling
for each application session of a user or mobile device.
<vspace blankLines="1" />
The handling of mobility management to the granularity of an
individual session of a user/device SHOULD need proper session
identification in addition to user/device identification.
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Motivation:
The motivation of this requirement is to enable more efficient
forwarding and more efficient use of network resources 
by selecting an IP address or prefix according to whether
mobility support is needed and by not maintaining context 
at the mobility anchor when there is no such need.

<vspace blankLines="1" />

This requirement addresses the problems 
PS5 and PS6 described in <xref target="problem"/>.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<!-- REQ3 -->
<t>
<list style='format REQ%d:' counter="R_count">
<t>
IPv6 deployment
<vspace blankLines="1" />
DMM solutions SHOULD target IPv6 as the primary deployment
environment and SHOULD NOT be tailored specifically to support IPv4,
particularly in situations where private IPv4 addresses
and/or NATs are used.
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Motivation:
This requirement conforms to the general orientation of IETF work. 
DMM deployment is foreseen as "on the mid- to long-term horizon",
when IPv6 is expected to be far more common than today.

<vspace blankLines="1" />
This requirement avoids the unnecessarily complex solution 
of trying to provide the same level of functionality to
both IPv4 and IPv6. Some of the IPv6-specific features are
not available for IPv4.

</list>
</t>


<!-- REQ4 -->
<t>
<list style='format REQ%d:' counter="R_count">
<t>
Existing mobility protocols
<vspace blankLines="1" />
A DMM solution MUST first consider reusing and extending 
IETF standard protocols before specifying new protocols.
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Motivation:
Reuse of existing IETF work is more efficient and less error-prone.

<vspace blankLines="1" />

This requirement attempts to avoid the need for development of
new protocols and therefore their potential for being
time-consuming and error-prone.
</t>
</list>
</t>


<!-- REQ5 -->
<t>
<list style='format REQ%d:' counter="R_count">
<t>
Coexistence with deployed networks/hosts
and operability across different networks

<vspace blankLines="1" />

A DMM solution may require loose, tight, or no integration
into existing mobility protocols and host IP stacks.
Regardless of the integration level, DMM implementations MUST
be able to coexist with existing network deployments,
end hosts, and routers that may or may not implement existing
mobility protocols. Furthermore, a DMM solution SHOULD work
across different networks, possibly operated as separate
administrative domains, when the needed mobility management
signaling, forwarding, and network access 
are allowed by the trust relationship between them. 

<vspace blankLines="1" />

Motivation: 
to (a) preserve backwards compatibility 
so that existing networks and hosts 
are not affected and continue to function as usual, and 
(b) enable inter-domain operation if desired.

<vspace blankLines="1" />

This requirement addresses

Operation and management considerations

<vspace blankLines="1" />

A DMM solution needs to consider configuring a device,
monitoring the current operational state of a device, and
responding to events that impact the device, possibly by
modifying the configuration and storing the data in a format 
that can be analyzed later. Different management protocols are
available. For example:

<list style='format (%c)' counter="REQ6_count1">

<t>
the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
<xref target="RFC1157"/>, with definitions of standardized 
management information base (MIB) objects for DMM
that allow the monitoring of traffic steering in a
consistent manner across different devices
</t>
<t>
the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) <xref target="RFC6241"/>,
with definitions of standardized YANG <xref target="RFC6020"/>
modules for DMM to achieve a standardized configuration
</t>
<t>
syslog <xref target="RFC5424"/>, which is a one-way protocol
allowing a device to report significant events
to a log analyzer in a network management system
</t>
<t>
the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Protocol,
which serves as a means for transmitting 
traffic flow information over the network <xref target="RFC7011"/>,
with a formal description of IPFIX Information Elements 
<xref target="RFC7012"/>
</t>
</list>

<vspace blankLines="1" />

It is not the goal of this requirements document to impose which
management protocol(s) should be used. An inventory of the management
protocols and data models is covered in <xref target="RFC6632"/>.

<vspace blankLines="1" />

The following paragraphs list the operation and management
considerations required for a DMM solution; this list of
considerations may not be exhaustive and may be expanded 
according to the needs of the solutions:

<vspace blankLines="1" />

A DMM solution MUST describe how, and in what types of
environments, it can be scalably deployed and managed.

<vspace blankLines="1" />

A DMM solution MUST support mechanisms to test whether the DMM
solution is working properly. For example, when a DMM solution
employs traffic indirection to support a mobility session,
implementations MUST support mechanisms to test that the
appropriate traffic indirection operations are in place,
including the setup of traffic indirection and the subsequent
teardown of the indirection to release the associated network
resources when the mobility session has closed. 

<vspace blankLines="1" />

A DMM solution SHOULD expose the operational state of DMM
to the administrators of the DMM entities. For example, 
when a DMM solution employs separation between a
session identifier and forwarding address, it should expose
the association between them.

<vspace blankLines="1" />

When flow mobility is supported by a DMM solution,
the solution SHOULD support means to correlate
the flow routing policies and the observed forwarding actions.

<vspace blankLines="1" />

A DMM solution SHOULD support mechanisms to check the liveness
of a forwarding path. If the DMM solution sends periodic update
refresh messages to configure the forwarding path,
the refresh period SHOULD be configurable 
and a reasonable default configuration value proposed.

Information collected can be logged or made available with protocols 
such as SNMP 
<xref target="RFC1157"/>,
NETCONF
<xref target="RFC6241"/>,
IPFIX
<xref target="RFC7011"/>,
or syslog
<xref target="RFC5424"/>.

<vspace blankLines="1" />

A DMM solution MUST provide fault management and monitoring
mechanisms to manage situations where an update of the mobility
session or the data path fails. The system must also be able to
handle situations where a mobility anchor with ongoing mobility
sessions fails.

<vspace blankLines="1" />

A DMM solution SHOULD be able to monitor usage of the DMM protocol.
When a DMM solution uses an existing protocol, the techniques
already defined for that protocol SHOULD be used to monitor
the DMM operation. When these techniques are inadequate,
new techniques MUST be developed. 

<vspace blankLines="1" />

In particular, the DMM solution SHOULD

<list style='format (%c)' counter="REQ6_count2">

<t>
be able to monitor the number of mobility sessions per user,
as well as their average duration
</t>

<t>
provide an indication of DMM performance, such as 

<list style='format (%d)'>
<t>
handover delay, which includes the time necessary to reestablish
the forwarding path when the point of attachment changes
</t>
<t>
protocol reactivity, which is the time between handover events 
such as the attachment to a new access point and the completion of
the mobility session update
</t>
</list>

</t>

<t>
provide means to measure the signaling cost of the DMM protocol
</t>

<t>
if tunneling is used for traffic redirection, monitor

<list style='format (%d)'>
<t>
the number of tunnels
</t>
<t>their transmission and reception information
</t>
<t>the encapsulation method used, and its overhead
</t>
<t>the security used at the node level
</t>
</list>

</t>
</list>

<vspace blankLines="1" />

DMM solutions SHOULD support standardized configuration
with NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/>,
using YANG <xref target="RFC6020"/> modules,
which SHOULD be created for DMM when needed for such configuration.

However, if a DMM solution creates extensions to MIPv6 or PMIPv6,
the allowed addition of definitions of management information base
(MIB) objects to the MIPv6 MIB <xref target="RFC4295"/>
or the PMIPv6 MIB <xref target="RFC6475"/> that are needed
for the control and monitoring of the protocol extensions
SHOULD be limited to read-only objects.

<vspace blankLines="1" />

Motivation:
A DMM solution that is designed from the beginning for
operability and manageability can implement efficient
operations and management solutions.

<vspace blankLines="1" />

These requirements avoid DMM designs that make operations and
management difficult or costly.

<!-- REQ7 -->
<t>
<list style='format REQ%d:' counter="R_count">
<t>
Security considerations
<vspace blankLines="1" />
A DMM solution MUST support any security protocols and mechanisms
needed to secure the network and to make continuous security
improvements. In addition, with security taken into consideration 
early in the design, a DMM solution MUST NOT introduce new security
risks or amplify existing security risks that cannot be mitigated by
existing security protocols and mechanisms. 
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Motivation:
Various attacks such as impersonation, denial of service, 
man-in-the-middle attacks, and so on may be launched in a DMM
deployment. For instance, an illegitimate node may attempt to
access a network providing DMM. Another example is that a malicious
node can forge a number of signaling messages, thus redirecting
traffic from its legitimate path. Consequently, the specific
node or nodes to which the traffic is redirected may be under a
denial-of-service attack and other nodes do not receive their
traffic. Accordingly, security mechanisms/protocols providing
access control, integrity, authentication, authorization,
confidentiality, etc.&nbsp;should be used to protect the DMM entities 
as they are already used to protect existing networks and existing
mobility protocols defined in the IETF. However, if a candidate DMM
solution is such that these existing security mechanisms/protocols are
unable to provide sufficient security protection even when properly used,
then that candidate DMM solution is causing uncontrollable security
problems.

<vspace blankLines="1" />

This requirement prevents a DMM solution from introducing
uncontrollable problems of potentially insecure mobility
management protocols that make deployment infeasible,
because platforms conforming to such protocols are at risk
for data loss and numerous other dangers, including financial
harm to the users. 
</t>

</t>


<!-- REQ8 -->
<t>
<list style='format REQ%d:' counter="R_count">
<t>
Multicast considerations
<vspace blankLines="1" />
DMM SHOULD enable multicast solutions to be developed to
avoid network inefficiency in multicast traffic delivery.
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Motivation:
Existing multicast deployments have been introduced after
completing the design of the reference mobility protocol, 
often leading to network inefficiency and non-optimal forwarding
for the multicast traffic. DMM should instead consider multicast
early in the process, so that the multicast solutions can better
consider the efficient nature of multicast traffic delivery
(such as duplicate multicast subscriptions towards the
downstream tunnel entities). The multicast solutions should then 
avoid restricting the management of all IP multicast traffic 
to a single host through a dedicated (tunnel) interface 
on multicast-capable access routers. 

<vspace blankLines="1" />

This requirement addresses the problems 
PS1 and PS8 described in <xref target="problem"/>.
