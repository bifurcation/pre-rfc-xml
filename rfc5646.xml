			<t>This document describes the structure, content, construction, and
  semantics of language tags for use in cases where it is desirable to indicate 
  the language used in an information object. It also describes how to register 
  values for use in language tags and the creation of user-defined extensions for private interchange.</t>

		<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
			<t>Human beings on our planet have, past and present, used a number of languages. 
There are many reasons why one would want to identify the language used when 
presenting or requesting information.</t>

	<t>The language of an information item or a user's language preferences often need to be identified
so that appropriate processing can be applied. For example, the user's language
preferences in a Web browser can be used to select Web pages
	  appropriately. Language information can also be used to
	  select among tools (such as dictionaries) to assist in the
	  processing or understanding of content in different
	  languages. Knowledge about the particular language used by
	  some piece of information content might be useful or even
	  required by some types of processing, for example,
	  spell-checking, computer-synthesized speech, Braille
	  transcription, or high-quality print renderings.</t>
			
	<t>One means of indicating the language used is by labeling the information content 
with an identifier or "tag". These tags can also be used to specify
	  the user's preferences when selecting information content
	  or to label additional attributes of content and associated resources.</t>

	<t>Sometimes language tags are used to indicate additional
	language attributes of content. For example, indicating
	specific information about the dialect, writing system, or
	orthography used in a document or resource may enable the user
	to obtain information in a form that they can understand, or
	it can be important in processing or rendering the given
	content into an appropriate form or style.</t>

	<t>This document specifies a particular identifier mechanism
	(the language tag) and a registration function for values to
	be used to form tags. It also defines a mechanism for private
	use values and future extensions.</t>

	<t>This document replaces <xref target="RFC4646"/> (which
obsoleted <xref target="RFC3066"></xref> which, in turn, replaced <xref target="RFC1766"></xref>). This
	document, in combination with <xref target="RFC4647"></xref>,
	comprises BCP 47. For a list of changes in
	this document, see <xref target="changes"/>.</t>

			<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", 
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t></section>

		<section title="The Language Tag" anchor="langtag">

	<t>Language tags are used to help identify languages, whether
	spoken, written, signed, or otherwise signaled, for the
	purpose of communication. This includes constructed and
	artificial languages but excludes languages not intended
	primarily for human communication, such as programming
	languages.</t>

		<section title="Syntax" anchor="syntax">

	<t>A language tag is composed from a sequence of one or more
	"subtags", each of which refines or narrows the range of
	language identified by the overall tag. Subtags, in turn, are
	a sequence of alphanumeric characters (letters and digits),
	distinguished and separated from other subtags in a tag by a
	hyphen ("-", <xref target="Unicode"></xref> U+002D).</t>

	<t>There are different types of subtag, each of which is
	distinguished by length, position in the tag, and content:
	each subtag's type can be recognized solely by these
	features. This makes it possible to extract and assign some
	semantic information to the subtags, even if the specific
	subtag values are not recognized. Thus, a language tag
	processor need not have a list of valid tags or subtags (that
	is, a copy of some version of the IANA Language Subtag
	Registry) in order to perform common searching and matching
	operations. The only exceptions to this ability to infer
	meaning from subtag structure are the grandfathered tags
	listed in the productions 'regular' and 'irregular'
	below. These tags were registered
	under <xref target="RFC3066"></xref> and are a fixed list that
	can never change.</t>

	<t>For examples of language tags, see
	<xref target="examples"/>.</t><t>All subtags have a maximum
	length of eight characters. Whitespace is not permitted in
	a language tag. There is a subtlety in the ABNF production
	'variant': a variant starting with a digit has a minimum
	length of four characters, while those starting with a letter
	have a minimum length of five characters. </t>

	<t>Although <xref target="RFC5234"/> refers to octets,
    the language tags described in this document are sequences of characters
    from the US-ASCII <xref target="ISO646"/> repertoire. Language tags MAY be used in documents and
    applications that use other encodings, so long as these encompass the relevant part of the US-ASCII
    repertoire. An example of this would be an XML document that uses
    the UTF-16LE <xref target="RFC2781"/> encoding of
    <xref target="Unicode"/>.</t>


       <section title="Formatting of Language Tags" anchor="casing">
    <t>At all times, language tags and their subtags, including
    private use and extensions, are to be treated as case insensitive: there exist conventions for the 
    capitalization of some of the subtags, but these MUST NOT be taken to carry meaning.</t>
				
				<t>   
    Thus, the tag "mn-Cyrl-MN" is not distinct from "MN-cYRL-mn" or
    "mN-cYrL-Mn" (or any other combination), and each of these
    variations conveys the same meaning: Mongolian written in the
    Cyrillic script as used in Mongolia. </t>

    <t> The ABNF syntax also does not distinguish between upper- and lowercase: the uppercase
    US-ASCII letters in the range 'A' through 'Z' are always
    considered equivalent and mapped directly to their US-ASCII
    lowercase equivalents in the range 'a' through 'z'. So the tag
    "I-AMI" is considered equivalent to that value "i-ami" in the
    'irregular' production.</t>

    <t>Although case distinctions do not carry meaning in language
    tags, consistent formatting and presentation of language tags will
    aid users. The format of subtags in the registry is RECOMMENDED as
    the form to use in language tags. This format generally
    corresponds to the common conventions for the various ISO
    standards from which the subtags are derived. </t>


   <t>These conventions include:<list style="symbols">

		<t><xref target="ISO639-1"/> recommends that language
      codes be written in lowercase ('mn' Mongolian).</t>
			
		<t><xref target="ISO15924"/> recommends that script
      codes use lowercase with the initial letter capitalized ('Cyrl'
      Cyrillic).</t>

              <t><xref target="ISO3166-1"/> recommends that country
              codes be capitalized ('MN' Mongolia).</t>
						
					</list>
	</t><t>An implementation can reproduce this format without
	accessing the registry as follows. All subtags, including
	extension and private use subtags, use lowercase letters with
	two exceptions: two-letter and four-letter subtags that
	neither appear at the start of the tag nor occur after
	singletons. Such two-letter subtags are all uppercase (as in
	the tags "en-CA-x-ca" or "sgn-BE-FR") and four-letter subtags
	are titlecase (as in the tag "az-Latn-x-latn").</t>

				
	<t>Note: Case folding of ASCII letters in certain locales,
	unless carefully handled, sometimes produces non-ASCII
	character values. The Unicode Character Database file
	"SpecialCasing.txt" <xref target="SpecialCasing"></xref> defines the specific cases that are known
to cause problems with this. In particular, the letter 'i'
	(U+0069) in Turkish and Azerbaijani is uppercased to U+0130
	(LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE). Implementers SHOULD
	specify a locale-neutral casing operation to ensure that case
	folding of subtags does not produce this value, which is
	illegal in language tags. For example, if one were to
	uppercase the region subtag 'in' using Turkish locale rules,
	the sequence U+0130 U+004E would result, instead of the
	expected 'IN'.</t></section></section>

	<section anchor="sources" title="Language Subtag Sources and Interpretation">

	<t>The namespace of language tags and their subtags is administered by the 
     Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) according 
     to the rules in <xref target="iana"/> of this document. The Language Subtag Registry maintained
     by IANA is the source for valid subtags: other standards referenced in this
     section provide the source material for that registry.</t>

	<t>Terminology used in this document:</t>
	<t>	<list style="symbols">
		<t>"Tag" refers to a complete language tag, such as "sr-Latn-RS" or "az-Arab-IR".
        Examples of tags in this document are enclosed in double-quotes ("en-US").</t>
		
		<t>"Subtag" refers to a specific section of a tag,
        delimited by a hyphen, such as the subtags 'zh', 'Hant', and
        'CN' in the tag "zh-Hant-CN". Examples of subtags in this 
        document are enclosed in single quotes ('Hant').</t>

		<t>"Code" refers to values defined in external standards (and that
        are used as subtags in this document). For example, 
        'Hant' is an <xref target="ISO15924"/> script 
        code that was used to define the 'Hant' script subtag for use in 
        a language tag. Examples of codes in this document are enclosed in 
        single quotes ('en', 'Hant').</t>
					</list>
				</t>
				
	<t>Language tags are designed so that each subtag type has unique length and 
     content restrictions. These make
     identification of the subtag's type possible, even if the content of
     the subtag itself is unrecognized. This allows tags to be parsed and 
     processed without reference to the latest version of the underlying 
     standards or the IANA registry and makes the associated exception 
     handling when parsing tags simpler.</t>

	<t>Some of the subtags in the IANA registry do not come from an underlying standard. These
     can only appear in specific positions in a tag: they can only
     occur as primary language subtags or as variant subtags.</t>

	<t>Sequences of private use and extension subtags MUST 
     occur at the end of the sequence of subtags and MUST NOT be 
     interspersed with subtags defined elsewhere in this
     document. These sequences are introduced by single-character
     subtags, which are reserved as follows:<list style="symbols">

	<t>The single-letter subtag 'x' introduces a sequence of 
           private use subtags. The interpretation of any private use subtag is 
           defined solely by private agreement and is not defined by the rules 
           in this section or in any standard or registry defined in this document.</t>
						
	<t>The single-letter subtag 'i' is used by some grandfathered
           tags, such as "i-default", where it always appears in the
           first position and cannot be confused with an
           extension.</t>

	<t>All other single-letter and single-digit subtags are reserved to introduce standardized
           extension subtag sequences as described in <xref target="extensions"/>.</t></list></t>
				
	<section anchor="primarylang" title="Primary Language Subtag">

	<t>The primary language subtag is the first subtag in a
	language tag and cannot be omitted, with two
	exceptions:
        <list style="symbols"><t>The single-character
	subtag 'x' as the primary subtag indicates that the language
	tag consists solely of subtags whose meaning is defined by
	private agreement. For example, in the tag "x-fr-CH", the
	subtags 'fr' and 'CH' do not represent the French language or
	the country of Switzerland (or any other value in the IANA
	registry) unless there is a private agreement in place to do
	so. See <xref target="privateuse"/>.</t>

	<t>The single-character subtag 'i' is used by some
	grandfathered tags (see <xref target="preexisreg"/>) such as
	"i-klingon" and "i-bnn". (Other grandfathered tags have a
	primary language subtag in their first
	position.)</t></list></t>

       <t>The following rules apply to the primary language subtag:</t>

		<t>	<list style="numbers">
		<t>Two-character primary language subtags were defined in the IANA registry
        according to the assignments found in the standard "ISO
        639-1:2002, Codes for the representation of names of languages
        -- Part 1: Alpha-2 code" <xref target="ISO639-1"/>, or using
        assignments subsequently made by the ISO 639-1 registration
        authority (RA) or governing standardization bodies.</t>

		<t>Three-character primary language subtags in the IANA registry were defined according 
        to the assignments found in one of these additional ISO 639
        parts or assignments subsequently made by the relevant ISO 639
        registration authorities or governing standardization bodies:

           <list style="letters"><t>"ISO 639-2:1998 - Codes for the
	       representation of names of languages -- Part 2: Alpha-3
	       code - edition 1" <xref target="ISO639-2"/></t><t>"ISO
	       639-3:2007 - Codes for the representation of names of
	       languages -- Part 3: Alpha-3 code for comprehensive
	       coverage of languages"
	       <xref target="ISO639-3"/></t><t>"ISO 639-5:2008 - Codes

	       Alpha-3 code for language families and
	       groups" <xref target="ISO639-5"></xref></t></list> </t>

	<t>The subtags in the range 'qaa' through 'qtz' are reserved for private use 
        in language tags. These subtags correspond to codes
        reserved by ISO 639-2 for private use. These codes MAY be used for
        non-registered primary language subtags
        (instead of using private use subtags following 'x-'). Please refer to
        <xref target="privateuse"/> for more information on private use subtags.
        </t>

	<t>Four-character language subtags are reserved for possible future standardization.</t>

	<t>Any language subtags of five to eight characters 
        in length in the IANA registry were defined via the registration process in 
        <xref target="registrationProc"/> and MAY be used to form the primary language subtag. 
        An example of what such a registration might include is the grandfathered IANA registration
           "i-enochian". The subtag 'enochian' could be registered 
           in the IANA registry as a primary language subtag
           (assuming that ISO 639 does not register this language first), 
           making tags such as "enochian-AQ" and "enochian-Latn"
        valid.<vspace blankLines="1"/>At the time this document was
        created, there were no examples of this kind of subtag. Future registrations of this type are
discouraged: an attempt to register any new proposed primary language
        MUST be made to the ISO 639 registration authority. Proposals
        rejected by the ISO 639 registration authority are unlikely to
        meet the criteria for primary language subtags and are thus
        unlikely to be registered.</t>

							
	<t>Other values MUST NOT be assigned to the primary subtag except by 
        revision or update of this document.</t>
						</list>
					</t>
	<t>When languages have both an ISO 639-1 two-character code 
     and a three-character code (assigned by ISO 639-2, ISO 639-3, or
     ISO 639-5), only the ISO 639-1 two-character code is defined in
     the IANA registry.</t>

	<t>When a language has no ISO 639-1 two-character code and 
     the ISO 639-2/T (Terminology) code and the ISO 639-2/B 
     (Bibliographic) code for that language differ, only the Terminology code is defined in
     the IANA registry. 
     At the time this document was created, all languages that 
     had both kinds of three-character 
     codes were also assigned a two-character code; it is expected that
     future assignments of this nature will not occur.</t>

	<t>In order to avoid instability in the canonical form of tags, if a
two-character code is added to ISO 639-1 for a language for which a
three-character code was already included in either ISO 639-2 or ISO 639-3, the two-character code
MUST NOT be registered. See <xref target="ianastability"/>.</t>

	<t>For example, if some content were tagged with
      'haw' (Hawaiian), which currently has no two-character code, the tag
      would not need to be changed if ISO 639-1 were to assign a two-character code
      to the Hawaiian language at a later date.</t>

     <t>To avoid these problems with versioning and subtag choice
     (as experienced during the transition between RFC 1766 and RFC 3066), as
     well as to ensure the canonical nature of subtags defined by this document, the 
      ISO 639 Registration Authority Joint Advisory Committee (ISO 639/RA-JAC) has
      included the following statement in <xref target="iso639.prin"/>:<list>
	
	<t>"A language code already in ISO 639-2 at the point of freezing 
      ISO 639-1 shall not later be added to ISO 639-1. This is to 
      ensure consistency in usage over time, since users are directed 
      in Internet applications to employ the alpha-3 code when an 
      alpha-2 code for that language is not available."</t>

				<section anchor="extlang" title="Extended Language Subtags">
	<t>Extended language subtags are used to identify certain
	specially selected languages that, for various historical and
	compatibility reasons, are closely identified with or tagged
	using an existing primary language subtag. Extended language
	subtags are always used with their enclosing primary language
	subtag (indicated with a 'Prefix' field in the registry) when
used to form the language tag. All languages that have an
	extended language subtag in the registry also have an
	identical primary language subtag record in the registry. This
	primary language subtag is RECOMMENDED for forming the
	language tag. The following rules apply to the extended
	language subtags:

        <list style="numbers"><t>Extended language
	subtags consist solely of three-letter subtags. All extended
	language subtag records defined in the registry  were defined
	according to the assignments found
	in <xref target="ISO639-3"></xref>. Language collections and
	groupings, such as defined in <xref target="ISO639-5"></xref>,
	are specifically excluded from being extended language
	subtags.</t>

        <t>Extended language subtag records MUST include
	exactly one 'Prefix' field indicating an appropriate subtag or
	sequence of subtags for that extended language
	subtag.</t><t>Extended language subtag records MUST include a
	'Preferred-Value'. The 'Preferred-Value' and 'Subtag' fields
	MUST be identical.</t><t>Although the ABNF production
	'extlang' permits up to three extended language tags in the
	language tag, extended language subtags MUST NOT include
	another extended language subtag in their 'Prefix'. That is, the
	second and third extended language subtag positions in a
	language tag are permanently reserved and tags that include
	those subtags in that position are, and will always remain,
	invalid.</t></list></t>

       <t>For example, the macrolanguage
	Chinese ('zh') encompasses a number of languages. For
	compatibility reasons, each of these languages has both a
	primary and extended language subtag in the registry. A few
	selected examples of these include Gan Chinese ('gan'),
	Cantonese Chinese ('yue'), and Mandarin Chinese ('cmn'). Each
	is encompassed by the macrolanguage 'zh' (Chinese). Therefore,
	they each have the prefix "zh" in their registry records. Thus,
	Gan Chinese is represented with tags beginning "zh-gan" or
	"gan", Cantonese with tags beginning either "yue" or "zh-yue",
	and Mandarin Chinese with "zh-cmn" or "cmn". The language
	subtag 'zh' can still be used without an extended language
	subtag to label a resource as some unspecified variety of
	Chinese, while the primary language subtag ('gan', 'yue',
	'cmn') is preferred to using the extended language form
	("zh-gan", "zh-yue", "zh-cmn").</t>

         <section anchor="region" title="Region Subtag">
	<t>Region subtags are used to indicate linguistic variations
	associated with or appropriate to a specific country,

	indicate variations such as regional dialects or usage, or
	region-specific spelling conventions. It can also be used to
	indicate that content is expressed in a way that is

		<t>Variant subtags MUST be registered with IANA according to the rules in

				</section>

		<section anchor="extensionsubt" title="Extension Subtags">

	<t>Extensions provide a mechanism for extending language tags
	for use in various applications. They are intended to identify
	information that is commonly used in association with
	languages or language tags but that is not part of language
	identification. See <xref target="extensions"/>. The following
	rules apply to extensions:</t>

					<t>
			<list style="numbers">
			<t>An extension MUST follow at least a primary language subtag. That is,
        a language tag cannot begin with an extension. Extensions extend language
        tags, they do not override or replace them. For example, "a-value" is not
        a well-formed language tag, while "de-a-value" is. Note that
        extensions cannot be used in tags that are entirely private
        use (that is, tags starting with "x-").</t>

			<t>Extension subtags are separated from the other subtags defined in 
        this document by a single-character subtag (called a "singleton"). The singleton 
        MUST be one allocated to a registration authority via the mechanism described 
        in <xref target="extensions"/> and MUST NOT be the letter 'x', which
        is reserved for private use subtag sequences.</t>
							
			<t>Each singleton subtag MUST appear at most one time in each tag (other than
        as a private use subtag). That is, singleton subtags MUST NOT be repeated. For example, the tag 
        "en-a-bbb-a-ccc" is invalid because the subtag 'a' appears
        twice. Note that the tag "en-a-bbb-x-a-ccc" is valid because
        the second appearance of the singleton 'a' is in a private use
        sequence.</t>

			<t>Extension subtags MUST meet whatever requirements are set by the 
        document that defines their singleton prefix and whatever requirements are
        provided by the maintaining authority. Note that there might
        not be a registry of these subtags and validating processors
        are not required to validate extensions.</t>

			<t>Each extension subtag MUST be from two to eight characters long 
        and consist solely of letters or digits, with each subtag separated by
        a single '-'. Case distinctions are ignored in extensions (as
        with any language subtag) and normalized subtags of this type
        are expected to be in lowercase.</t>

			<t>Each singleton MUST be followed by at least one extension subtag.
        For example, the tag "tlh-a-b-foo" is invalid because the first singleton
        'a' is followed immediately by another singleton 'b'.</t>

			<t>Extension subtags MUST follow all primary language, extended language, script,
        region, and variant subtags in a tag and MUST precede any
        private use subtag sequences.</t>

			<t>All subtags following the singleton and before another singleton
        are part of the extension. Example: In the tag "fr-a-Latn", the subtag
        'Latn' does not represent the script subtag 'Latn' defined
        in the IANA Language Subtag Registry. Its meaning is defined
        by the extension 'a'.</t>

			<t>In the event that more than one extension appears in a single tag, the
        tag SHOULD be canonicalized as described in
        <xref target="canonical"/>, by ordering the various extension
        sequences into case-insensitive ASCII order.</t>

						</list>
					</t>
			<t>For example, if an extension were defined
			for the singleton 'r' and it defined the
			subtags shown, then the following tag would be a valid example:
        "en-Latn-GB-boont-r-extended-sequence-x-private".</t>
				</section>

		<section anchor="privateusesubt" title="Private Use Subtags">

	<t>Private use subtags are used to indicate distinctions in
	language that are important in a given context by private agreement.
	The following rules apply to private use subtags:</t>

		<t><list style="numbers">
		<t>Private use subtags are separated from the other subtags 
        defined in this document by the reserved single-character
        subtag 'x'.</t>

		<t>Private use subtags MUST conform to the format and
		content constraints defined in the ABNF for all
		subtags; that is, they MUST consist solely of letters
		and digits and not exceed eight characters in
		length.</t>

		<t>Private use subtags MUST follow all primary
		language, extended language, script, region, variant,
		and extension subtags in the tag. Another 
        way of saying this is that all subtags following the singleton 'x' 
        MUST be considered private use. Example: The subtag 'US' in the 
        tag "en-x-US" is a private use subtag.</t>

		<t>A tag MAY consist entirely of private use subtags.</t>

		<t>No source is defined for private use subtags. Use of private use 
        subtags is by private agreement only.</t>

		<t>Private use subtags are NOT RECOMMENDED where
		alternatives exist or for general interchange. See
		<xref target="privateuse"/> for more information on
		private use subtag choice.</t>
						</list>
					</t>

	<t>For example, suppose a group of scholars is studying some
	texts in medieval Greek. They might agree to use some
	collection of private use subtags to identify different styles
	of writing in the texts. For example, they might use
	'el-x-koine' for documents in the "common" style while using
	'el-x-attic' for other documents that mimic the Attic
	style. These subtags would not be recognized by outside
	processes or systems, but might be useful in categorizing
	various texts for study by those in the
	group.</t>
 
        <t>In the registry, there are also subtags derived from codes reserved by ISO 639, ISO 15924, or ISO 3166 for private use. Do not confuse these with private use subtag sequences following the subtag 'x'. See <xref target="privateuse"></xref>.</t>

				</section>
	<section anchor="preexisreg" title="Grandfathered and Redundant Registrations">

	<t>Prior to RFC 4646, whole language tags were registered
	according to the rules in RFC 1766 and/or RFC 3066. All of
	these registered tags remain valid as language
	tags. </t>

       <t>Many of these registered tags were made redundant
	by the advent of either RFC 4646 or this document. A redundant
	tag is a grandfathered registration whose individual subtags
	appear with the same semantic meaning in the registry. For
	example, the tag "zh-Hant" (Traditional Chinese) can now be
	composed from the subtags 'zh' (Chinese) and 'Hant' (Han
	script traditional variant). These redundant tags are
	maintained in the registry as records of type 'redundant',
	mostly as a matter of historical curiosity.</t>

       <t>The remainder of the previously registered tags are
	"grandfathered". These tags are classified into two groups:
	'regular' and 'irregular'.</t>

        <t>Grandfathered tags that (appear to) match the 'langtag' production
	in <xref target="ABNF"></xref> are considered 'regular'
	grandfathered tags. These tags contain one or more subtags that either do
	not individually appear in the registry or
	appear but with a different semantic meaning: each tag, in its
	entirety, represents a language or collection of
	languages.</t>

        <t>Grandfathered tags that do not match the
	'langtag' production in the ABNF and would otherwise be
	invalid are considered 'irregular' grandfathered tags. With
	the exception of "en-GB-oed", which is a variant of "en-GB",
	each of them, in its entirety, represents a language.</t>
	
	<t>Many of the grandfathered tags have been superseded by the
	subsequent addition of new subtags: each superseded record
	contains a 'Preferred-Value' field that ought to be used to form
	language tags representing that value. For example, the tag
	"art-lojban" is superseded by the primary language subtag
	'jbo'.</t>
				</section>

	<section title="Classes of Conformance" anchor="conformance">

	<t>Implementations sometimes need to describe their
	capabilities with regard to the rules and practices described
	in this document. Tags can be checked or verified in a number
	of ways, but two particular classes of tag conformance are
	formally defined here.</t>

	<t>A tag is considered "well-formed" if it conforms to the
	 <xref target="syntax">ABNF</xref>. Language tags may be
	well-formed in terms of syntax but not valid in terms of
	content. However, many operations involving language tags work
	well without knowing anything about the meaning or validity of
	the subtags.</t>

	<t>A tag is considered "valid" if it satisfies these conditions:<list style="symbols">
	
		<t>The tag is well-formed.</t>
		<t>Either the tag is in the list of grandfathered tags
		or all of its primary language, extended language,
		script, region, and variant subtags appear in the IANA
		Language Subtag Registry as of the particular registry
		date.</t>

		<t>There are no duplicate variant subtags.</t>

               <t>There are no duplicate singleton (extension) subtags.</t>

						</list>
					</t>
	<t>Note that a tag's validity depends on the date of the
	registry used to validate the tag. A more recent copy of the
	registry might contain a subtag that an older version does
	not.</t>

	<t>A tag is considered valid for a
	given <xref target="extensions">extension</xref> (as of a
	particular version, revision, and date) if it meets the
	criteria for "valid" above and also satisfies this
	condition:<list>

	<t>Each subtag used in the extension part of the tag is valid according to the extension.</t>
						</list>
					</t>
					
	<t>Older specifications or language tag implementations
	sometimes reference <xref target="RFC3066"/>. A wider array of
	tags was considered well-formed under that document. Any
	tags that were valid for use under RFC 3066 are both
	well-formed and valid under this document's syntax; only
	invalid or illegal tags were well-formed under the earlier
	definition but no longer are. The language tag syntax under
	RFC 3066 was:</t>

	<figure anchor="rfc3066abnf" title="RFC 3066 Language Tag Syntax">
	<artwork name="rfc3066.abnf">
    obs-language-tag = primary-subtag *( "-" subtag )
    primary-subtag   = 1*8ALPHA
    subtag           = 1*8(ALPHA / DIGIT)</artwork>
					</figure>
	
	<t>Subtags designated for private use as well as private use
	sequences introduced by the 'x' subtag are available for cases
	in which no assigned subtags are available and registration is
	not a suitable option. For example, one might use a tag such
	as "no-QQ", where 'QQ' is one of a range of private use ISO
	3166-1 codes to indicate an otherwise undefined region. Users
	MUST NOT assign language tags that use subtags that do not
	appear in the registry other than in private use sequences
	(such as the subtag 'personal' in the tag
	"en-x-personal"). Besides not being valid, the user also
	risks collision with a future possible assignment or
	registrations.</t>

        <t>Note well: although the 'Language-Tag'
	production appearing in this document is functionally
	equivalent to the one in <xref target="RFC4646"></xref>, it
	has been changed to prevent certain errors in well-formedness
	arising from the old 'grandfathered' production.</t>

	language tags. This  allows implementers a straightforward and
	reliable way to validate language tags. The registry will be
	maintained so that, except for  extension subtags, it is
	possible to validate all of the subtags that appear in  a
	language tag under the provisions of this document or  its
	revisions or successors. In addition, the meaning of the
	various subtags  will be unambiguous and stable over
	time. (The meaning of private use subtags,  of course, is not
	defined by the registry.)</t>

	<t>This section defines the registry along with the
	maintenance and update procedures associated with it, as well
	as a registry for extensions to language tags
	(<xref target="extensions"/>).</t>

        <section anchor="ianaformat" title="Format of the IANA Language Subtag Registry">

	<t>The IANA Language Subtag Registry is a
   machine-readable file in the format described in this section, plus copies of the
   registration forms approved in accordance with
   the process described in <xref target="registrationProc"/>. </t>

	<t>The existing registration forms for grandfathered and
	redundant tags taken from RFC 3066 have been maintained as
	part of the obsolete RFC 3066 registry. The subtags added to
	the registry by either <xref target="RFC4645"/> or
	<xref target="RFC5645"/> do not have separate
	registration forms (so no forms are archived for these
	additions).</t>

	<section title="File Format" anchor="fileformat">
	
	<t>The registry is a  <xref target="Unicode"></xref> text file
	and consists of a series of records in a format based on
	"record-jar" (described in <xref target="record-jar"/>). Each
	record, in turn, consists of a series of fields that describe
	the various subtags and tags. The actual registry file is
	encoded using the <xref target="RFC3629">UTF-8</xref>
	character encoding.</t>

	<t> Each field can be considered a single, logical line of
	characters. Each field contains a "field-name" and a
	"field-body". These are separated by a "field-separator". The
	field-separator is a COLON character (U+003A) plus any
	surrounding whitespace.  Each field is terminated by the newline sequence CRLF. The
	text in each field MUST be in Unicode Normalization Form C
	(NFC).</t>

	<t>A collection of fields forms a "record". Records are
	separated by lines containing only the sequence "%%" (U+0025
	U+0025). </t>

	<t>Although fields are logically a single line of text, each
	  line of text in the file format is limited to 72 bytes in
	  length. To accommodate this, the field-body can be split
	  into a multiple-line representation; this is called
	  "folding". Folding is done according to customary
	  conventions for line-wrapping. This is typically on
	  whitespace boundaries, but can occur between other
	  characters when the value does not include spaces, such as
	  when a language does not use whitespace between words. In
	  any event, there MUST NOT be breaks inside a multibyte UTF-8
	  sequence or in the middle of a combining character
	  sequence. For more information, see
	  <xref target="UAX14"/>.</t>

	<t>Although the file format uses the Unicode character set and
	the file itself is encoded using the UTF-8 encoding, fields are
	restricted to the printable characters from
	the <xref target="ISO646">US-ASCII</xref> repertoire unless
	otherwise indicated in the description of a
	specific <xref target="recordformat">field</xref>.</t>

	<t>The format of the registry is described by the
	following <xref target="RFC5234">ABNF</xref>. Character
	numbers (code points) are taken from Unicode, and terminals in
	the ABNF productions are in terms of characters rather than
	bytes.</t>

	<t>The sequence '..' (U+002E U+002E) in a field-body denotes a
	range of values. Such a range represents all  subtags of the
	same length that are in alphabetic or numeric order within
	that range,  including the values explicitly mentioned. For
	example, 'a..c' denotes the values 'a', 'b', and 'c', and
	'11..13' denotes the values '11', '12', and '13'.</t>

	<t>All fields whose field-body contains a date value use the
	"full-date" format specified in <xref target="RFC3339"/>. For
	example, "2004-06-28" represents June 28, 2004, in the
	Gregorian calendar.</t>

	<section anchor="recordformat" title="Record and Field Definitions">
	
	<t>There are three types of records in the registry: "File-Date", "Subtag", and "Tag".</t>

	<t>The first record in the registry is always the "File-Date" record.
This record occurs only once in the file and contains a single field
whose field-name is "File-Date". The field-body of this record
contains a date (see <xref target="iana-subtag-reg"></xref>), making it possible to easily recognize
different versions of the registry.</t>

	<t>Subsequent records contain multiple fields and represent
	information about either subtags or tags. Both types of records
	have an identical structure, except that "Subtag" records contain
	a field with a field-name of "Subtag", while, unsurprisingly,
	"Tag" records contain a field with a field-name of
	"Tag". Field-names MUST NOT occur more than once per record,
	with the exception of the 'Description', 'Comments', and
	'Prefix' fields. </t>

        <t>Each record MUST contain at least one of each of the following
	fields:<list style="symbols">

	<t>'Type'<list>
	<t>Type's field-body MUST consist of one of the following strings: "language",
   "extlang", "script", "region", "variant", "grandfathered", and
   "redundant"; it denotes the type of tag or subtag.</t>

	"variant".</t>

	<t>Tag's field-body contains a complete language tag. This
	field MUST appear in all records whose 'Type' has one of these
	values: "grandfathered" or "redundant". If the 'Type' is
	"grandfathered", then the 'Tag' field-body will be one of the
	tags listed in either the 'regular' or 'irregular' production
	found in <xref target="syntax"></xref>.</t>

	<t>Each record MAY also contain the following fields:<list style="symbols">

	<t>'Deprecated'<list>
	<t>Deprecated's field-body contains the date the record was

	the 'Added' field in the same record. That is, the date of
	deprecation preceded the addition of the record to the
	registry.</t>

								</list>
	</t><t>'Preferred-Value'<list>
        <t>Preferred-Value's field-body contains a canonical mapping
        from this record's value to a modern equivalent that is
        preferred in its place. Depending on the value of the 'Type'
        field, this value can take different forms:<list>

	<t>For fields of type 'language', 'Preferred-Value' contains
	the primary language subtag that is preferred when forming the

       <t>For fields of type 'script', 'region', or
	'variant', 'Preferred-Value' contains the subtag of the same
	type that is preferred for forming the language tag.</t>

	<t>For fields of type 'extlang', 'grandfathered', or
	'redundant', 'Preferred-Value' contains an "extended language
	range" <xref target="RFC4647"></xref> that is preferred for
	forming the language tag. That is, the preferred language tag
	will contain, in order, each of the subtags that appears in
	the 'Preferred-Value'; additional fields can be included in a
	language tag, as described elsewhere in this document. For
	example, the replacement for the grandfathered tag
	"zh-min-nan" (Min Nan Chinese) is "nan", which can be used as
	the basis for tags such as "nan-Hant" or "nan-TW" (note that
	the extended language subtag form such as "zh-nan-Hant" or
	"zh-nan-TW" can also be used).</t>

								</list></t></list>
							</t>
							
	<t>'Prefix'<list>
	<t>Prefix's field-body contains a valid language tag that is RECOMMENDED as one possible prefix to this record's subtag. This field MAY appear in records whose 'Type' field-body is either 'extlang' or 'variant' (it MUST NOT appear in any other record type).</t>
								</list>
							</t>
							
	<t>'Suppress-Script'<list>
	<t>Suppress-Script's field-body contains a script subtag that
	SHOULD NOT be used to form language tags with the associated
	primary or extended language subtag. This field MUST appear
	only in records whose 'Type' field-body is 'language' or
	'extlang'. See <xref target="choice"/>.</t>

								</list>

	<t>'Macrolanguage'<list>
	<t>Macrolanguage's field-body contains a primary language
	subtag defined by ISO 639 as the "macrolanguage" that
	encompasses this language subtag. This field MUST appear only
	in records whose 'Type' field-body is either 'language' or
	'extlang'.</t>

								</list>
	</t><t>'Scope'<list>
        <t>Scope's field-body contains information about a primary or
        extended language subtag indicating the type of language code
        according to ISO 639. The values permitted in this field are
        "macrolanguage", "collection", "special", and
        "private-use". This field only appears in records whose 'Type'
        field-body is either 'language' or 'extlang'. When this field
        is omitted, the language is an individual language.</t></list></t>

	<t>'Comments'<list>
	<t>Comments's field-body contains additional information about the subtag, as
   deemed appropriate for understanding the registry and implementing language 
   tags using the subtag or tag.</t>

	<t>The 'Tag' field-body MUST be formatted according to the
	rules described in <xref target="casing"></xref>.</t>

				</section>

	<section anchor="descriptionfield" title="Description Field">

	<t>The field 'Description' contains a description of the tag
	or subtag in the record. The 'Description' field MAY appear
	more than once per record. The 'Description' field MAY include
	the full range of Unicode characters. At least one of the
	'Description' fields MUST be written or transcribed into the
	Latin script; additional 'Description' fields MAY be in any
	script or language.</t>

	<t>The 'Description' field is used for identification
	  purposes. Descriptions SHOULD contain all and only that
	  information necessary to distinguish one subtag from others
	  with which it might be confused.
They are not intended to provide general background information or
	  to provide all possible alternate names or
	  designations. 'Description' fields don't necessarily
	  represent the actual native name of the item in the record,
	  nor are any of the descriptions guaranteed to be in any
	  particular language (such as English or French, for
	  example).</t>

	<t>Descriptions in the registry that correspond to ISO 639,
	  ISO 15924,  ISO 3166-1, or UN M.49 codes are intended only
	  to indicate the meaning of that identifier as defined in the
	  source standard at the time it was added to the registry or
	  as subsequently modified, within the bounds of
	  the <xref target="ianastability">stability rules</xref>, via
	  subsequent registration. The 'Description' does not replace
	  the content of the source standard itself. 'Description'
	  fields are not intended to be the localized English names
	  for the subtags. Localization or translation of language tag
	  and subtag descriptions is out of scope of this
	  document.</t>

<t>For subtags taken from a source standard (such as ISO 639 or ISO
  15924), the 'Description' fields in the record are also initially
  taken from that source standard. Multiple descriptions in the source
  standard are split into separate 'Description' fields. The source
  standard's descriptions MAY be edited or modified, either prior to
  insertion or via the registration process, and additional or
  extraneous descriptions omitted or removed. Each 'Description' field
  MUST be unique within the record in which it appears, and formatting
  variations of the same description SHOULD NOT occur in that specific
  record. For example, while the ISO 639-1 code 'fy' has both the
  description "Western Frisian" and the description "Frisian, Western"
  in that standard, only one of these descriptions appears in the
  registry.</t>

<t>To help ensure that users do not become confused
  about which subtag to use, 'Description' fields assigned to a record
  of any specific type ('language', 'extlang', 'script', and so on)
  MUST be unique within that given record type with the following
  exception: if a particular 'Description' field occurs in multiple
  records of a given type, then at most one of the records can omit
  the 'Deprecated' field. All deprecated records that share a
  'Description' MUST have the same 'Preferred-Value', and all
  non-deprecated records MUST be that 'Preferred-Value'. This means
  that two records of the same type that share a 'Description' are
  also semantically equivalent and no more than one record with a
  given 'Description' is preferred for that meaning.</t>

<t>For example, consider the 'language' subtags 'zza' (Zaza) and 'diq'
  (Dimli). It so happens that 'zza' is a macrolanguage enclosing 'diq'
  and thus also has a description in ISO 639-3 of "Dimli". This
  description was edited to read "Dimli (macrolanguage)" in the
  registry record for 'zza' to prevent a collision.</t>

<t>By contrast, the subtags 'he' and 'iw' share a 'Description' value of "Hebrew";
  this is permitted because 'iw' is deprecated and its
  'Preferred-Value' is 'he'.</t>

<t>For fields of type 'language', the first 'Description' field appearing in the registry corresponds
  whenever possible to the Reference Name assigned by ISO 639-3. This
  helps facilitate cross-referencing between ISO 639 and the registry. </t>

<t>When creating or updating a record due to the action of one of the
  source standards, the Language Subtag Reviewer MAY edit descriptions
  to correct irregularities in formatting (such as misspellings,
  inappropriate apostrophes or other punctuation, or excessive or
  missing spaces) prior to submitting the proposed record to the
  ietf-languages@iana.org list for consideration.</t>

					
					
				</section>
	<section anchor="deprecatedfield" title="Deprecated Field">

	<t>The field 'Deprecated' contains the date the record was
	deprecated and MAY be added, changed, or removed from any
	record via the maintenance process described in
	<xref target="maintreg"/> or via the registration process
	described in <xref target="registrationProc"/>. Usually, the
	addition of a 'Deprecated' field is due to the action of one
	of the standards bodies, such as ISO 3166, withdrawing a
	code. Although valid in language tags, subtags and tags with a
	'Deprecated' field are deprecated, and validating processors
	SHOULD NOT generate these subtags. Note that a record that
	contains a 'Deprecated' field and no corresponding
	'Preferred-Value' field has no replacement mapping.</t>

       <t>In some historical cases, it might not have been possible to
	reconstruct the original deprecation date. For these cases, an
	approximate date appears in the registry. Some subtags and
	some grandfathered or redundant tags were deprecated before
	the initial creation of the registry. The exact rules for this
	appear in Section 2 of <xref target="RFC4645"></xref>. Note
	that these records have a 'Deprecated' field with an earlier
	date then the corresponding 'Added' field!</t>

				</section>
	<section anchor="preferredfield" title="Preferred-Value Field">
	
	<t>The field 'Preferred-Value' contains a mapping between the
	record in which it appears and another tag or subtag
	(depending on the record's 'Type'). The value in this field is
	used for canonicalization (see <xref target="canonical"></xref>). In cases where the
	subtag or tag also has a 'Deprecated' field, then the
	'Preferred-Value' is RECOMMENDED as the best choice to
	represent the value of this record when selecting a language
	tag. </t>

       <t>Records containing a 'Preferred-Value' fall into one
	of these four groups:<list style="numbers">

	<t>ISO 639 language codes that were later withdrawn in favor
	of other codes. These values are mostly a historical
	curiosity. The 'he'/'iw' pairing above is an example of
	this.</t>

	<t>Subtags (with types other than language or extlang) taken
	from codes or values that have been withdrawn in favor of a
	new code. In particular, this applies to region subtags taken
	from ISO 3166-1, because sometimes a country will change its
	name or administration in such a way that warrants a new
	region code. In some cases, countries have reverted to an
	older name, which might already be encoded. For example, the
	subtag 'ZR' (Zaire) was replaced by the subtag 'CD'
	(Democratic Republic of the Congo) when that country's name
	was changed.</t>

	<t>Tags or subtags that have become obsolete because the
	values they represent were later encoded. Many of the
	grandfathered or redundant tags were later encoded by ISO 639,
	for example, and fall into this grouping. For example,
	"i-klingon" was deprecated when the subtag 'tlh' was
	added. The record for "i-klingon" has a 'Preferred-Value' of
	'tlh'.</t>

        <t>Extended language subtags always have a mapping
	to their identical primary language subtag. For example, the
	extended language subtag 'yue' (Cantonese) can be used to form
	the tag "zh-yue". It has a 'Preferred-Value' mapping to the
	primary language subtag 'yue', meaning that a tag such as
	"zh-yue-Hant-HK" can be canonicalized to "yue-Hant-HK".</t>

						</list>
					</t>
	<t>Records other than those of type 'extlang' that contain a
	'Preferred-Value' field MUST also have a 'Deprecated'
	field. This field contains the date on which the tag or subtag
	was deprecated in favor of the preferred value.</t>

        <t>For records of type 'extlang', the 'Preferred-Value' field appears
	without a corresponding 'Deprecated' field. An implementation
	MAY ignore these preferred value mappings, although if it
	ignores the mapping, it SHOULD do so consistently. It SHOULD
	also treat the 'Preferred-Value' as equivalent to the mapped
	item. For example, the tags "zh-yue-Hant-HK" and "yue-Hant-HK"
	are semantically equivalent and ought to be treated as if they
	were the same tag.</t>
 
        <t>Occasionally, the deprecated code is preferred in certain
        contexts. For example, both "iw" and "he" can be used in
        the Java programming language, but "he" is converted on
        input to "iw", which is thus the canonical form	in Java. </t>

	<t>'Preferred-Value' mappings in records of type 'region'
	sometimes do not represent exactly the same meaning as the
	original value. There are many reasons for a country code to
	be changed, and the effect this has on the formation of
	language tags will depend on the nature of the change in
	question. For example, the region subtag 'YD' (Democratic
	Yemen) was deprecated in favor of the subtag 'YE' (Yemen) when
	those two countries unified in 1990.</t>

	<t>A 'Preferred-Value' MAY be added to, changed, or removed
	from records according to the rules in
	<xref target="maintreg"/>. Addition, modification, or removal
	of a 'Preferred-Value' field in a record does not imply that
	content using the affected subtag needs to be retagged.</t>

	<t>The 'Preferred-Value' fields in records of type
	  "grandfathered" and "redundant" each contain an "extended
	  language range" <xref target="RFC4647"></xref> that is
	  strongly RECOMMENDED for use in place of the record's
	  value. In many cases, these mappings were created via
	  deprecation of the tags during the period before
	  <xref target="RFC4646"/> was adopted. For example, the tag
	  "no-nyn" was deprecated in favor of the ISO 639-1-defined
	  language code 'nn'. </t>

          <t>The 'Preferred-Value' field in
	  subtag records of type "extlang" also contains an "extended
	  language range". This allows the subtag to be deprecated in
	  favor of either a single primary language subtag or a new
	  language-extlang sequence.</t>

          <t>Usually, the addition, removal, or change of a 'Preferred-Value' field for a subtag
	  is done to reflect changes in one of the source
	  standards. For example, if an ISO 3166-1 region code is
	  deprecated in favor of another code, that SHOULD result in
	  the addition of a 'Preferred-Value' field.</t>

         <t>Changes to one subtag can affect other subtags as well: when
  proposing changes to the registry, the Language Subtag Reviewer MUST
  review the registry for such effects and propose the necessary
  changes using the process
  in <xref target="registrationProc"></xref>, although anyone MAY
  request such changes. For example:<list>

	<t>Suppose that subtag 'XX' has a 'Preferred-Value' of 'YY'. If 'YY' later changes to
have a 'Preferred-Value' of 'ZZ', then the 'Preferred-Value' for 'XX' MUST also change
to be 'ZZ'.</t>

	<t>Suppose that a registered language subtag 'dialect' represents a language not
yet available in any part of ISO 639. The later addition of a corresponding language
code in ISO 639 SHOULD result in the addition of a 'Preferred-Value' for
'dialect'.</t>
						</list>
					</t>
				</section>
	<section anchor="prefixfield" title="Prefix Field">

	<t>The field 'Prefix' contains a valid language tag that is
	RECOMMENDED as one possible prefix to this record's subtag,
	perhaps with other subtags. That is, when including an
	extended language or a variant subtag that has at least one
	'Prefix' in a language tag, the resulting tag SHOULD match at
	least one of the subtag's 'Prefix' fields using the "Extended
	Filtering" algorithm (see <xref target="RFC4647"></xref>), and
	each of the subtags in that 'Prefix' SHOULD appear before the
	subtag itself. </t>

        <t>The 'Prefix' field MUST appear exactly
	once in a record of type 'extlang'. The 'Prefix' field MAY
	appear multiple times (or not at all) in records of type
	'variant'. Additional fields of this type MAY be added to a
	'variant' record via the registration process, provided the
	'variant' record already has at least one 'Prefix' field. </t>

       <t>Each 'Prefix' field indicates  a particular sequence of
       subtags that form a meaningful tag with this subtag. For
       example, the extended language subtag 'cmn' (Mandarin Chinese)
       only makes sense with its prefix 'zh' (Chinese). Similarly,
       'rozaj' (Resian, a dialect of Slovenian) would be appropriate
       when used with its prefix 'sl' (Slovenian), while tags such as
       "is-1994" are not appropriate (and probably not
       meaningful). Although the 'Prefix' for 'rozaj' is "sl", other
       subtags might appear between them. For example, the tag
       "sl-IT-rozaj" (Slovenian, Italy, Resian) matches the 'Prefix'
       "sl".</t>

       <t>The 'Prefix' also indicates when variant subtags
       make sense when used together (many that otherwise share a
       'Prefix' are mutually exclusive) and what the relative ordering
       of variants is supposed to be. For example, the variant '1994'
       (Standardized Resian orthography) has several 'Prefix' fields
       in the registry ("sl-rozaj", "sl-rozaj-biske",
       "sl-rozaj-njiva", "sl-rozaj-osojs", and "sl-rozaj-solba"). This
       indicates not only that '1994' is appropriate to use with each
       of these five Resian variant subtags ('rozaj', 'biske',
       'njiva', 'osojs', and 'solba'), but also that it SHOULD appear
       following any of these variants in a tag. Thus, the language
       tag ought to take the form "sl-rozaj-biske-1994", rather than
       "sl-1994-rozaj-biske" or "sl-rozaj-1994-biske".</t>

	<t>If a record includes no 'Prefix' field, a 'Prefix' field
	MUST NOT be added to the record at a later date. Otherwise,
	changes (additions, deletions, or modifications) to the set of
	'Prefix' fields MAY be registered, as long as they strictly
	widen the range of language tags that are recommended. For
	example, a 'Prefix' with the value "be-Latn" (Belarusian, Latin script) could
	be replaced by the value "be" (Belarusian) but not by the
	value "ru-Latn" (Russian, Latin script) or the value
	"be-Latn-BY" (Belarusian, Latin script, Belarus), since these
	latter either change or narrow the range of suggested
	tags.</t>
					
	<t>The field-body of the 'Prefix' field MUST NOT conflict with
	any 'Prefix' already registered for a given record. Such a
	conflict would occur when no valid tag could be constructed
	that would contain the prefix, such as when two subtags each
	have a 'Prefix' that contains the other subtag. For example,
	suppose that the subtag 'avariant' has the prefix
	"es-bvariant". Then the subtag 'bvariant' cannot be assigned the
	prefix 'avariant', for that would require a tag of the form
	"es-avariant-bvariant-avariant", which would not be valid.</t>

				</section>

	<section anchor="suppressfield" title="Suppress-Script Field">

	<t>The field 'Suppress-Script' contains a script subtag (whose
	record appears in the registry). The field 'Suppress-Script'
	MUST appear only in records whose 'Type' field-body is either
	'language' or 'extlang'. This field MUST NOT appear more than
	one time in a record. </t>

        <t>This field indicates a script
	used to write the overwhelming majority of documents for the
	given language. The subtag for such a script therefore adds no
	distinguishing information to a language tag and thus SHOULD
	NOT be used for most documents in that language. Omitting the
	script subtag indicated by this field helps ensure greater
	compatibility between the language tags generated according to
	the rules in this document and language tags and tag
	processors or consumers based on RFC 3066. For example,
	virtually all Icelandic documents are written in the Latin
	script, making the subtag 'Latn' redundant in the tag
	"is-Latn".</t>

	<t>Many language subtag records do not have a 'Suppress-Script' field. The
lack of a 'Suppress-Script' might indicate that the language is
customarily written in more than one script or that the language is not
customarily written at all. It might also mean that sufficient
information was not available when the record was created and thus
	  remains a candidate for future registration.</t>

				</section>
	<section title="Macrolanguage Field" anchor="macrolang">

	<t>The field 'Macrolanguage' contains a primary language
	subtag (whose record appears in the registry). This field
	indicates a language that encompasses this subtag's language
	according to assignments made by ISO 639-3.</t>

	<t> ISO 639-3 labels some languages in the registry as
	"macrolanguages". ISO 639-3 defines the term "macrolanguage"
	to mean "clusters of closely-related language varieties that
	[...] can be considered distinct individual languages, yet in
	certain usage contexts a single language identity for all is
	needed".  These correspond to codes registered in ISO 639-2 as
	individual languages that were found to correspond to more
	than one language in ISO 639-3. </t>

       <t>A language contained
	within a macrolanguage is called an "encompassed
	language". The record for each encompassed language contains a
	'Macrolanguage' field in the registry; the macrolanguages
	themselves are not specially marked. Note that some
	encompassed languages have ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-2 codes.</t>

	<t>The 'Macrolanguage' field can only occur in records of type
	'language' or 'extlang'. Only values assigned by ISO 639-3
	will be considered for inclusion. 'Macrolanguage' fields MAY be
	added or removed via the normal registration process whenever
	ISO 639-3 defines new values or withdraws old
	values. Macrolanguages are informational, and MAY be removed
	or changed if ISO 639-3 changes the values. For more
	information on the use of this field and choosing between
	macrolanguage and encompassed language subtags,
	see <xref target="macrolanguages"></xref>.</t>

	<t>For example, the language subtags 'nb' (Norwegian Bokmal)
	and 'nn' (Norwegian Nynorsk) each have a 'Macrolanguage' field with a value
	of 'no' (Norwegian). For more information, see
	<xref target="choice"/>.</t>

	</section>

       <section title="Scope Field" anchor="scope">

       <t>The field 'Scope' contains classification information about
       a primary or extended language subtag derived from ISO
       639. Most languages have a scope of 'individual', which means
       that the language is not a macrolanguage, collection, special
       code, or private use. That is, it is what one would normally
       consider to be 'a language'. Any primary or extended language
       subtag that has no 'Scope' field is an individual
       language. </t>

        <t>'Scope' information can sometimes be helpful in
       selecting language tags, since it indicates the purpose or
       "scope" of the code assignment within ISO 639. The available
       values are:

        <list style="symbols">
        <t>'macrolanguage' - Indicates a macrolanguage as defined by ISO 639-3
       (see <xref target="macrolang"></xref>). A macrolanguage is
       a cluster of closely related languages that are sometimes
       considered to be a single language.</t>

       <t>'collection' - Indicates a subtag that represents a collection of languages,
       typically related by some type of historical, geographical, or
       linguistic association. Unlike a macrolanguage, a collection
       can contain languages that are only loosely related and a
       collection cannot be used interchangeably with languages that
       belong to it.</t>

       <t>'special' - Indicates a special language
       code. These are subtags used for identifying linguistic
       attributes not particularly associated with a concrete
       language. These include codes for when the language is
       undetermined or for non-linguistic content.</t>

      <t>'private-use' - Indicates a code reserved for private use in the underlying
       standard. Subtags with this scope can be used to indicate a
       primary language for which no ISO 639 or registered assignment
       exists.</t></list></t>

      <t>The 'Scope' field MAY appear in records
       of type 'language' or 'extlang'. Note that many of the prefixes
       for extended language subtags will have a 'Scope' of
       'macrolanguage' (although some will not) and that many
       languages that have a 'Scope' of 'macrolanguage' will have
       extended language subtags associated with them.</t>

      <t>The 'Scope' field MAY be added, modified, or removed via the registration
       process, provided the change mirrors changes made by ISO 639 to the
       assignment's classification. Such a change is expected to be
       rare.</t>

       <t>For example, the primary language subtag 'zh'
       (Chinese) has a 'Scope' of 'macrolanguage', while its enclosed
       language 'nan' (Min Nan Chinese) has a 'Scope' of
       'individual'. The special value 'und' (Undetermined) has a
       'Scope' of 'special'. The ISO 639-5 collection 'gem' (Germanic
       languages) has a 'Scope' of 'collection'.</t></section>

	<section anchor="commentsfield" title="Comments Field">
	
	<t>The field 'Comments' contains additional information about
	the record and MAY appear more than once per record. The
	field-body MAY include the full range of Unicode characters
	and is not restricted to any particular script. This field MAY
	be inserted or changed via the registration process, and no
	guarantee of stability is provided.</t>

	<t>The content of this field is not restricted, except by the
	need to register the information, the suitability of the
	request, and by reasonable practical size limitations. The
	primary reason for the 'Comments' field is subtag
	identification -- to help distinguish the subtag from others
	with which it might be confused as an aid to usage. Large
	amounts of information about the use, history, or general
	background of a subtag are frowned upon, as these generally
	belong in a registration request rather than in the
	registry.</t>

	<section anchor="subtagreviewer" title="Language Subtag Reviewer">

	<t>The Language Subtag Reviewer moderates the
	ietf-languages@iana.org mailing list, responds to requests for

	duties described in <xref target="maintreg"/>. Only the
	Language Subtag Reviewer is permitted to request IANA to
	change, update, or add records to the Language Subtag
	Registry. The Language Subtag Reviewer MAY delegate list
	moderation and other clerical duties as needed. </t>

	<t>The Language Subtag Reviewer is appointed by the IESG for
	an indefinite term, subject to removal or replacement at the
	IESG's discretion. The IESG will solicit nominees for the
	position (upon adoption of this document or upon a vacancy)
	and then solicit feedback on the nominees'
	qualifications. Qualified candidates should be familiar with
	BCP 47 and its requirements; be willing to fairly,

	process; and be suitably informed about the issues of language
	identification so that the reviewer can assess the claims and
	draw upon the contributions of language experts and subtag
	requesters.</t>

	<t>The subsequent performance or decisions of the Language

	<section title="Maintenance of the Registry" anchor="maintreg">

	<t>Maintenance of the registry requires that, as codes are assigned or withdrawn by
ISO 639, ISO 15924, ISO 3166, and UN M.49, the Language Subtag Reviewer MUST evaluate each
change and determine the appropriate course of action according to the
	  rules in this document. Such updates follow the registration
	  process described in
	  <xref target="registrationProc"/>. Usually, the Language
	  Subtag Reviewer will start the process for the new or
	  updated record by filling in the registration form and
	  submitting it. If a change to one of these standards takes
	  place and the Language Subtag Reviewer does not do this in a
	  timely manner, then any interested party MAY submit the
	  form. Thereafter, the registration process continues
	  normally. </t>

          <t>Note that some registrations affect other
	  subtags--perhaps more than one--as when a region subtag is
	  being deprecated in favor of a new value. The Language
	  Subtag Reviewer is responsible for ensuring that any such
	  changes are properly registered, with each change requiring
	  its own registration form.</t>

	<t>The Language Subtag Reviewer MUST ensure that new subtags
	  meet the requirements elsewhere in this document (and most especially in
	  <xref target="ianastability"/>) or submit an appropriate
	  registration form for an alternate subtag as described in
	  that section. Each individual subtag affected by a change
	  MUST be sent to the ietf-languages@iana.org list with its own
	  registration form and in a separate message.</t>

			</section>
	<section anchor="ianastability" title="Stability of IANA Registry Entries">
	
	<t>The stability of entries and their meaning in the registry
	is critical to the long-term stability of language tags. The
	rules in this section guarantee that a specific language tag's
	meaning is stable over time and will not change. </t>

	<t>These rules specifically deal with how changes to codes
	(including withdrawal and deprecation of codes) maintained by
	ISO 639, ISO 15924, ISO 3166, and UN M.49 are reflected in the
	IANA Language Subtag Registry. Assignments to the IANA
	Language Subtag Registry MUST follow the following stability
	rules:  

   <list style="numbers">
	<t>Values in the fields 'Type', 'Subtag', 'Tag', and 'Added'
	  MUST NOT be changed and are guaranteed to be stable over
	  time.</t>

         <t>Values in the fields 'Preferred-Value' and 'Deprecated' MAY be
	  added, altered, or removed via the registration
	  process. These changes SHOULD be limited to changes
	  necessary to mirror changes in one of the underlying
	  standards (ISO 639, ISO 15924, ISO 3166-1, or UN M.49) and
	  typically alteration or removal of a 'Preferred-Value' is
	  limited specifically to region codes.</t>

	<t>Values in the 'Description' field MUST NOT be changed in a
	way that would invalidate any existing tags. The description
	MAY be broadened somewhat in scope, changed to add
	information, or adapted to the most common modern usage. For
	example, countries occasionally change their names; a
	historical example of this is "Upper Volta" changing to
	"Burkina Faso".</t>

	<t>Values in the field 'Prefix' MAY be added to existing
	records of type 'variant' via the registration process,
	provided the 'variant' already has at least one 'Prefix'. A
	'Prefix' field SHALL NOT be registered for any 'variant' that
	has no existing 'Prefix' field. If a prefix is added to a
	variant record, 'Comment' fields MAY be used to explain
	different usages with the various prefixes.</t>

	<t>Values in the field 'Prefix' in records of type 'variant'
	MAY also be modified, so long as the modifications broaden the
	set of prefixes. That is, a prefix MAY be replaced by one of
	its own prefixes. For example, the prefix "en-US" could be
	replaced by "en", but not by the prefixes "en-Latn", "fr", or
	"en-US-boont". If one of those prefix values were needed, it
	would have to be separately registered.</t>

        <t>Values in the field 'Prefix' in records of type 'extlang' MUST NOT be added,
	modified, or removed.</t>
						
	<t>The field 'Prefix' MUST NOT be removed from any record in
	which it appears. This field SHOULD be included in the initial
	registration of any records of type 'variant' and MUST be
	included in any records of type 'extlang'.</t>

        <t>The field 'Comments' MAY be added, changed, modified, or removed via the
	registration process or any of the processes or considerations
	described in this section.</t>

	<t>The field 'Suppress-Script' MAY be added or removed via the
	registration process.</t>

	<t>The field 'Macrolanguage' MAY be added or removed via the
	registration process, but only in response to changes made by
	ISO 639. The 'Macrolanguage' field appears whenever a language
	has a corresponding macrolanguage in ISO 639. That is, the
	'Macrolanguage' fields in the registry exactly match those of
	ISO 639. No other macrolanguage mappings will be considered
	for registration.</t>

        <t>The field 'Scope' MAY be added or removed from a primary or
        extended language subtag after
	initial registration, and it MAY be modified in order to match
	any changes made by ISO 639. Changes to the 'Scope' field MUST
	mirror changes made by ISO 639. Note that primary or extended
	language subtags whose records do not contain a 'Scope' field
	(that is, most of them) are individual languages as described
	in <xref target="scope"></xref>.</t>

	<t>Primary and extended language subtags (other than
	independently registered values created using the registration
	process) are created according to the assignments of the
	various parts of ISO 639, as
	follows: <list style="letters">

        <t>Codes assigned by ISO 639-1
	that do not conflict with existing two-letter primary language
	subtags and that have no corresponding three-letter primary
	defined in the registry are entered into the IANA registry as
	new records of type 'language'. Note that languages given an
	ISO 639-1 code cannot be given extended language subtags, even
	if encompassed by a macrolanguage.</t>

        <t>Codes assigned by ISO
	639-3 or ISO 639-5 that do not conflict with existing
	three-letter primary language subtags and that do not have
	ISO 639-1 codes assigned (or expected to be assigned) are
	entered into the IANA registry as new records of type
	'language'. Note that these two standards now comprise a
	superset of ISO 639-2 codes. Codes that have a defined
	'macrolanguage' mapping at the time of their registration MUST
	contain a 'Macrolanguage' field. </t>

        <t>Codes assigned by ISO
	639-3 MAY also be considered for an extended language subtag
	registration. Note that they MUST be assigned a primary
	language subtag record of type 'language' even when an
	'extlang' record is proposed. When considering extended
	language subtag assignment, these criteria
	apply:<list style="numbers">

        <t>If a language has a
	macrolanguage mapping, and that macrolanguage has other
	encompassed languages that are assigned extended language
	subtags, then the new language SHOULD have an 'extlang' record
	assigned to it as well. For example, any language with a
	macrolanguage of 'zh' or 'ar' would be assigned an 'extlang'
	record.</t>

        <t>'Extlang' records SHOULD NOT be created for
	languages if other languages encompassed by the macrolanguage
	do not also include 'extlang' records. For example, if a new
	Serbo-Croatian ('sh') language were registered, it would not
	get an extlang record because other languages encompassed, such
	as Serbian ('sr'), do not include one in the
	registry.</t>

        <t>Sign languages SHOULD have an 'extlang' record
	with a 'Prefix' of 'sgn'.</t>

        <t>'Extlang' records MUST NOT be
	created for items already in the registry. Extended language
	subtags will only be considered at the time of initial
	registration.</t>

        <t>Extended language subtag records MUST
	include the fields 'Prefix' and 'Preferred-Value' with
	field values assigned as described
	in <xref target="extlang"></xref>.</t></list>  </t>

        <t>Any other codes assigned by ISO 639-2 that do not conflict with
	existing three-letter primary or extended language subtags and
	that do not have ISO 639-1 two-letter codes assigned are
	entered into the IANA registry as new records of type
	'language'. This type of registration is not supposed to occur
	in the future.</t></list></t>

						
						
	<t>Codes assigned by ISO 15924 and ISO 3166-1 that do not
	conflict with existing subtags of the associated type and
	whose meaning is not the same as an existing subtag of the
	same type are entered into the IANA registry as new
	records.</t>

	<t>Codes assigned by ISO 639, ISO 15924, or ISO 3166-1 that
	are withdrawn by their respective maintenance or registration
	authority remain valid in language tags. A 'Deprecated' field
	containing the date of withdrawal MUST be added to the
	record. If a new record of the same type is added that
	represents a replacement value, then a 'Preferred-Value' field
	MAY also be added. The registration process MAY be used to add
	comments about the withdrawal of the code by the respective
	standard.<list style="hanging">

		<t>For example: the region code 'TL' was assigned to
		the country 'Timor-Leste', replacing the code 'TP'
		(which was assigned to 'East Timor' when it was under
		administration by Portugal). The subtag 'TP' remains
		valid in language tags, but its record contains the
		'Preferred-Value' of 'TL' and its field 'Deprecated'
		contains the date the new code was assigned
		('2004-07-06').</t>

							</list>
						</t>
	<t>Codes assigned by ISO 639, ISO 15924, or ISO 3166-1 that
	conflict with existing subtags of the associated type,
	including subtags that are deprecated, MUST NOT be entered
	into the registry. The following additional considerations
	apply to subtag values that are reassigned:

<list style="letters">
	<t>For ISO 639 codes, if the newly assigned code's meaning is
	not represented by a subtag in the IANA registry, the Language
	Subtag Reviewer, as described in
	<xref target="registrationProc"/>, SHALL prepare a proposal
	for entering in the IANA registry, as soon as practical, a
	registered language subtag as an alternate value for the new
	code. The form of the registered language subtag will be at
	the discretion of the Language Subtag Reviewer and MUST
	conform to other restrictions on language subtags in this
	document.</t>

	<t>For all subtags whose meaning is derived from an external
	  standard (that is, by ISO 639, ISO 15924, ISO 3166-1, or UN
	  M.49), if a new meaning is assigned to an existing code and
	  the new meaning broadens the meaning of that code, then the
	  meaning for the associated subtag MAY be changed to
	  match. The meaning of a subtag MUST NOT be narrowed,
	  however, as this can result in an unknown proportion of the
	  existing uses of a subtag becoming invalid. Note: the ISO 639
	  registration authority (RA) has adopted a similar stability
	  policy.</t>

	<t>For ISO 15924 codes, if the newly assigned code's meaning
	is not represented by a subtag in the IANA registry, the
	Language Subtag Reviewer, as described in
	<xref target="registrationProc"/>, SHALL prepare a proposal
	for entering in the IANA registry, as soon as practical, a
	registered variant subtag as an alternate value for the new
	code. The form of the registered variant subtag will be at the
	discretion of the Language Subtag Reviewer and MUST conform to
	other restrictions on variant subtags in this document.</t>

	<t>For ISO 3166-1 codes, if the newly assigned code's meaning
	is associated with the same UN M.49 code as another 'region'
	subtag, then the existing region subtag remains as the
	preferred value for that region and no new entry is created. A
	comment MAY be added to the existing region subtag indicating
	the relationship to the new ISO 3166-1 code.</t>

	<t>For ISO 3166-1 codes, if the newly assigned code's meaning
	is associated with a UN M.49 code that is not represented by
	an existing region subtag, then the Language Subtag Reviewer,
	as described in <xref target="registrationProc"/>, SHALL
	prepare a proposal for entering the appropriate UN M.49
	country code as an entry in the IANA registry. </t>

	<t>For ISO 3166-1 codes, if there is no associated UN numeric
	code, then the Language Subtag Reviewer SHALL petition the UN
	to create one. If there is no response from the UN within
	90 days of the request being sent, the Language Subtag
	Reviewer SHALL prepare a proposal for entering in the IANA
	registry, as soon as practical, a registered variant subtag as
	an alternate value for the new code. The form of the
	registered variant subtag will be at the discretion of the
	Language Subtag Reviewer and MUST conform to other
	restrictions on variant subtags in this document. This
	situation is very unlikely to ever occur.</t>

							</list>
						</t>
	<t>UN M.49 has codes for both "countries and areas" (such as
	'276' for Germany) and "geographical regions and
	sub-regions" (such as '150' for Europe). UN M.49 country or
	area codes for which there is no corresponding ISO 3166-1
	code MUST NOT be registered, except as a surrogate for an ISO
	3166-1 code that is blocked from registration by an existing
	subtag.<vspace blankLines="1"/>If such a code becomes
	necessary, then the maintenance agency for ISO 3166-1 SHALL
	first be petitioned to assign a code to the region. If the
	petition for a code assignment by ISO 3166-1 is refused or not
	acted on in a timely manner, the registration process
	described in <xref target="registrationProc"/> can then be
	used to register the corresponding UN M.49 code. This way, UN
	M.49 codes remain available as the value of last resort in
	cases where ISO 3166-1 reassigns a deprecated value in the
	registry.</t>

	<t>The redundant and grandfathered entries together form the
	complete list of tags registered under
	<xref target="RFC3066"/>. The redundant tags are those
	previously registered tags that can now be formed using the
	subtags defined in the registry. The grandfathered entries
	include those that can never be legal because they are
	'irregular' (that is, they do not match the 'langtag'
	production in <xref target="ABNF"></xref>), are limited by
	rule (subtags such as 'nyn' and 'min' look like the extlang
	production, but cannot be registered as extended language
	subtags), or their subtags are inappropriate for
	registration. All of the grandfathered tags are listed in
	either the 'regular' or the 'irregular' productions in the
	ABNF. Under <xref target="RFC4646"></xref> it was possible for
	grandfathered tags to become redundant. However, all of the
	tags for which this was possible became redundant before this
	document was produced. So the set of redundant and
	grandfathered tags is now permanent and immutable: new entries
	of either type MUST NOT be added and existing entries MUST NOT
	be removed. The decision-making process about which tags were
	initially grandfathered and which were made redundant is
	described in
	<xref target="RFC4645"/>.<vspace blankLines="1"/>Many of the
	grandfathered tags are deprecated -- indeed, they were
	deprecated even before <xref target="RFC4646"></xref>. For
	example, the tag "art-lojban" was deprecated in favor of the
	primary language subtag 'jbo'. These tags could have been made
	'redundant' by registering some of their subtags as
	'variants'. The 'variant-like' subtags in the grandfathered
	registrations SHALL NOT be registered in the future, even with
	a similar or identical meaning.</t>

	to use a subtag not currently in the IANA Language Subtag
	Registry or who wishes to add, modify, update, or remove
	information in existing records as permitted by this
	document.</t>

	<t>Only subtags of type 'language' and 'variant' will be
	considered for independent registration of new
	subtags. Subtags needed for stability and subtags necessary to
	keep the registry synchronized with ISO 639, ISO 15924, ISO
	3166, and UN M.49 within the limits defined by this document
	also use this process, as described in
	<xref target="maintreg"/> and subject to stability provisions
	as described in <xref target="ianastability"/>.</t>

	<t>Registration requests are accepted relating to information
	in the 'Comments', 'Deprecated', 'Description', 'Prefix',
	'Preferred-Value', 'Macrolanguage', or 'Suppress-Script' fields in a subtag's
	record as described in <xref target="ianastability"/>. Changes
	to all other fields in the IANA registry are NOT
	permitted.</t>

	<t>Registering a new subtag or requesting modifications to an
	existing tag or subtag starts with the requester filling out
	the registration form reproduced below. Note that each
	response is not limited in size so that the request can
	adequately describe the registration. The fields in the
	"Record Requested" section need to follow the requirements in
	<xref target="ianaformat"/> before the record will be
	approved.<figure anchor="regform.fig" title="The Language

	<t>Examples of completed registration forms can be found in
	<xref target="regexamples"/>. A complete list of approved
	registration forms is online through
	<eref target="http://www.iana.org">http://www.iana.org</eref>;
	readers should note that the Language Tag Registry is now
	obsolete and should instead look for the Language Subtag Registry.</t>

	<t>The subtag registration form MUST be sent to
	&lt;ietf-languages@iana.org&gt;. Registration requests receive
	a  two-week review period before being approved and submitted
	to IANA for inclusion in the registry. If modifications are
	made to the request during the course of the registration
	process (such as corrections to meet the requirements in
	<xref target="ianaformat"/> or to make the 'Description'
	fields unique for the given record type), the modified form
	MUST also be sent to &lt;ietf-languages@iana.org&gt; at least
	one week prior to submission to IANA.</t>

	<t>The ietf-languages list is an open list and can be joined
	by sending a request to
	&lt;ietf-languages-request@iana.org&gt;. The list can be
	hosted by IANA or any third party at the request of
	IESG.</t>

	<t>Before forwarding any registration to IANA, the Language
	Subtag Reviewer MUST ensure that all requirements in this
	document are met. This includes ensuring that values in the
	'Subtag' field match case according to the description in
	<xref target="subtagfield"/> and that 'Description' fields are
	unique for the given record type as described
	in <xref target="descriptionfield"></xref>. The Reviewer MUST
	also ensure that an appropriate File-Date record is included
	in the request, to assist IANA when updating the registry
	(see <xref target="iana-subtag-reg"></xref>).</t>
				
	<t>Some fields in both the registration form as well as the
	registry record itself permit the use of non-ASCII
	characters. Registration requests SHOULD use the UTF-8
	encoding for consistency and clarity. However, since some mail
	clients do not support this encoding, other encodings MAY be
	used for the registration request. The Language Subtag
	Reviewer is responsible for ensuring that the proper Unicode
	characters appear in both the archived request form and the
	registry record. In the case of a transcription or encoding
	error by IANA, the Language Subtag Reviewer will request that
	the registry be repaired, providing any necessary information
	to assist IANA.</t>

	<t>Extended language subtags (type 'extlang'), by definition,
	are always encompassed by another language. All records of
	type 'extlang' MUST, therefore, contain a 'Prefix' field at
	the time of registration. This 'Prefix' field can never be
	altered or removed, and requests to do so MUST be
	rejected.</t>

        <t>Variant subtags are usually registered for use
	with a particular range of language tags, and variant subtags
	based on the terminology of the language to which they are
	apply are encouraged. For example, the subtag 'rozaj' (Resian)
	is intended for use with language tags that start with the
	primary language subtag "sl" (Slovenian), since Resian is a
	dialect of Slovenian. Thus, the subtag 'rozaj' would be
	appropriate in tags such as "sl-Latn-rozaj" or
	"sl-IT-rozaj". This information is stored in the 'Prefix'
	field in the registry. Variant registration requests SHOULD
	include at least one 'Prefix' field in the registration
	form.</t>

        <t>Requests to assign an additional record of a given
	type with an existing subtag value MUST be rejected. For
	example, the variant subtag 'rozaj' already exists in the
	registry, so adding a second record of type 'variant' with the
	subtag 'rozaj' is prohibited.</t>

	<t>The 'Prefix' field for a given registered variant subtag
	exists in the IANA registry as a guide to usage. Additional
	'Prefix' fields MAY be added by filing an additional
	registration form. In that form, the "Any other relevant
	information:" field MUST indicate that it is the addition of a prefix.</t>

	<t>Requests to add a 'Prefix' field to a variant subtag that
	  imply a different semantic meaning SHOULD be rejected. For
	  example, a request to add the prefix "de" to the subtag
	  '1994' so that the tag "de-1994" represented some German
	  dialect or orthographic form would be rejected. The '1994'
	  subtag represents a particular Slovenian orthography, and the
	  additional registration would change or blur the semantic
	  meaning assigned to the subtag. A separate subtag SHOULD be
	  proposed instead.</t>

          <t>Requests to add a 'Prefix' to a
	  variant subtag that has no current 'Prefix' field MUST be
	  rejected. Variants are registered with no prefix because
	  they are potentially useful with many or even all
	  languages. Adding one or more 'Prefix' fields would be
	  potentially harmful to the use of the variant, since it
	  dramatically reduces the scope of the subtag (which is not
	  allowed under the <xref target="ianastability">stability
	  rules</xref> as opposed to broadening the scope of the
	  subtag, which is what the addition of a 'Prefix' normally
	  does. An example of such a "no-prefix" variant is the subtag
	  'fonipa', which represents the International Phonetic
	  Alphabet, a scheme that can be used to transcribe many
	  languages.</t>

	<t>The 'Description' fields provided in the request MUST
	contain at least one description written or transcribed into
	the Latin script; the request MAY also include additional
	'Description' fields in any script or language. The
	'Description' field is used for identification purposes and
	doesn't necessarily represent the actual native name of the
	language or variation. It also doesn't have to be in any
	particular language, but SHOULD be both suitable and
	sufficient to identify the item in the record. The Language
	Subtag Reviewer will check and edit any proposed 'Description'
	fields so as to ensure uniqueness and prevent collisions with
	'Description' fields in other records of the same type. If
	this occurs in an independent registration request, the
	Language Subtag Reviewer MUST resubmit the record to
	&lt;ietf-languages@iana.org&gt;, treating it as a modification of a
	request due to discussion, as described
	in <xref target="registrationProc"></xref>, unless the
	request's sole purpose is to introduce a duplicate
	'Description' field, in which case the request SHALL be
	rejected.</t>

	<t>The 'Description' field is not guaranteed to be
	stable. Corrections or clarifications of intent are examples
	of possible changes. Attempts to provide translations or
	transcriptions of entries in the registry (which, by
	definition, provide no new information) are unlikely to be
	approved.</t>

	<t>Soon after the two-week review period has passed, the
	Language Subtag Reviewer MUST take one of the following
	actions:<list style="symbols">

	<t>Explicitly accept the request and forward the form
	containing the record to be inserted or modified to
	&lt;iana@iana.org&gt; according to the procedure described in
	<xref target="maintreg"/>.</t>

	<t>Explicitly reject the request because of significant
	objections raised on the list or due to problems with
	constraints in this document (which MUST be explicitly
	cited).</t>

	<t>Extend the review period by granting an additional two-week
	increment to permit further discussion. After each two-week
	increment, the Language Subtag Reviewer MUST indicate on the
	list whether the registration has been accepted, rejected, or
	extended.</t>

					</list>
				</t>
	<t>Note that the Language Subtag Reviewer MAY raise objections
	on the list if he or she so desires. The important thing is
	that the objection MUST be made publicly.</t>

	<t>Sometimes the request needs to be modified as a result of
	discussion during the review period or due to requirements in
	this document. The applicant, Language Subtag Reviewer, or
	others MAY submit a modified version of the completed
	registration form, which will be considered in lieu of the
	original request with the explicit approval of the
	applicant. Such changes do not restart the two-week discussion
	period, although an application containing the final record
	submitted to IANA MUST appear on the list at least one week
	prior to the Language Subtag Reviewer forwarding the record to
	IANA. The applicant MAY modify a rejected application with
	more appropriate or additional information and submit it
	again; this starts a new two-week comment period.</t>

	<t>Registrations initiated due to the provisions of
	<xref target="maintreg"/> or <xref target="ianastability"/>
	SHALL NOT be rejected altogether (since they have to
	ultimately appear in the registry) and SHOULD be completed as
	quickly as possible. The review process allows list members to
	comment on the specific information in the form and the record
	it contains and thus help ensure that it is correct and
	consistent. The Language Subtag Reviewer MAY reject a specific
	version of the form, but MUST propose a suitable replacement,
	extending the review period as described above, until the form
	is in a format worthy of the reviewer's approval and meets with
	rough consensus of the list.</t>

	<t>Decisions made by the Language Subtag Reviewer MAY be
	appealed to the IESG <xref target="RFC2028"/> under the same
	rules as other IETF decisions <xref target="RFC2026"/>. This
	includes a decision to extend the review period or the failure
	to announce a decision in a clear and timely manner.</t>

	<t>The approved records appear in the Language Subtag
	Registry. The approved registration forms are available online
	from <eref target="http://www.iana.org">http://www.iana.org</eref>.</t>

	<t>Updates or changes to existing records follow the same
	  procedure as new registrations. The Language Subtag Reviewer
	  decides whether there is consensus to update the
	  registration following the two-week review period; normally,
	  objections by the original registrant will carry extra
	  weight in forming such a consensus.</t>

	<t>Registrations are permanent and stable. Once registered,
	  subtags will not be removed from the registry and will
	  remain a valid way in which to specify a specific language
	  or variant.</t>

	<t>Note: The purpose of the "Reference to published description" section in the
registration form is to aid in verifying whether a language is
	  registered or to which language or language variation a
	  particular subtag refers. In most cases, reference to an
	  authoritative grammar or dictionary of that language will be
	  useful; in cases where no such work exists, other well-known
	  works describing that language or in that language MAY be
	  appropriate. The Language Subtag Reviewer decides what
	  constitutes "good enough" reference material. This
	  requirement is not intended to exclude particular languages
	  or dialects due to the size of the speaker population or
	  lack of a standardized orthography. Minority languages will
	  be considered equally on their own merits.</t>

	<section anchor="possibleReg" title="Possibilities for Registration">

	<t>Possibilities for registration of subtags or information about subtags include:</t>

	<t><list style="symbols">
	<t>Primary language subtags for languages not listed in ISO 639 that are 
   not variants of any listed 
   or registered language MAY be registered. At the time this document was
   created, there were no examples of this form of subtag. Before
   attempting to register a language subtag, there MUST be an 
   attempt to register the language with ISO 639. Subtags MUST NOT be
   registered for languages defined by codes that exist in ISO 639-1,
   ISO 639-2, or ISO 639-3; that are 
   under consideration by the ISO 639 registration
   authorities; or that have never been attempted for registration with those
   authorities. If ISO 639 has previously rejected a language for registration,
   it is reasonable to assume that there must be additional, very compelling evidence
   of need before it will be registered as a primary language subtag
   in the IANA registry (to the extent that it is very unlikely that
   any subtags will be registered of this type).</t>

	<t>Dialect or other divisions or variations within a language,
	its orthography, writing system, regional or historical usage,
	transliteration or other transformation, or distinguishing
	variation MAY be registered as variant subtags. An example is
	the 'rozaj' subtag (the Resian dialect of Slovenian).</t>

	<t>The addition or maintenance of fields (generally of an
           informational nature) in tag or subtag records as described in
	   <xref target="ianaformat"/> is allowed.  Such changes are
           subject to the stability provisions in <xref target="ianastability"/>. 
           This includes 'Description', 'Comments', 'Deprecated', and 'Preferred-Value' fields
	for obsolete or withdrawn codes, or the addition of
	'Suppress-Script' or 'Macrolanguage' fields to primary language
	subtags, as well as other changes permitted by this document,
	such as the addition of an appropriate 'Prefix' field to a
	variant subtag.</t>

	<t>The addition of records and related field value changes
	necessary to reflect assignments made by ISO 639, ISO 15924,
	ISO 3166-1, and UN  M.49 as described in
	<xref target="ianastability"/> is allowed.</t>

	<section anchor="extensions" title="Extensions and the Extensions Registry">

	<t>Extension subtags are those introduced by single-character
	subtags ("singletons") other than 'x'. They are reserved for
	the generation of identifiers that contain a language
	component and are compatible with applications that understand
	language tags.</t>

	<t>The structure and form of extensions are defined by this document so that
    implementations can be created that are forward compatible with applications
    that might be created using singletons in the future. In addition, 
    defining a mechanism for maintaining singletons will lend 
    stability to this document by reducing the likely need for future revisions
    or updates.</t>

	<t>Single-character subtags are assigned by IANA using the
	"IETF Review" policy defined by <xref target="RFC5226"/>. This
	policy requires the development of an RFC, which SHALL define
	the name, purpose, processes, and procedures for maintaining
	the subtags. The maintaining or registering authority,
	including name, contact email, discussion list email, and URL
	location of the registry, MUST be indicated clearly in the
	RFC. The RFC MUST specify or include each of the following:

      <list style="symbols">
	<t>The specification MUST reference the specific version or revision 
         of this document that governs its creation and MUST reference
         this section of this document.</t>

	<t>The specification and all subtags defined by the specification
         MUST follow the ABNF and other rules for the formation of tags and
         subtags as defined in this document. In particular, it MUST specify 
         that case is not significant and that subtags MUST NOT exceed
         eight characters in length.</t>

	<t>The specification MUST specify a canonical representation.</t>

	<t>The specification of valid subtags MUST be available 
         over the Internet and at no cost.</t>

	<t>The specification MUST be in the public domain or available
         via a royalty-free license acceptable to the IETF and specified
         in the RFC.</t>

	<t>The specification MUST be versioned, and each version of the 
         specification MUST be numbered, dated, and stable.</t>

	<t>The specification MUST be stable. That is, extension subtags, 
         once defined by a specification, MUST NOT be retracted or change in 
         meaning in any substantial way.</t>

	<t>The specification MUST include, in a separate section, the
	registration form reproduced in this section (below) to be
	used in registering the extension upon publication as an
	RFC.</t>

	<t>IANA MUST be informed of changes to the contact information and 
         URL for the specification.</t>
					</list>
				</t>
	<t>IANA will maintain a registry of allocated single-character
	(singleton) subtags. This registry MUST use the record-jar
	format described by the ABNF in
	<xref target="fileformat"/>. Upon publication of an extension
	as an RFC, the maintaining authority defined in the RFC MUST
	forward this registration form to &lt;iesg@ietf.org&gt;, who MUST
	forward the request to &lt;iana@iana.org&gt;. The maintaining
	authority of the extension MUST maintain the accuracy of the
	record by sending an updated full copy of the record to
	&lt;iana@iana.org&gt; with the subject line "LANGUAGE TAG EXTENSION
	UPDATE" whenever content changes. Only the 'Comments',
	'Contact_Email', 'Mailing_List', and 'URL' fields MAY be
	modified in these updates.</t>

	<t>Failure to maintain this record, maintain the corresponding
	registry, or meet other conditions imposed by this section of
	this document MAY be appealed to the IESG
	<xref target="RFC2028"/> under the same rules as other IETF
	decisions (see <xref target="RFC2026"/>) and MAY result in the
	authority to maintain the extension being withdrawn or
	reassigned by the IESG.</t>

    subtags. Extension authors SHOULD avoid subtag relationships or
    canonicalization mechanisms that interfere with matching or
with length restrictions that sometimes exist in common protocols
    where the extension is used. In particular, applications MAY truncate the
subtags in doing matching or in fitting into limited lengths, so it is
RECOMMENDED that the most significant information be in the most
    significant (left-most) subtags and that the specification
    gracefully handle truncated subtags.</t>

	<t>When a language tag is to be used in a specific, known
	protocol, it is RECOMMENDED that the language tag not contain
	extensions not supported by that protocol. In addition, note
	that some protocols MAY impose upper limits on the length of
	the strings used to store or transport the language tag.</t>

	<section title="Update of the Language Subtag Registry" anchor="ianaconversion">

	<t>After the adoption of this document, the IANA Language Subtag
	Registry needed an update so that it would contain the complete
	set of subtags valid in a language tag. <xref target="RFC5645"/> describes the process used to create this update.</t>



	<t>Registrations that are in process under the rules defined
	in <xref target="RFC4646"/> when this document is adopted MUST
	be completed under the rules contained in this document.</t>

			</section>
           <section title="Applicability of the Subtag Registry">
          <t>The Language Subtag Registry is the source of data elements used to
construct language tags, following the rules described in this document.
Language tags are designed for indicating linguistic attributes of
various content, including not only text but also most media formats,
such as video or audio. They also form the basis for language and
locale negotiation in various protocols and APIs.</t>

<t>The registry is therefore applicable to many applications that need some
form of language identification, with these limitations:

<list style="symbols">
   <t>It is not designed to be the sole data source in the creation of a
language-selection user interface. For example, the registry does not
contain translations for subtag descriptions or for tags composed from the
subtags. Sources for localized data based on the registry are generally
available, notably <xref target="CLDR"/>. Nor does the
registry indicate which subtag 
combinations are particularly useful or relevant.</t>

    <t>It does not provide information indicating relationships between
different languages, such as might be used in a user interface to select
language tags hierarchically, regionally, or on some other organizational
model.</t>

     <t>It does not supply information about potential overlap between
different language tags, as the notion of what constitutes a language is
not precise: several different language tags might be reasonable choices
for the same given piece of content.</t>

     <t>It does not contain information about appropriate fallback choices
when performing language negotiation. A good fallback language might be
linguistically unrelated to the specified language. The fact that one
language is often used as a fallback language for another is usually a
result of outside factors, such as geography, history, or culture -- factors
that might not apply in all cases. For example, most people who use
Breton (a Celtic language used in the Northwest of France) would probably
prefer to be served French (a Romance language) if Breton isn't available.</t></list></t>

		<section title="Formation and Processing of Language Tags">

	<t>This section addresses how to use the information in the
	registry with the tag syntax to choose, form, and process
	language tags.</t>

	<section anchor="choice" title="Choice of Language Tag">
	
	<t>The guiding principle in forming language tags is to "tag
	content wisely." Sometimes there is a choice between several
	possible tags for the same content. The choice of which tag to
	use depends on the content and application in question, and
	some amount of judgment might be necessary when selecting a
	tag.</t>

	<t>Interoperability is best served when the same language tag
   is used consistently to represent the same language. If an application has
   requirements that make the rules here inapplicable, then that application
   risks damaging interoperability. It is strongly RECOMMENDED that
   users not define their own rules for language tag choice.</t>

	<t>Standards, protocols, and applications that reference this document normatively 
   but apply different rules to the ones given in this section MUST specify 
   how language tag selection varies from the guidelines given
   here.</t>

   <t>   To ensure consistent backward compatibility, this
   document contains several provisions to account for potential instability in the
   standards used to define the subtags that make up language tags.
   These provisions mean that no valid language tag can become
   invalid, nor will a language tag have a
   narrower scope in the future (it may have a broader scope). The
   most appropriate language tag for a given application or content
   item might evolve over time, but once applied, the tag itself
   cannot become invalid or have its meaning wholly change.</t>

   <t>A subtag SHOULD only be used when it adds useful distinguishing
   information to the tag. Extraneous subtags interfere with the
   meaning, understanding, and processing of language tags. In
   particular, users and implementations SHOULD follow the 'Prefix'
   and 'Suppress-Script' fields in the registry (defined in
   <xref target="ianaformat"/>): these fields provide guidance on when
   specific additional subtags SHOULD be used or avoided in a language
   tag.</t>
				
	<t>The choice of subtags used to form a language tag SHOULD
	follow these guidelines:<list style="numbers">

	<t>Use as precise a tag as possible, but no more specific than is justified. 
Avoid using subtags that are not important for distinguishing content
	  in an application. <list style="symbols">

	<t>For example, 'de' might suffice for tagging an email written in German, 
while "de-CH-1996" is probably unnecessarily precise for such a task.</t>

	<t>Note that some subtag sequences might not represent the
	language a casual user might expect. For example, the Swiss
	German (Schweizerdeutsch) language is represented by "gsw-CH"
	and not by "de-CH". This latter tag represents German ('de')
	as used in Switzerland ('CH'), also known as Swiss High German
	(Schweizer Hochdeutsch). Both are real languages, and
	distinguishing between them could be important to an
	application.</t>

			</list>	</t>
				
	<t>The script subtag SHOULD NOT be used to form language tags
	unless the script adds some distinguishing information to the
	tag. Script subtags were first formally defined in <xref target="RFC4646"/>. 

Their use can affect matching and
	subtag identification for implementations of 
	<xref target="RFC1766"/> or
	<xref target="RFC3066"/> (which are obsoleted by this document), as these subtags appear between the
	primary language and region subtags. 

Some applications can
	benefit from the use of script subtags in language tags, as
	long as the use is consistent for a given context. Script
	subtags are never appropriate for unwritten content (such as
	audio recordings). The field 'Suppress-Script' in the primary
	or extended language record in the registry indicates script
	subtags that do not add distinguishing information for most
	applications; this field defines when users SHOULD NOT include
	a script subtag with a particular primary language
	subtag. <vspace blankLines="1"/>For example, if an
	implementation selects content
	using <xref target="RFC4647">Basic Filtering</xref>
	(originally described in Section 14.4 of
	<xref target="RFC2616"/>) 
        and the user requested the language
	range "en-US", content labeled "en-Latn-US" will not match the
	request and thus not be selected. Therefore, it is important
	to know when script subtags will customarily be used and when
	they ought not be used.<vspace blankLines="1"/>For
	example:<list style="symbols">

	<t>The subtag 'Latn' should not be used with the primary
	language 'en' because nearly all English documents are written
	in the Latin script and it adds no distinguishing
	information. However, if a document were written in English
	mixing Latin script with another script such as Braille
	('Brai'), then it might be appropriate to choose to indicate
	both scripts to aid in content selection, such as the
	application of a style sheet.</t>

	<t>When labeling content that is unwritten (such as a
	recording of human speech), the script subtag should not be
	used, even if the language is customarily written in several
	scripts. Thus, the subtitles to a movie might use the tag
	"uz-Arab" (Uzbek, Arabic script), but the audio track for the
	same language would be tagged simply "uz". (The tag "uz-Zxxx"
	could also be used where content is not written, as the subtag
	'Zxxx' represents the "Code for unwritten documents".)</t>

							</list>
						</t>
		<t>If a tag or subtag has a 'Preferred-Value' field in
		its registry entry, then the value of that field
		SHOULD be used to form the language tag in preference
		to the tag or subtag in which the preferred value
		appears. <list style="symbols">

	<t>For example, use 'jbo' for Lojban in preference to the
	grandfathered tag "art-lojban".</t>

							</list>
						</t>
	<t>Use subtags or sequences of subtags for individual
	languages in preference to subtags for language collections. A
	"language collection" is a group of languages that are
	descended from a common ancestor, are spoken in the same
	geographical area, or are otherwise related. Certain language
	collections are assigned codes
	by <xref target="ISO639-5"></xref> (and some of
	these <xref target="ISO639-5"></xref> codes are also defined
	as collections in <xref target="ISO639-2"></xref>). These
	codes are included as primary language subtags in the
	registry. Subtags for a language collection in the registry
	have a 'Scope' field with a value of 'collection'. A subtag
	for a language collection is always preferred to less specific
	alternatives such as 'mul' and 'und' (see below), and a subtag
	representing a language collection MAY be used when more
	specific language information is not available. However, most
	users and implementations do not know there is a relationship
	between the collection and its individual languages. In
	addition, the relationship between the individual languages in
	the collection is not well defined; in particular, the
	languages are usually not mutually intelligible. Since the
	subtags are different, a request for the collection will
	typically only produce items tagged with the collection's
	subtag, not items tagged with subtags for the individual
	languages contained in the collection.
        <list style="symbols"><t>
        For example, collections are interpreted inclusively, so
	the subtag 'gem' (Germanic languages) could, but SHOULD NOT,
	be used with content that would be better tagged with "en"
	(English), "de" (German), or "gsw" (Swiss German,
	Alemannic). While 'gem' collects all of these (and other)
	languages, most implementations will not match 'gem' to the
	individual languages; thus, using the subtag will not produce
	the desired result.</t></list></t>

	<t><xref target="ISO639-2"/> has defined several codes
	included in the subtag registry that require additional care
	when choosing language tags. In most of these cases, where
	omitting the language tag is permitted, such omission is
	preferable to using these codes. Language tags SHOULD NOT
	incorporate these subtags as a prefix, unless the additional
	information conveys some value to the application.<list style="symbols">

								
	<t>The 'mul' (Multiple) primary language subtag identifies
	content in multiple languages. This subtag SHOULD NOT be used
	when a list of languages or individual tags for each content
	element can be used instead. For example, the
	'Content-Language' header <xref target="RFC3282"></xref>
	allows a list of languages to be used, not just a single
	language tag.</t>

	<t>The 'und' (Undetermined) primary language subtag identifies
	linguistic content whose language is not determined. This
	subtag SHOULD NOT be used unless a language tag is required
	and language information is not available or cannot be
	determined. Omitting the language tag (where permitted) is
	preferred. The 'und' subtag might be useful for protocols that
	require a language tag to be provided or where a primary
	language subtag is required (such as in "und-Latn"). The 'und'
	subtag MAY also be useful when matching language tags in
	certain situations.</t>

	<t>The 'zxx' (Non-Linguistic, Not Applicable) primary language
	subtag identifies content for which a language classification
	is inappropriate or does not apply. Some examples might
	include instrumental or electronic music; sound recordings
	consisting of nonverbal sounds; audiovisual materials with no
	narration, dialog, printed titles, or subtitles;
	machine-readable data files consisting of machine languages or
	character codes; or programming source code.</t>

	<t>The 'mis' (Uncoded) primary language subtag identifies
	content whose language is known but that does not currently
	have a corresponding subtag. This subtag SHOULD NOT be
	used. Because the addition of other codes in the future can
	render its application invalid, it is inherently unstable and
	hence incompatible with the stability goals of BCP 47. It is
	always preferable to use other subtags: either 'und' or (with
	prior agreement) private use subtags.</t>
							</list>
						</t>
	<t>Use variant subtags sparingly and in the correct
	order. Most variant subtags have one or more 'Prefix' fields
	in the registry that express the list of subtags with which they are
	appropriate. Variants SHOULD only be used with subtags
	that appear in one of these 'Prefix' fields. If a variant
	lists a second variant in one of its 'Prefix' fields, the
	first variant SHOULD appear directly after the second variant
	in any language tag where both occur. General purpose variants
	(those with no 'Prefix' fields at all) SHOULD appear after any
	other variant subtags. Order any remaining variants by placing
	the most significant subtag first. If none of the subtags is
	more significant or no relationship can be determined,
	alphabetize the subtags. Because variants are very
	specialized, using many of them together generally makes the
	tag so narrow as to override the additional precision
	gained. Putting the subtags into another order interferes with
	interoperability, as well as the overall interpretation of the
	tag.<vspace blankLines="1"/>For example:<list style="symbols">

        <t>The tag "en-scotland-fonipa" (English, Scottish dialect, IPA phonetic
	transcription) is correctly ordered because 'scotland' has a
	'Prefix' of "en", while 'fonipa' has no 'Prefix'
	field.</t>

       <t>The tag "sl-IT-rozaj-biske-1994" is
	correctly ordered: 'rozaj' lists "sl" as its sole 'Prefix';
	'biske' lists "sl-rozaj" as its sole 'Prefix'. The subtag '1994'
	has several prefixes, including "sl-rozaj". However, it
	follows both 'rozaj' and 'biske' because one of its 'Prefix'
	fields is "sl-rozaj-biske".</t></list></t>

        <t>The grandfathered tag "i-default" (Default Language) was originally registered
	according to <xref target="RFC1766"/> to meet the needs of
	<xref target="RFC2277"/>. It is not used to indicate a
	specific language, but rather to identify the condition or
	content used where the language preferences of the user cannot
	be established. It SHOULD NOT be used except as a means of
	labeling the default content for applications or protocols
	that require default language content to be labeled with that
	specific tag. It MAY also be used by an application or
	protocol to identify when the default language content is
	being returned.</t></list>

				</t>
	<section title="Tagging Encompassed Languages" anchor="macrolanguages">

        <t>Some primary language records in
	the registry have a 'Macrolanguage' field
	(<xref target="macrolang"></xref>) that contains a mapping
	from each "encompassed language" to its macrolanguage. The
	'Macrolanguage' mapping doesn't define what the relationship
	between the encompassed language and its macrolanguage is, nor
	does it define how languages encompassed by the same
	macrolanguage are related to each other. Two different
	languages encompassed by the same macrolanguage may differ
	from one another more than, say, French and Spanish do.</t>

        <t>A few specific macrolanguages, such as Chinese ('zh') and
	Arabic ('ar'), are handled
	differently. See <xref target="choiceUsingExtlang"></xref>.</t><t>The
	more specific encompassed language subtag SHOULD be used to
	form the language tag, although either the macrolanguage's
	primary language subtag or the encompassed language's subtag
	MAY be used. This means, for example, tagging Plains Cree with
	'crk' rather than 'cr' (Cree), and so forth.</t>
				
	<t>Each macrolanguage subtag's scope, by definition, includes
	all of its encompassed languages. Since the relationship
	between encompassed languages varies, users cannot assume that
	the macrolanguage subtag means any particular encompassed
	language, nor that any given pair of encompassed languages are
	mutually intelligible or otherwise interchangeable.</t>

	<t>Applications MAY use macrolanguage information to improve
	matching or language negotiation. For example, the information
	that 'sr' (Serbian) and 'hr' (Croatian) share a macrolanguage
	expresses a closer relation between those languages than
	between, say, 'sr' (Serbian) and 'ma' (Macedonian). However,
	this relationship is not guaranteed nor is it exclusive. For
	example, Romanian ('ro') and Moldavian ('mo') do not share a
	macrolanguage, but are far more closely related to each other
	than Cantonese ('yue') and Wu ('wuu'), which do share a
	macrolanguage.</t>

				

	</section><section title="Using Extended Language Subtags" anchor="choiceUsingExtlang">

        <t>To accommodate language tag
	forms used prior to the adoption of this document, language
	tags provide a special compatibility mechanism: the extended
	language subtag. Selected languages have been provided with
	both primary and extended language subtags. These include
	macrolanguages, such as Malay ('ms') and Uzbek ('uz'), that
	have a specific dominant variety that is generally synonymous
	with the macrolanguage. Other languages, such as the Chinese
	('zh') and Arabic ('ar') macrolanguages and the various sign
	languages ('sgn'), have traditionally used their primary
	language subtag, possibly coupled with various region subtags
	or as part of a registered grandfathered tag, to indicate the
	language.</t>

        <t>  With the adoption of this document, specific
	ISO 639-3 subtags became available to identify the languages
	contained within these diverse language families or
	groupings. This presents a choice of language tags where
	previously none existed:<list style="symbols">

        <t>Each	encompassed language's subtag SHOULD be used as the primary
	language subtag. For example, a document in Mandarin Chinese
	would be tagged "cmn" (the subtag for Mandarin Chinese) in
	preference to "zh" (Chinese).</t>

        <t>If compatibility is desired or needed, the encompassed subtag MAY be used as an
	extended language subtag. For example, a document in Mandarin
	Chinese could be tagged "zh-cmn" instead of either "cmn" or
	"zh".</t>

        <t>The macrolanguage or prefixing subtag MAY still be
	used to form the tag instead of the more specific encompassed
	language subtag. That is, tags such as "zh-HK" or "sgn-RU" are
	still valid.</t></list></t>

        <t>Chinese ('zh') provides a useful
	illustration of this.	In the past, various content has used
	tags beginning with the 'zh' subtag, with application-specific
	meaning being associated with region codes, private use
	sequences, or grandfathered registered values. This is because
	historically only the macrolanguage subtag 'zh' was available
	for forming language tags. However, the languages encompassed
	by the Chinese subtag 'zh' are, in the main, not mutually
	intelligible when spoken, and the written forms of these
	languages also show wide variation in form and usage.</t>

        <t>To provide compatibility, Chinese languages encompassed by the
	'zh' subtag are in the registry both as primary language
	subtags and as extended language subtags. For example, the ISO
	639-3 code for Cantonese is 'yue'. Content in Cantonese might
	historically have used a tag such as "zh-HK" (since Cantonese
	is commonly spoken in Hong Kong), although that tag actually
	means any type of Chinese as used in Hong Kong. With the
	availability of ISO 639-3 codes in the registry, content in
	Cantonese can be directly tagged using the 'yue' subtag. The
	content can use it as a primary language subtag, as in the tag
	"yue-HK" (Cantonese, Hong Kong). Or it can use an extended
	language subtag with 'zh', as in the tag "zh-yue-Hant"
	(Chinese, Cantonese, Traditional script).</t>

        <t>As noted above, applications can choose to use the macrolanguage subtag
	to form the tag instead of using the more specific encompassed
	language subtag. For example, an application with large
	quantities of data already using tags with the 'zh' (Chinese)
	subtag might continue to use this more general subtag even for
	new data, even though the content could be more precisely
	tagged with 'cmn' (Mandarin), 'yue' (Cantonese), 'wuu' (Wu),
	and so on. Similarly, an application already using tags that
	start with the 'ar' (Arabic) subtag might continue to use this
	more general subtag even for new data, which could be more
	precisely tagged with 'arb' (Standard Arabic).</t>

        <t>In some cases, the encompassed languages had tags registered for
	them during the RFC 3066 era. Those grandfathered tags not
	already deprecated or rendered redundant were deprecated in
	the registry upon adoption of this document. As grandfathered
	values, they remain valid for use, and some content or
	applications might use them. As with other grandfathered tags,
	since implementations might not be able to associate the
	grandfathered tags with the encompassed language subtag
	equivalents that are recommended by this document,
	implementations are encouraged to canonicalize tags for
	comparison purposes. Some examples of this include the tags
	"zh-hakka" (Hakka) and "zh-guoyu" (Mandarin or Standard
	Chinese).</t>

        <t>Sign languages share a mode of communication
	rather than a linguistic heritage. There are many sign
	languages that have developed independently, and the subtag
	'sgn' indicates only the presence of a sign language. A number
	of sign languages also had grandfathered tags registered for
	them during the RFC 3066 era. For example, the grandfathered
	tag "sgn-US" was registered to represent 'American Sign
	Language' specifically, without reference to the United
	States. This is still valid, but deprecated: a document in
	American Sign Language can be labeled either "ase" or
	"sgn-ase" (the 'ase' subtag is for the language called
	'American Sign Language').</t></section></section>

	<section anchor="meaning" title="Meaning of the Language Tag">

	<t>The meaning of a language tag is related to the meaning of
	the subtags that it contains. Each subtag, in turn, implies a
	certain range of expectations one might have for related
	content, although it is not a guarantee. For example, the use
	of a script subtag such as 'Arab' (Arabic script) does not
	mean that the content contains only Arabic characters. It does
	mean that the language involved is predominantly in the Arabic
	script. Thus, a language tag and its subtags can encompass a
	very wide range of variation and yet remain appropriate in
	each particular instance.</t>

	<t>Validity of a tag is not the only factor determining its
	usefulness. While every valid tag has a meaning, it might not
	represent any real-world language usage. This is unavoidable
	in a system in which subtags can be combined freely. For
	example, tags such as "ar-Cyrl-CO" (Arabic, Cyrillic script,
	as used in Colombia) or "tlh-Kore-AQ-fonipa" (Klingon, Korean
	script, as used in Antarctica, IPA phonetic transcription) are
	both valid and unlikely to represent a useful combination of
	language attributes.</t>

	<t>The meaning of a given tag doesn't depend on the context in
	which it appears. The relationship between a tag's meaning and
	the information objects to which that tag is applied, however,
	can vary.<list style="symbols">

	<t>For a single information object, the associated language tags might be 
   interpreted as the set of languages that is necessary for a complete 
   comprehension of the complete object. Example: Plain text
   documents.</t>

	<t>For an aggregation of information objects, the associated language tags
   could be taken as the set of languages used inside components of that
   aggregation.  Examples: Document stores and libraries.</t>

	<t>For information objects whose purpose is to provide alternatives, the
   associated language tags could be regarded as a hint that the content is 
   provided in several languages and that one has to inspect each of the
   alternatives in order to find its language or languages. In this case, the
   presence of multiple tags might not mean that one needs to be multilingual to
    get complete understanding of the document. Example: MIME
    multipart/alternative <xref target="RFC2046"></xref>.</t>

	<t>For markup languages, such as HTML and XML, language information can be 
   added to each part of the document identified by the markup structure 
   (including the whole document itself). For example, one could write
    &lt;span lang="fr"&gt;C'est la vie.&lt;/span&gt; inside a German document; 
    the German-speaking user could then access a French-German dictionary 
    to find out what the marked section meant. If the user were listening to that 
    document through a speech synthesis interface, this formation could be used 
    to signal the synthesizer to appropriately apply French text-to-speech 
    pronunciation rules to that span of text, instead of applying the 
    inappropriate German rules. </t>

     <t>For markup languages and document formats that allow the
     audience to be identified, a language tag could indicate the
     audience(s) appropriate for that document. For example, the same
     HTML document described in the preceding bullet might have an
     HTTP header "Content-Language: de" to indicate that the intended
     audience for the file is German (even though three words appear
     and are identified as being in French within it).</t>

	<t>For systems and APIs, language tags form the basis for most
	implementations of locale identifiers. For example, see
	Unicode's CLDR (Common Locale Data Repository)
	(see <xref target="UTS35">UTS #35</xref>) project.</t>

					</list>
				</t>
		
	<t>Language tags are related when they contain a similar
	sequence of subtags. For example, if a language tag B contains
	language tag A as a prefix, then B is typically "narrower" or
	"more specific" than A. Thus, "zh-Hant-TW" is more specific
	than "zh-Hant".</t>

	<t>This relationship is not guaranteed in all cases: specifically, 
languages that begin with the same sequence of subtags are NOT guaranteed to be 
mutually intelligible, although they might be. For example, the tag "az"
shares a prefix with both "az-Latn" (Azerbaijani written using the Latin script)
and "az-Cyrl" (Azerbaijani written using the Cyrillic script). A
	  person fluent in one script might not be able to read the
	  other, even though the linguistic content (e.g., what would
	  be heard if both texts were read aloud) might be
	  identical. Content tagged as "az" most probably is written
	  in just one script and thus might not be intelligible to a
	  reader familiar with the other script.</t>

	<t>Similarly, not all subtags specify an actual distinction in
	language. For example, the tags "en-US" and "en-CA" mean,
	roughly, English with features generally thought to be
	characteristic of the United States and Canada, respectively.
	They do not imply that a significant dialectical boundary
	exists between any arbitrarily selected point in the United
	States and any arbitrarily selected point in Canada. Neither
	does a particular region subtag imply that linguistic
	distinctions do not exist within that region.</t>

			</section>

	<section anchor="lists" title="Lists of Languages"><t>In some
	applications, a single content item might best be associated
	with more than one language tag. Examples of such a usage
	include:<list style="symbols">

       <t>Content items that contain multiple, distinct
	varieties. Often this is used to indicate an appropriate
	audience for a given content item when multiple choices might
	be appropriate. Examples of this could
	include: <list style="symbols">

        <t>Metadata about the
	appropriate audience for a movie title. For example, a DVD
	might label its individual audio tracks 'de' (German), 'fr'
	(French), and 'es' (Spanish), but the overall title would list
	"de, fr, es" as its overall audience.</t>

        <t>A French/English,
	English/French dictionary tagged as both "en" and "fr" to
	specify that it applies equally to French and English.</t>

        <t>A side-by-side or interlinear translation of a document, as is
	commonly done with classical works in Latin or
	Greek.</t></list> </t>

        <t>Content items that contain a single
	language but that require multiple levels of specificity. For
	example, a library might wish to classify a particular work as
	both Norwegian ('no') and as Nynorsk ('nn') for audiences
	capable of appreciating the distinction or needing to select
	content more narrowly.</t></list></t></section>

<section anchor="length" title="Length Considerations">

	<t>There is no defined upper limit on the size of language
	tags. While historically most language tags have consisted of
	language and region subtags with a combined total length of up
	to six characters, larger tags have always been both possible
	and have actually appeared in use. </t>

	<t>Neither the language tag syntax nor other requirements in
	this document impose a fixed upper limit on the number of
	subtags in a language tag (and thus an upper bound on the size
	of a tag). The language tag syntax suggests that, depending on
	the specific language, more subtags (and thus a longer tag)
	are sometimes necessary to completely identify the language
	for certain applications; thus, it is possible to envision
	long or complex subtag sequences. </t>

	<section anchor="bufferLimits" title="Working with Limited Buffer Sizes">
	
	<t>Some applications and protocols are forced to allocate
	fixed buffer sizes or otherwise limit the length of a language
	tag. A conformant implementation or specification MAY refuse
	to support the storage of language tags that exceed a
	specified length. Any such limitation SHOULD be clearly
	documented, and such documentation SHOULD include what happens
	to longer tags (for example, whether an error value is
	generated or the language tag is truncated). A protocol that
	allows tags to be truncated at an arbitrary limit, without
	giving any indication of what that limit is, has the potential
	to cause harm by changing the meaning of tags in substantial ways. </t>

	<t>In practice, most language tags do not require more than a
	few subtags and will not approach reasonably sized buffer
	limitations; see <xref target="choice"/>.</t>

	<t>Some specifications or protocols have limits on tag length
	but do not have a fixed length limitation. For example,
	<xref target="RFC2231"/>  has no explicit length limitation:
	the length available for the language tag is constrained by
	the length of other header components (such as the charset's
	name) coupled with the 76-character limit in
	<xref target="RFC2047"/>. Thus, the "limit" might be 50 or
	more characters, but it could potentially be quite small.</t>

	<t>The considerations for assigning a buffer limit are:<list>

	<t>Implementations SHOULD NOT truncate language tags unless
	the meaning of the tag is purposefully being changed, or
	unless the tag does not fit into a limited buffer size
	specified by a protocol for storage or transmission.</t>

	<t>Implementations SHOULD warn the user when a tag is
	truncated since truncation changes the semantic meaning of the
	tag.</t>

	<t>Implementations of protocols or specifications that are
	space constrained but do not have a fixed limit SHOULD use the
	longest possible tag in preference to truncation.</t>

							
	<t>Protocols or specifications that specify limited buffer
	sizes for language tags MUST allow for language tags of at
	least 35 characters. Note that <xref target="RFC4646"></xref>
	recommended a minimum field size of 42 characters
	because it included all three elements of the 'extlang'
	production. Two of these are now permanently reserved, so a
	registered primary language subtag of the maximum length of
	8 characters is now longer than the longest
	language-extlang combination. Protocols or specifications that
	commonly use extensions or private use subtags might wish to
	reserve or recommend a longer "minimum buffer" size.</t>
						</list>
					</t>
	<t>The following illustration shows how the 35-character
	recommendation was derived:</t>

	<section anchor="truncation" title="Truncation of Language Tags">

	<t>Truncation of a language tag alters the meaning of the tag,
	and thus SHOULD be avoided. However, truncation of language
	tags is sometimes necessary due to limited buffer sizes. Such
	truncation MUST NOT permit a subtag to be chopped off in the
	middle or the formation of invalid tags (for example, one
	ending with the "-" character).</t>

	<t>This means that applications or protocols that truncate tags MUST do so
     by progressively removing subtags along with their preceding "-"
     from the right side of the language tag until the tag is short
     enough for the given buffer. If the resulting tag ends with a
     single-character subtag, that subtag and its preceding "-" MUST
     also be removed. For example:</t>

	<section title="Canonicalization of Language Tags" anchor="canonical">

	<t>Since a particular language tag can be used by many
	processes, language tags SHOULD always be created or generated
	in canonical form.</t>

	<t>A language tag is in 'canonical form' when the tag is
	well-formed according to the rules in Sections
	<xref format="counter" target="syntax"/> and
	<xref format="counter" target="sources"/> and it has been
	canonicalized by applying each of the following steps in order, using data from
	the IANA registry (see <xref target="ianaformat"/>):<list style="numbers">
						
	<t>Extension sequences are ordered into case-insensitive ASCII
	order by singleton subtag.<list style="symbols">

        <t>For example, the subtag sequence '-a-babble' comes before
	'-b-warble'.</t></list></t>

       <t>Redundant or grandfathered tags
	are replaced by their 'Preferred-Value', if there is
	one.<list style="symbols">

        <t>The field-body of the
	'Preferred-Value' for grandfathered and redundant tags is an
	"extended language range" <xref target="RFC4647"></xref> and
	might consist of more than one subtag.</t>

       <t> 'Preferred-Value'
	fields in the registry provide mappings from deprecated tags
	to modern equivalents. Many of these were created before the
	adoption of this document (such as the mapping of "no-nyn" to
	"nn" or "i-klingon" to "tlh"). Others are the result of later
	registrations or additions to the registry as permitted or
	required by this document (for example, "zh-hakka" was
	deprecated in favor of the ISO 639-3 code 'hak' when this
	document was adopted).</t></list></t>

        <t>Subtags are replaced
	by their 'Preferred-Value', if there is one. For extlangs, the
	original primary language subtag is also replaced if there is
	a primary language subtag in the
	'Preferred-Value'.<list style="symbols">

        <t>The field-body of the
	'Preferred-Value' for extlangs is an "extended language range"
	and typically maps to a primary language subtag. For example,
	the subtag sequence "zh-hak" (Chinese, Hakka) is replaced with
	the subtag 'hak' (Hakka).</t>

        <t>Most of the non-extlang
	subtags are either Region subtags where the country name or
	designation has changed or clerical corrections to ISO
	639-1.</t></list></t></list>

				</t>
	<t>The canonical form contains no 'extlang' subtags. There is
	an alternate 'extlang form' that maintains or reinstates
	extlang subtags. This form can be useful in environments where
	the presence of the 'Prefix' subtag is considered beneficial in
	matching or selection
	(see <xref target="choiceUsingExtlang"></xref>).</t>

        <t>A language tag is in 'extlang form' when the tag is well-formed
	according to the rules in Sections <xref format="counter" target="syntax"></xref>
	and <xref format="counter" target="sources"></xref> and it has been processed
	by applying each of the following two steps in order, using
	data from the IANA registry: 

<list style="numbers">

         <t>The language tag is first transformed into canonical form,
         as described above.</t>

        <t>If the language tag starts with a
         primary language subtag that is also an extlang subtag, then
         the language tag is prepended with the extlang's
         'Prefix'.<list style="symbols">

         <t anchor="symbols">For example,
         "hak-CN" (Hakka, China) has the primary language subtag
         'hak', which in turn has an 'extlang' record with a 'Prefix'
         'zh' (Chinese). The extlang form is "zh-hak-CN" (Chinese,
         Hakka, China).</t>

        <t>Note that Step 2 (prepending a prefix)
         can restore a subtag that was removed by Step 1
         (canonicalizing).</t></list></t></list>

</t><t>Example: The language tag "en-a-aaa-b-ccc-bbb-x-xyz" is in canonical form,
while "en-b-ccc-bbb-a-aaa-X-xyz" is well-formed and potentially valid
	  (extensions 'a' and 'b' are not defined as of the
	  publication of this document) but not in canonical form
	  (the extensions are not in alphabetical order).</t>

	<t>Example: Although the tag "en-BU" (English as used in
	Burma) maintains its validity, the language tag "en-BU" is not
	in canonical form because the 'BU' subtag has a canonical
	mapping to 'MM' (Myanmar).</t>

	<t>Canonicalization of language tags does not imply anything
	about the use of upper- or lowercase letters when processing or
	comparing subtags (and as described in
	<xref target="syntax"/>). All comparisons MUST be performed in
	a case-insensitive manner.</t>

	<t>When performing canonicalization of language tags,
	processors MAY regularize the case of the subtags (that is,
	this process is OPTIONAL), following the case used in the
	registry (see <xref target="casing"></xref>).</t>
				
	<t>If more than one variant appears within a tag, processors
	MAY reorder the variants to obtain better matching behavior or
	more consistent presentation. Reordering of the variants
	SHOULD follow the recommendations for variant ordering
	in <xref target="choice"></xref>.</t>

        <t>If the field	'Deprecated' appears in a registry record without an
	accompanying 'Preferred-Value' field, then that tag or subtag
	is deprecated without a replacement. These values are
	canonical when they appear in a language tag. However, tags
	that include these values SHOULD NOT be selected by users or
	generated by implementations.</t>

	<t>An extension MUST define any relationships that exist between the 
various subtags in the extension and thus MAY define an alternate 
canonicalization scheme for the extension's subtags. Extensions MAY 
define how the order of the extension's subtags is interpreted. For
	  example, an extension could define that its subtags are in
	  canonical order when the subtags are placed 
into ASCII order: that is, "en-a-aaa-bbb-ccc" instead of "en-a-ccc-bbb-aaa". Another
extension might define that the order of the subtags influences their
semantic meaning (so that "en-b-ccc-bbb-aaa" has a different value from 
"en-b-aaa-bbb-ccc"). However, extension specifications SHOULD be
	  designed so that they are tolerant of the typical processes
	  described in <xref target="extensions"/>.</t>

			</section>
	<section anchor="privateuse" title="Considerations for Private Use Subtags">

	<t>Private use subtags, like all other
	subtags, MUST conform to the format and content constraints in
	the ABNF. Private use subtags have no meaning outside the private agreement between
        the parties that intend to use or exchange language tags that
	employ them. The same subtags MAY be used with a different
	meaning under a separate private agreement. They SHOULD NOT be
	used where alternatives exist and SHOULD NOT be used in
	content or protocols intended for general use. </t>

	<t>Private use subtags are simply useless for
        information exchange without prior arrangement. The value and 
        semantic meaning of private use tags and of the subtags used 
        within such a language tag are not defined by this document.</t>
			
	<t>Private use sequences introduced by the 'x' singleton are
	completely opaque to users or implementations outside of the
	private use agreement. So, in addition to private use subtag
	sequences introduced by the singleton subtag 'x', the Language
	Subtag Registry provides private use language, script, and
	region subtags derived from the private use codes assigned by
	the underlying standards. These subtags are valid for use in
	forming language tags; they are RECOMMENDED over the 'x'
	singleton private use subtag sequences because they convey
	more information via their linkage to the language tag's
	inherent structure.</t>

	<t>For example, the region subtags 'AA', 'ZZ', and those in the
	ranges 'QM'-'QZ' and 'XA'-'XZ' (derived from the ISO 3166-1
	private use codes) can be used to form a language tag. A tag
	such as "zh-Hans-XQ" conveys a great deal of public,
	interchangeable information about the language material (that
	it is Chinese in the simplified Chinese script and is suitable
	for some geographic region 'XQ'). While the precise geographic
	region is not known outside of private agreement, the tag
	conveys far more information than an opaque tag such as
	"x-somelang" or even "zh-Hans-x-xq" (where the 'xq' subtag's
	meaning is entirely opaque).</t>

	<t>However, in some cases content tagged with private use
	subtags can interact with other systems in a different and
	possibly unsuitable manner compared to tags that use opaque,
	privately defined subtags, so the choice of the best approach
	sometimes depends on the particular domain in question.</t>

		<section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">

	<t>This section deals with the processes and requirements necessary 
  for IANA to maintain the subtag and extension
  registries as defined by this document and in accordance with the
  requirements of <xref target="RFC5226"/>.</t>

	<t>The impact on the IANA maintainers of the two registries
	defined by this document will be a small increase in the
	frequency of new entries or updates. IANA also is required to
	create a new mailing list (described below in
	<xref target="iana-subtag-reg"/>) to announce registry changes
	and updates.</t>

	<section title="Language Subtag Registry" anchor="iana-subtag-reg">

	<t>IANA updated the registry using instructions and content provided in a
	companion document <xref target="RFC5645"/>. The criteria and
	process for selecting the updated set of records are described
	in that document. The updated set of records represents no
	impact on IANA, since the work to create it will be performed
	externally. </t>

	<t>Future work on the Language Subtag Registry includes the
	following activities:<list style="symbols">

	<t>Inserting or replacing whole records. These records are
	preformatted for IANA by the Language Subtag Reviewer, as
	described in <xref target="maintreg"/>.</t>

	<t>Archiving and making publicly available the registration forms.</t>

	<t>Announcing each updated version of the registry on the
	"ietf-languages-announcements@iana.org" mailing list.</t>

					</list>
				</t>
	<t>Each registration form sent to IANA contains a single
	record for incorporation into the registry. The form will be
	sent to &lt;iana@iana.org&gt; by the Language Subtag Reviewer. It
	will have a subject line indicating whether the enclosed form
	represents an insertion of a new record (indicated by the word
	"INSERT" in the subject line) or a replacement of an existing
	record (indicated by the word "MODIFY" in the subject
	line). At no time can a record be deleted from the
	registry.</t>

	<t>IANA will extract the record from the form and place the inserted or 
 modified record into the appropriate section of the Language Subtag 
 Registry, grouping the records by their 'Type' field. Inserted records 
can be placed anywhere within the appropriate section; there is no 
 guarantee that the registry's records will be placed in any particular 
 order except that they will always be grouped by 'Type'. Modified 
 records overwrite the record they replace.</t>

	<t>Whenever an entry is created or modified in the registry, the
'File-Date' record at the start of the registry is updated to reflect
the most recent modification date. The date format SHALL be the
"full-date" format of <xref target="RFC3339"></xref>. The date SHALL be
the date on which that version of the registry was first published by
IANA. There SHALL be at most one version of the registry published in
a day. A 'File-Date' record is also included in each request to IANA to insert
or modify records, indicating the acceptance date of the records in the
request.</t><t>The updated registry file MUST use the UTF-8 character
	encoding, and IANA MUST check the registry file for proper
	encoding. Non-ASCII characters can be sent to IANA by
	attaching the registration form to the email message or by
	using various encodings in the mail message body (UTF-8 is
	recommended). IANA will verify any unclear or corrupted
	characters with the Language Subtag Reviewer prior to posting
	the updated registry.</t>

	<t>IANA will also archive and make publicly available from
	http://www.iana.org each registration form. Note that multiple registrations can
	pertain to the same record in the registry.</t>

	<t>Developers who are dependent upon the Language Subtag
	  Registry sometimes would like to be informed of changes in
	  the registry so that they can update their
	  implementations. When any change is made to the Language
	  Subtag Registry, IANA will send an announcement message to
	  &lt;ietf-languages-announcements@iana.org&gt; (a self-subscribing
	  list to which only IANA can post). </t>
			</section>

	<section title="Extensions Registry" anchor="iana-ext-reg">

	<t>The Language Tag Extensions Registry can contain at most 35
	records, and thus changes to this registry are expected to be
	very infrequent. </t>

	<t>Future work by IANA on the Language Tag Extensions Registry
	is limited to two cases. First, the IESG MAY request that new
	records be inserted into this registry from time to
	time. These requests MUST include the record to insert in the
	exact format described in <xref target="extensions"/>. In
	addition, there MAY be occasional requests from the
	maintaining authority for a specific extension to update the
	contact information or URLs in the record. These requests MUST

		</section>

		<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

	<t>Language tags used in content negotiation, like any other
	information exchanged on the Internet, might be a source of
	concern because they might be used to infer the nationality of
	the sender, and thus identify potential targets for
	surveillance.</t>

	<t>This is a special case of the general problem that anything sent is visible 
to the receiving party and possibly to third parties as well. It is
	  useful to be aware that such concerns can exist in some
	  cases.</t>

	<t>The evaluation of the exact magnitude of the threat, and any possible 
countermeasures, is left to each application protocol
	  (see <xref target="RFC3552">BCP 72</xref> for best current
	  practice guidance on security threats and defenses).</t>

	<t>The language tag associated with a particular information item is of no
consequence whatsoever in determining whether that content might
contain possible homographs. The fact that a text is tagged as being
in one language or using a particular script subtag provides no
	  assurance whatsoever that it does not contain characters
	  from scripts other than the one(s) associated with or
	  specified by that language tag.</t>

	<t> Since there is no limit to the number of variant, private use, and extension 
subtags, and consequently no limit on the possible length of a tag, 
implementations need to guard against buffer overflow attacks.  See
	  <xref target="length"/> for details on language tag
	  truncation, which can occur as a consequence of defenses
	  against buffer overflow.</t>

	<t>To prevent denial-of-service attacks, applications SHOULD
	NOT depend on either the Language Subtag Registry or the
	Language Tag Extensions Registry being always
	accessible. Additionally, although the specification of valid
	subtags for an extension (see <xref target="extensions"/>)
	MUST be available over the Internet, implementations SHOULD
	NOT mechanically depend on those sources being always
	accessible.</t>

       <t>The registries specified in this document
	are not suitable for frequent or real-time access to, or
	retrieval of, the full registry contents. Most applications do
	not need registry data at all. For others, being able to
	validate or canonicalize language tags as of a particular
	registry date will be sufficient, as the registry contents
	change only occasionally. Changes are announced to
	&lt;ietf-languages-announcements@iana.org&gt;. This mailing list is
   intended for interested organizations and individuals, not for bulk
   subscription to trigger automatic software updates. The size of the
   registry makes it unsuitable for automatic software updates.
   Implementers considering integrating the Language Subtag Registry in
   an automatic updating scheme are strongly advised to distribute only
   suitably encoded differences, and only via their own infrastructure --
   not directly from IANA. </t>
<t>
Changes, or the absence thereof, can also easily be detected by
   looking at the 'File-Date' record at the start of the registry, or
   by using features of the protocol used for downloading, without
   having to download the full registry. At the time of publication of
   this document, IANA is making the Language Tag Registry available
   over HTTP 1.1. The proper way to update a local copy of the Language
   Subtag Registry using HTTP 1.1 is to use a conditional GET
	<xref target="RFC2616"/>.</t>

		</section>
		<section anchor="charset" title="Character Set Considerations">
			
     <t>The syntax in this document requires that language tags use only
the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and HYPHEN-MINUS, which are present in 
most character sets, so the composition of language tags shouldn't have any 
character set issues.</t>

    <t>The rendering of text based on the language tag is not
    addressed here. Historically, some processes have relied on the
    use of character set/encoding information (or other external
    information) in order to infer how a specific string of characters
    should be rendered. Notably, this applies to language- and
    culture-specific variations of Han ideographs as used in Japanese,
    Chinese, and Korean, where use of, for example, a Japanese
    character encoding such as EUC-JP implies that the text itself is
    in Japanese. When language tags are applied to spans of text,
    rendering engines might be able to use that information to better
    select fonts or make other rendering choices, particularly where
    languages with distinct writing traditions use the same
    characters.</t>

		<section anchor="changes" title="Changes from RFC 4646">

		<t>The main goal for this revision of RFC 4646
		was to incorporate two new parts of ISO 639 (ISO 639-3

		permits the identification of many more languages and
		language collections than previously supported.</t>

	<t>The specific changes in this document to meet these goals are:
<list style="symbols">
		<t>Defined the incorporation of ISO 639-3 and ISO
		639-5 codes for use as primary and extended language
		subtags. It also permanently reserves and disallows
		the use of additional 'extlang' subtags. The changes
		necessary to achieve this were:<list>

		<t>Modified the ABNF comments.</t>
		<t>Updated various registration and stability
		requirements sections to reference ISO 639-3 and ISO
		639-5 in addition to ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2.</t>

		<t>Edited the text to eliminate references to extended

		<t>Explained the change in the section on extended language subtags.</t>
						</list>
					</t>
	<t>Changed the ABNF related to grandfathered tags. The
	irregular tags are now listed. Well-formed grandfathered tags
	are now described by the 'langtag' production, and the
	'grandfathered' production was removed as a result. Also:
	added description of both types of grandfathered tags to
	<xref target="preexisreg"/>.</t>

	<t>Added the paragraph on "collections" to <xref target="choice"/>.</t>
	<t>Changed the capitalization rules for 'Tag' fields in
	<xref target="ianaformat"/>.</t>

	<t>Split Section 3.1 up into subsections.</t>

	<t>Modified Section 3.5 to allow 'Suppress-Script' fields to be
	added, modified, or removed via the registration process. This
	was an erratum from RFC 4646.</t>

	<t>Modified examples that used region code 'CS' (formerly
	Serbia and Montenegro) to use 'RS' (Serbia) instead.</t>

	<t>Modified the rules for creating and maintaining record
	'Description' fields to prevent duplicates, including inverted
	duplicates.</t>

	<t>Removed the lengthy description of why RFC 4646 was created
	from this section, which also caused the removal of the
	reference to XML Schema.</t>

	<t>Modified the text in Section 2.1 to place more emphasis on
	the fact that language tags are not case sensitive.</t>

	<t>Replaced the example "fr-Latn-CA" in Section 2.1 with
	"sr-Latn-RS" and "az-Arab-IR" because "fr-Latn-CA" doesn't
	respect the 'Suppress-Script' on 'Latn' with 'fr'.</t>

	<t>Changed the requirements for well-formedness to make
	singleton repetition checking optional (it is required for
	validity checking) in <xref target="conformance"/>.</t>

	<t>Changed the text in <xref target="conformance"/> referring
	to grandfathered checking to note that the list is now
	included in the ABNF.</t>

	<t>Modified and added text to
	<xref target="subtagreviewer"/>. The job description was
	placed first. A note was added making clear that the Language
	Subtag Reviewer may delegate various non-critical duties,
	including list moderation. Finally, additional text was added
	to make the appointment process clear and to clarify that
	decisions and performance of the reviewer are appealable.</t>

	<t>Added text to <xref target="registrationProc"/> clarifying
	that the ietf-languages@iana.org list is operated by whomever
	the IESG appoints.</t>

	<t>Added text to <xref target="descriptionfield"/> clarifying
	that the first Description in a 'language' record matches the
	corresponding Reference Name for the language in ISO
	639-3.</t>

	<t>Modified <xref target="conformance"/> to define classes of
	conformance related to specific tags (formerly 'well-formed'
	and 'valid' referred to implementations). Notes were added
	about the removal of 'extlang' from the ABNF provided in RFC
	4646, allowing for well-formedness using this older
	definition. Reference to RFC 3066 well-formedness was also
	added.</t>

	<t>Added text to the end of <xref target="recordformat"/>
	noting that future versions of this document might add new
	field types to the registry format and recommending that
	implementations ignore any unrecognized fields.</t>

	<t>Added text about what the lack of a 'Suppress-Script' field
	means in a record to <xref target="suppressfield"/>.</t>

	<t>Added text allowing the correction of misspellings and
	typographic errors to <xref target="descriptionfield"/>.</t>

	<t>Added text to <xref target="prefixfield"/> disallowing
	'Prefix' field conflicts (such as circular prefix
	references).</t>

<t>Modified text in <xref target="registrationProc"/> to require the
  subtag reviewer to announce his/her decision (or extension)
  following the two-week period. Also clarified that any decision or
  failure to decide can be appealed.</t>

	<t>Modified text in <xref target="choice"/> to include the
	(heretofore anecdotal) guiding principle of tag choice, and
	clarifying the non-use of script subtags in non-written
	applications.</t>


<t>Prohibited multiple use of the same variant in a tag
  (i.e., "de-1901-1901"). Previously, this was only a recommendation
  ("SHOULD").</t>

	<t>Removed inappropriate <xref target="RFC2119"/> language
	from the illustration in <xref target="bufferLimits"/>.</t>

	<t>Replaced the example of deprecating "zh-guoyu" with
	"zh-hakka"-&gt;"hak" in <xref target="canonical"/>, noting
	that it was this document that caused the change.</t>

	<t>Replaced the section in <xref target="choice"></xref>
	dealing with "mul"/"und" to include the subtags 'zxx' and
	'mis', as well as the tag "i-default". A normative reference
	to RFC 2277 was added.</t>


	<t>Added text to <xref target="registrationProc"/> clarifying
	that any modifications of a registration request must be sent
	to the &lt;ietf-languages@iana.org&gt; list before submission to
	IANA.</t>

	<t>Changed the ABNF for the record-jar format from using the
	LWSP production to use a folding whitespace production similar
	to obs-FWS in <xref target="RFC5234"/>. This effectively
	prevents unintentional blank lines inside a field. </t>

	<t>Clarified and revised text in Sections
	<xref format="counter" target="maintreg"/>,
	<xref format="counter" target="registrationProc"/>, and
	<xref format="counter" target="iana-subtag-reg"/> to clarify that the Language
	Subtag Reviewer sends the complete registration forms to IANA,
	that IANA extracts the record from the form, and that the
	forms must also be archived separately from the registry.</t>

	<t>Added text to <xref target="iana"/> requiring IANA to send
	an announcement to an ietf-languages-announcements list
	whenever the registry is updated.</t>

	<t>Modification of the registry to use UTF-8 as its character
	encoding. This also entails additional instructions to IANA
	and the Language Subtag Reviewer in the registration
	process.</t>

	<t>Modified the rules in <xref target="region"/> so that
	"exceptionally reserved" ISO 3166-1 codes other than 'UK' were
	included into the registry. In particular, this allows the
	code 'EU' (European Union) to be used to form language tags or
	(more commonly) for applications that use the registry for
	region codes to reference this subtag.</t>

	<t>Modified the <xref target="iana">IANA considerations
	section</xref> to remove unnecessary normative
	<xref target="RFC2119"/> language.</t>
