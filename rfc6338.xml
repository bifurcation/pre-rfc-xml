     <t>
       This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN)
       namespace for the Schema for Academia  (SCHAC). 
     </t>
     <t>
       The namespace described in this document is for naming persistent
       resources defined by the SCHAC participants internationally, their
       working groups, and other designated subordinates.  The main use of
       this namespace will be for the creation of controlled vocabulary values
       for attributes in the SCHAC schema.  These values will be associated
       with particular instances of persons or objects belonging to any of
       the SCHAC object classes.

   <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
     <t>
       The Schema for Academia (SCHAC) international activity was born
       inside the Task Force on European Middleware Coordination and
       Collaboration (TF-EMC2) of the Trans-European Research and Education
       Networking Association (TERENA) <xref target="TERENA"/>. The initial
       aim of SCHAC was to harmonize the disjoint person schemas of the
       participating countries in order to have a common way for expressing
       data about persons, exchanged between educational organizations.
       SCHAC, as are other person schemas, is designed to ease the sharing of
       information about a given individual between parties, mostly,
       but not limited to, educational and research institutions. The main
       aims of this sharing are to provide resources to individuals and to
       allow said individuals to move, virtually and physically, between
       such institutions. Thus, the SCHAC schema was defined with input
       from all participants' national person schemas <xref target="SCHAC"/>.
     </t>
     <t>
       SCHAC does not supplant other person schemas such as
       organizationalPerson <xref target="RFC4519"/>,
       inetOrgPerson <xref target="RFC2798"/>, or 
       eduPerson <xref target="EP"/>;
       it extends those where needed for the purposes of
       Higher Education outside the United States.
       This characteristic has made SCHAC, originally
       a European effort, useful for groups outside Europe.

         </t><t hangText="Syntactic structure:">
           <vspace blankLines="1"/>
           The Namespace Specific Strings (NSSs) of all URNs assigned by
           SCHAC will conform to the syntax defined in Section 2.2 of RFC
           2141, "URN Syntax" <xref target="RFC2141"/>.
           In addition, all SCHAC URN NSSs will consist of a left-to-right
           series of tokens delimited by colons. The left-to-right sequence
           of colon-delimited tokens corresponds to descending nodes in
           a tree.  To the right of the lowest naming authority node,
           there may be zero, one, or more levels of hierarchical naming
           nodes terminating in a rightmost leaf node. See the "Identifier
           assignment" section below for more on the semantics
           of NSSs.  This syntax convention is captured in the following
           normative ABNF rules for SCHAC NSSs (see RFC 5234 <xref target="RFC5234"/>):

         </t><t>
           <figure><artwork type='abnf'><![CDATA[
        SCHAC-NSS    =   1*subStChar *( ":" 1*subStChar )

        subStChar    =   trans / "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG

        trans        =   ALPHA / DIGIT / other / reserved

        other        =   "(" / ")" / "+" / "," / "-" / "." /
                         "=" / "@" / ";" / "$" /
                         "_" / "!" / "*" / "'"

        reserved     =   "/" / "?" / "#"]]></artwork></figure>
         </t><t>
           The exclusion of the colon from the list of "other" characters
           means that the colon can only occur as a delimiter between
           string tokens.  Note that this ABNF rule set guarantees that
           any valid SCHAC NSS is also a valid RFC 2141 NSS.

         </t><t hangText="Relevant ancillary documentation:">
           <vspace blankLines="1"/>
           None.

         </t><t hangText="Identifier uniqueness:">
           <vspace blankLines="1"/>
           It is the responsibility of TERENA to guarantee uniqueness of
           the names of immediately subordinate naming authorities.  Each
           lower-level naming authority in turn inherits the
           responsibility of guaranteeing uniqueness of names in its
           branch of the naming tree.

         </t><t hangText="Identifier persistence:">
           <vspace blankLines="1"/>
           TERENA bears ultimate responsibility for maintaining the
           usability of SCHAC URNs over time.  This responsibility MAY be
           delegated to subordinate naming authorities per the discussion
           in the section below on identifier assignment.  That section
           provides a mechanism for the delegation to be revoked in the
           case where a subordinate naming authority ceases to function.

         </t><t hangText="Identifier assignment:">
           <vspace blankLines="1"/>
           TERENA will create an initial series of immediately subordinate
           naming authorities, and will define a process for adding to
           that list of authorities. Such a list, and the policy for adding to
           it, will be published at the root registry page. Each country with
           a representative in SCHAC will be invited to designate a naming
           authority. Country-specific namespaces based on the country Internet
           Top-Level Domain (TLD) <xref target="TLDs"/> will then be
           assigned to the designated
           authority.  The subordinated namespaces int and eu will remain under
           TERENA authority, controlled by the SCHAC activity members,
           for entities of global, international, or European interest.
           There is also the possibility of granting subordinate namespaces
           to multi-country organizations; in this case, the organizational
           Internet Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) will be used as the prefix.
           <vspace blankLines="1"/>
           As an example, a European-level interest entity would be any value
           related to information used in the Higher Education European Space,
           or the so-called Bologna process. Such entities will belong in the
           eu subordinate namespace.
           <vspace blankLines="1"/>
           Global international entities could encompass values related to the
           Grid community or values useful both for some European and for some Australian
           universities. Such entities would belong in the int subordinate
           namespace.
           <vspace blankLines="1"/>
           Examples of multi-country organizations include TERENA itself or an
           association like the Educational Policy Institute (EPI)
           (educationalpolicy.org) that has members from
           Australia, Canada, and the US.
         </t><t>  
           URNs intended for values of SCHAC attributes will include the
           attribute name immediately after the NSS prefix, before any
           geographical namespace delegation, such that any string can
           convey information about the attribute for which it is a value.
           For example, values for schacUserStatus will be of the form:
           <figure><artwork>  
             urn:schac:userStatus:int
             urn:schac:userStatus:au or
             urn:schac:userStatus:terena.org
          </artwork></figure>
         </t>

         <t>  
           If at all possible, automated registry publication
           mechanisms will be provided, based on the work on
           distributed URN registries done by the TF-EMC2 task force members.
         </t><t>  
           Institutions and communities affiliated with SCHAC participants
           may request that they be granted subordinate naming authority
           status. Uniqueness of these namespaces under country 
           authority will be based on the requestor's Internet FQDN.
           This subordination procedure SHOULD be carried along the 
           delegation chain; i.e., if at all possible, all entities
           that receive a delegated namespace MUST have a valid FQDN
           and MUST publish an Internet accessible URN value registry,
           based on the URN
           registry mechanisms designed by the TF-EMC2 task force members.
         </t><t>  
           On at least an annual basis, TERENA will contact the liaisons or
           directors of each immediately subordinate naming authority.  If
           there is no response, or if the respondent indicates that they
           wish to relinquish naming authority, the authority over that
           branch of the tree reverts to TERENA.  This process will be
           enforced recursively by each naming authority on its
           subordinates.  This process guarantees that responsibility for
           each branch of the tree will lapse for less than one year, at
           worst, before being reclaimed by a superior authority.
         </t><t>  
           Lexical equivalence of two SCHAC Namespace Specific Strings
           (NSSs) is defined below as an exact, case-sensitive string
           match.  TERENA will assign names of immediately subordinate
           naming authorities in lowercase only.  This forestalls the
           registration of two SCHAC-subordinate naming authorities whose
           names differ only in case. Attribute names will use the same
           mixed-case format as in the schema definition.

         </t><t hangText="Identifier resolution:">
           <vspace blankLines="1"/>
           The namespace is not currently listed with a Resolution Discovery
           System (RDS), but nothing about the namespace prohibits the future
           definition of appropriate resolution methods or listing with
           an&nbsp;RDS.

         </t><t>  
           TERENA will maintain a registry of all SCHAC-assigned URN values, 
           both final and for delegation, on its web site:
           <vspace blankLines="1"/>
           https://urnreg.terena.org/
           <vspace blankLines="1"/>
           Delegation entries will have a pointer to the registry of the
           subordinate naming authority. This SHOULD recurse down the
           delegation tree, but registries for several delegated namespaces
           MAY be maintained by a single naming authority.

     </t>
   </section>
   <section title="Namespace Considerations">
     <t>
       Registration of a Namespace Identifier (NID) specific to SCHAC is
       reasonable given the following considerations:
     </t>
     <t>
       <list><t>
           SCHAC would like to assign URNs to some very fine-grained
           objects. This does not seem to be the primary intended use of
           the XML.org namespace (RFC 3120) <xref target="RFC3120"/>,
           or the more tightly controlled Organization for the Advancement
           of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) <xref target="OASIS"/>
           namespace (RFC 3121) <xref target="RFC3121"/>.
         </t><t>
           SCHAC seeks naming autonomy. SCHAC is not a member of OASIS,
           so becoming a subordinate naming authority under the
           OASIS URN space is not an option. There is the MACE
           (Middleware Architecture Committee for Education) (RFC 3613)
           <xref target="RFC3613"/> namespace, but the SCHAC development
           is done outside of the MACE activity scope; thus, the attributes
           and values do not belong in the MACE namespace. Using the
           MACE namespace requires that the SCHAC namespace be placed
           under one of the SCHAC participants' namespaces, which hinders
           its global scope.
         </t><t>
           SCHAC will want to assign URNs to non-XML objects as well.
           That is another reason that XML.org may not be an appropriate
           higher-level naming authority for SCHAC.
         </t></list>
     </t>
     <t>
       Some of the already defined SCHAC attribute values have been assigned 
       URNs under the urn:mace:terena.org namespace. These values will enter a 
       deprecation cycle, with a clear indication that they will be replaced by
       values under the new namespace once it is assigned. In any case,
       RFC 3406 <xref target="RFC3406"/> (which replaced RFC 2611) includes
       an explicit statement that two or more URNs may point to the same
       resource.
     </t>
   </section>
   <section title="Community Considerations">
     <t>
       The assignment and use of identifiers within the namespace are open,
       and the related rule is established by the SCHAC activity members.
       Registration agencies (the next-level naming authorities) will be the 
       National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) and established
       organizational cross-border organizations that participate in SCHAC.
     </t>
     <t>
       It is expected that the majority of the European NRENs,
       their constituencies, participants in the Australian
       Access Federation, and some other international
       activities will make use of the SCHAC namespace.
     </t>
     <t>
       After the establishment of the SCHAC namespace, TERENA will
       establish a registry service (analogously to other distributed
       pan-European services, such as eduroam, PerfSONAR, etc.) for the
       namespace clients. This registry will be available via the
       root page of the namespace: 
       https://urnreg.terena.org/. The policy for registrations will be
       defined in documents available at the root page of the registry.

       overall document quality, for which we herein thank him.
       We'd also like to
       thank Chris Lonvick for helping us express our security concerns in a
       better way. Finally, we thank other reviewers that have helped us to
       give the final touches to the text.
