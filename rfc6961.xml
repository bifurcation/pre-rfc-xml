      <t>This document defines the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Certificate
      Status Version 2 Extension to allow clients to specify and support
      several certificate status methods. (The use of the Certificate Status
      extension is commonly referred to as "OCSP stapling".) Also defined is a
      new method based on the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) that
      servers can use to provide status information about not only the
      server's own certificate but also the status of intermediate
      certificates in the chain.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extension <xref target="RFC6066"/>
      framework defines, among other extensions, the Certificate Status
      extension (also referred to as "OCSP stapling") that clients can use to
      request the server's copy of the current status of its certificate. The
      benefits of this extension include a reduced number of roundtrips and
      network delays for the client to verify the status of the server's
      certificate and a reduced load on the certificate issuer's status
      response servers, thus solving a problem that can become significant
      when the issued certificate is presented by a frequently visited
      server.</t>

      <t>There are two problems with the existing Certificate Status
      extension. First, it does not provide functionality to request the
      status information about intermediate Certification Authority (CA)
      certificates, which means the client has to request status information
      through other methods, such as Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs),
      introducing further delays. Second, the current format of the extension
      and requirements in the TLS protocol prevent a client from offering the
      server multiple status methods.</t>

      <t>Many CAs are now issuing intermediate CA certificates that not only
      specify the publication point for their CRLs in a CRL Distribution Point
      <xref target="RFC5280"/> but also specify a URL for their
      OCSP <xref target="RFC6960"/> server in
      Authority Information Access <xref target="RFC5280"/>. Given that
      client-cached CRLs are
      frequently out of date, clients would benefit from using OCSP to access
      up-to-date status information about intermediate CA certificates. The
      benefit to the issuing CA is less clear, as providing the bandwidth for
      the OCSP responder can be costly, especially for CAs with many
      high-traffic subscriber sites, and this cost is a concern for many CAs.
      There are cases where OCSP requests for a single high-traffic site
      caused significant network problems for the issuing CA.</t>

      <t>Clients will benefit from the TLS server providing certificate status
      information regardless of type, not just for the server certificate but
      also for the intermediate CA certificates. Combining the status checks
      into one extension will reduce the roundtrips needed to complete the
      handshake by the client to just those needed for negotiating the TLS
      connection. Also, for the Certification Authorities, the load on their
      servers will depend on the number of certificates they have issued, not
      on the number of visitors to those sites. Additionally, using this
      extension significantly reduces privacy concerns around the clients
      informing the certificate issuer about which sites they are
      visiting.</t>

      <t>For such a new system to be introduced seamlessly, clients need to be
      able to indicate support for the existing OCSP Certificate Status
      method and a new multiple-OCSP mode.</t>

      <t>Unfortunately, the definition of the Certificate Status extension
      only allows a single Certificate Status extension to be defined in a
      single extension record in the handshake, and the TLS protocol <xref
      target="RFC5246"/> only allows a single record in the extension list for
      any given extension. This means that it is not possible for clients to
      indicate support for new methods while still supporting older methods,
      which would cause problems for interoperability between newer clients
      and older servers. This will not just be an issue for the multiple
      status request mode proposed above but also for any other future status
      methods that might be introduced. This will be true not just for the
      current PKIX infrastructure <xref target="RFC5280"/> but also for
      alternative PKI structures.</t>

      <t>The solution to this problem is to define a new extension,
      "status_request_v2", with an extended format that allows the client to
      indicate support for multiple status request methods. This is
      implemented using a list of CertificateStatusRequestItemV2 records in
      the extension record. As the server will select the single status method
      based on the selected cipher suite and the certificate presented, no
      significant changes are needed in the server's extension format.</t>

      <section anchor="NewExtension" title="New Extension">
        <t>The extension defined by this document is indicated by
        "status_request_v2" in the ExtensionType enum (originally defined by
        <xref target="RFC6066"/>), which uses the following value:</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
  enum {

      <section anchor="MultiRecord"
               title="Multiple Certificate Status Request Record">
        <t>Clients that support a certificate status protocol like OCSP may
        send the "status_request_v2" extension to the server in order to use
        the TLS handshake to transfer such data instead of downloading it
        through separate connections. When using this extension, the
        "extension_data" field (defined in Section 7.4.1.4 of
        <xref target="RFC5246"/>) of the extension SHALL contain a
        CertificateStatusRequestListV2 where:</t>

        <figure> <artwork><![CDATA[ 
  struct {
    CertificateStatusType status_type;
    uint16 request_length; /* Length of request field in bytes */
    select (status_type) {
      case ocsp: OCSPStatusRequest;
      case ocsp_multi: OCSPStatusRequest;
    } request;
  } CertificateStatusRequestItemV2;

  enum { ocsp(1), ocsp_multi(2), (255) } CertificateStatusType;

  struct {
    ResponderID responder_id_list<0..2^16-1>;
    Extensions request_extensions;
  } OCSPStatusRequest;

  opaque ResponderID<1..2^16-1>;
  opaque Extensions<0..2^16-1>;

  struct {
    CertificateStatusRequestItemV2
                     certificate_status_req_list<1..2^16-1>;
  } CertificateStatusRequestListV2;
]]></artwork> </figure>

        <t>In the OCSPStatusRequest (originally defined by <xref
        target="RFC6066"/>), the "ResponderID" provides a list of OCSP
        responders that the client trusts. A zero-length "responder_id_list"
        sequence has the special meaning that the responders are implicitly
        known to the server, e.g., by prior arrangement, or are identified by
        the certificates used by the server. "Extensions" is a DER encoding
        <xref target="X.690"/> of the OCSP request extensions, and
        if the server supports the forwarding of OCSP request extensions, this
        value MUST be forwarded without modification.</t>

        <t>Both "ResponderID" and "Extensions" are DER-encoded ASN.1 types as
        defined in <xref target="RFC6960"/>. "Extensions" is
        imported from <xref target="RFC5280"/>. A zero-length
        "request_extensions" value means that there are no extensions (as
        opposed to a DER-encoded zero-length ASN.1 SEQUENCE, which is not
        valid for the "Extensions" type).</t>

        <t>Servers that support a client's selection of responders using the
        ResponderID field could implement this selection by matching the
        responder ID values from the client's list with the ResponderIDs of
        known OCSP responders, either by using a binary compare of the values
        or a hash calculation and compare method.</t>

        <t>In the case of the "id-pkix-ocsp-nonce" OCSP extension, <xref
        target="RFC2560"/> is unclear about its encoding; for clarification,
        the nonce MUST be a DER-encoded OCTET STRING, which is encapsulated as
        another OCTET STRING (note that implementations based on an existing
        OCSP client will need to be checked for conformance to this
        requirement). This has been clarified in <xref target="RFC6960"/>.</t>

        <t>The items in the list of CertificateStatusRequestItemV2 entries are
        ordered according to the client's preference (favorite choice
        first).</t>

        <t>A server that receives a client hello containing the
        "status_request_v2" extension MAY return a suitable certificate status
        response message to the client along with the server's certificate
        message. If OCSP is requested, it SHOULD use the information contained
        in the extension when selecting an OCSP responder and SHOULD include
        request_extensions in the OCSP request.</t>

        <t>The server returns a certificate status response along with its
        certificate by sending a "CertificateStatus" message (originally
        defined by <xref target="RFC6066"/>) immediately after the
        "Certificate" message (Section 7.4.2 of <xref target="RFC5246"/>)
        (and before any "ServerKeyExchange" or "CertificateRequest" messages).
        If a server returns a "CertificateStatus" message in response to a
        "status_request_v2" request, then the server MUST have included an
        extension of type "status_request_v2" with empty "extension_data" in
        the extended server hello.</t>

        <t> The "CertificateStatus" message is conveyed
        using the handshake message type "certificate_status" (defined in
        <xref target="RFC6066"/>) as follows (updated from the definition in
        <xref target="RFC6066"/>):</t>

        <figure> <artwork><![CDATA[
  struct {
    CertificateStatusType status_type;
    select (status_type) {
      case ocsp: OCSPResponse;
      case ocsp_multi: OCSPResponseList;
    } response;
  } CertificateStatus;

  opaque OCSPResponse<0..2^24-1>;

  struct {
    OCSPResponse ocsp_response_list<1..2^24-1>;
  } OCSPResponseList;
]]></artwork> </figure>

        <t>An "OCSPResponse" element (originally defined by <xref
        target="RFC6066"/>) contains a complete, DER-encoded OCSP response
        (using the ASN.1 <xref target="X.680"/> type OCSPResponse
        defined in <xref target="RFC6960"/>). Only one OCSP
        response, with a length of at least one byte, may be sent for
        status_type "ocsp".</t>

        <t>An "ocsp_response_list" contains a list of "OCSPResponse" elements,
        as specified above, each containing the OCSP response for the matching
        corresponding certificate in the server's Certificate TLS handshake
        message. That is, the first entry is the OCSP response for the first
        certificate in the Certificate list, the second entry is the response
        for the second certificate, and so on. The list MAY contain fewer OCSP
        responses than there were certificates in the Certificate handshake
        message, but there MUST NOT be more responses than there were
        certificates in the list. Individual elements of the list MAY have a
        length of 0 (zero) bytes if the server does not have the OCSP
        response for that particular certificate stored, in which case the
        client MUST act as if a response was not received for that particular
        certificate. If the client receives a "ocsp_response_list" that does
        not contain a response for one or more of the certificates in the
        completed certificate chain, the client SHOULD attempt to validate the
        certificate using an alternative retrieval method, such as downloading
        the relevant CRL; OCSP SHOULD in this situation only be used for the
        end-entity certificate, not intermediate CA certificates, for reasons
        stated above.</t>

        <t>Note that a server MAY also choose not to send a
        "CertificateStatus" message, even if it has received a
        "status_request_v2" extension in the client hello message and has sent
        a "status_request_v2" extension in the server hello message.
        Additionally, note that a server MUST NOT send the
        "CertificateStatus" message unless it received either a
        "status_request" or "status_request_v2" extension in the client hello
        message and sent a corresponding "status_request" or
        "status_request_v2" extension in the server hello message.</t>

        <t>Clients requesting an OCSP response and receiving one or more OCSP
        responses in a "CertificateStatus" message MUST check the OCSP
        response(s) and abort the handshake if the response is a "revoked"
        status or other unacceptable responses (as determined by client
        policy) with a bad_certificate_status_response(113) alert. This alert
        is always fatal.</t>

        <t>If the OCSP response received from the server does not result in a
        definite "good" or "revoked" status, it is inconclusive. A TLS client
        in such a case MAY check the validity of the server certificate
        through other means, e.g., by directly querying the certificate
        issuer. If such processing still results in an inconclusive response,
        then the application using the TLS connection will have to decide
        whether to close the connection or not. Note that this problem cannot
        be decided by the generic TLS client code without information from the
        application. If the application doesn't provide any such information,
        then the client MUST abort the connection, since the server certificate
        has not been sufficiently validated.</t>

        <t>An example of where the application might wish to continue is with
        EAP-TLS (Extensible Authentication Protocol - TLS), where the
        application can use another mechanism to check the
        status of a certificate once it obtains network access. In this case,
        the application could have the client continue with the handshake, but
        it MUST NOT disclose a username and password until it has fully
        validated the server certificate.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>General security considerations for TLS extensions are covered in
      <xref target="RFC5246"/>. Security considerations for the particular
      extension specified in this document are given below. In general,
      implementers should continue to monitor the state of the art and address
      any weaknesses identified.</t>

      <section title="Security Considerations for status_request_v2">
        <t>If a client requests an OCSP response, it must take into account
        that an attacker's server using a compromised key could (and probably
        would) pretend not to support the extension. In this case, a client
        that requires OCSP validation of certificates SHOULD either contact
        the OCSP server directly or abort the handshake.</t>

        <t>Use of the OCSP nonce request extension (id-pkix-ocsp-nonce) may
        improve security against attacks that attempt to replay OCSP
        responses; see Section 4.4.1 of <xref target="RFC6960"/> for
        further details.</t>

        <t>This extension allows the client to send arbitrary data to the
        server. The server implementers need to handle such data carefully to
        avoid introducing security vulnerabilities.</t>

        <t>The security considerations of <xref target="RFC6960"/> apply
        to OCSP requests and responses.</t>
