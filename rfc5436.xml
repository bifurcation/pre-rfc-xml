              The <xref target="Notify"/> extension to the <xref target="Sieve"/>
              mail filtering language is a framework for providing notifications
              by employing URIs to specify the notification mechanism.
              This document defines how <xref target="mailto"/> URIs are
              used to generate notifications by email.

            The mailto mechanism results in the sending of a new email message
            (a "notification message") to notify a recipient about a "triggering message".
          </t>
          
          <section anchor="tag-method" title='Notify Parameter "method"'>
            <t>
              The mailto notification mechanism uses standard mailto URIs
              as specified in <xref target="mailto"/>.
              mailto URIs may contain header fields
              consisting of a header name and value.  These header fields are
              called "URI headers" to distinguish them from "message headers".              
            </t>
          </section>
          
          <section anchor="tag-test" title='Test notify_method_capability'>
            <t>
              The notify_method_capability test for "online" may return "yes" or "no"
              only if the Sieve processor can determine with certainty whether or
              not the recipients of the notification message are online and logged in.
              Otherwise, the test returns "maybe" for this notification method.
            </t>
          </section>
          
          <section anchor="tag-from" title='Notify Tag ":from"'>
            <t>
              The ":from" tag overrides the default sender of
              the notification message.  "Sender", here, refers to the value
              used in the <xref target="RFC5322"/> "From" header.  Implementations
              MAY also use this value in the <xref target="RFC5321"/> "MAIL FROM"
              command (the "envelope sender"), or they may prefer to establish a mailbox that receives
              bounces from notification messages.
            </t>
          </section>
          
          <section anchor="tag-importance" title='Notify Tag ":importance"'>
            <t>
              The ":importance" tag has no special meaning for this notification mechanism,
              and this specification puts no restriction on its use.
              Implementations MAY use the value of ":importance" to set a
              priority or importance indication on the notification message (perhaps
              a visual indication, or perhaps making use of one of the non-standard
              but commonly used message headers).
            </t>
          </section>
          
          <section anchor="tag-options" title='Notify Tag ":options"'>
            <t>
              This tag is not used by the mailto method.
            </t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="tag-message" title='Notify Tag ":message"'>
            <t>
              The value of this tag, if it is present, is used as the subject of the notification
              message, and overrides all other mechanisms for determining the subject (as described below).
              Its value SHOULD NOT normally be truncated, though it may be sensible
              to truncate an excessively long value.
            </t>

          <section anchor="otherdef" title="Other Definitions">
            <t>
              Because the receipt of an email message is generating another
              email message, implementations MUST take steps to avoid mail loops.
              The REQUIRED inclusion of an "Auto-Submitted:" field,
              as described in the message composition guidelines, will also help
              in loop detection and avoidance.
            </t>
            <t>
              Implementations SHOULD NOT trigger notifications for messages containing
              "Auto-Submitted:" header fields with any value other than "No".
            </t>
            <t>
              Implementations MUST allow messages with empty envelope
              senders to trigger notifications.
            </t>
            <t>
              Because this notification method uses a store-and-forward system
              for delivery of the notification message, the Sieve processor should not
              have a need to retry notifications.  Therefore, implementations of this method SHOULD
              use normal mechanisms for submitting SMTP messages and for retrying
              the initial submission.  Once the notification message is submitted, implementations
              MUST NOT resubmit it, as this is likely to result in multiple notifications, and
              increases the danger of message loops.
            </t>
            <t>
              Implementations SHOULD consider limiting notification messages.  In particular,
              they SHOULD NOT sent duplicate notifications to the same address
         from the same script invocation.
              Batching of notifications within a short time to the same address might also be
              useful.  Different implementations, different administrative domains, and different
              users may have different needs; configuration options are a good idea here.
            </t>
            <t>
            </t>
            <t>
              The overall notification message is composed using the following
              guidelines (see <xref target="RFC5322"/> for references to message header fields):
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>
                  If the envelope sender of the triggering message is
                  empty, the envelope sender of the notification
                  message MUST be empty as well, to avoid message loops.
				  Otherwise, the envelope sender of the notification
				  message SHOULD be set to the value of the ":from" tag
				  to the notify action, if one is specified, has email address
				  syntax, and is valid according to the implementation-specific
				  security checks (see Section 3.3 of <xref target="Notify"/>).
				  If ":from" is not specified or is not valid,
				  the envelope sender of the notification
				  message SHOULD be set either to the envelope "to" field from the triggering
				  message, as used by Sieve, or to an email address associated with
                  the notification system, at the
                  discretion of the implementation.  This MUST NOT be overridden
                  by a "from" URI header, and any such URI header MUST be ignored.
                </t>
                <t>
                  The envelope recipient(s) of the notification message SHOULD be set to the
                  address(es) specified in the URI (including any URI headers where the hname
                  is "to" or "cc").
                </t>
                <t>
                  The header field "Auto-Submitted: auto-notified" MUST be included in
                  the notification message (see <xref target="autosubmit"/>).  This is to
                  reduce the likelihood of message loops, by tagging this as an automatically
                  generated message.  Among other results, it will inform other notification
                  systems not to generate further notifications.  mailto URI headers with
                  hname "auto-submitted" are considered unsafe and MUST be ignored.
                </t>
                <t>
				  The "From:" header field of the notification message
				  SHOULD be set to the value of the ":from" tag
				  to the notify action, if one is specified, has email address
				  syntax, and is valid according to the implementation-specific
				  security checks (see Section 3.3 of <xref target="Notify"/>).
				  If ":from" is not specified or is not valid,
				  the "From:" header field of the notification
				  message SHOULD be set either to the envelope "to" field from the triggering
				  message, as used by Sieve, or to an email address associated
                  with the notification system, at the
                  discretion of the implementation.  This MUST NOT be overridden
                  by a "from" URI header, and any such URI header MUST be ignored.
                </t>
                <t>
                  The "To:" header field of the notification message
                  SHOULD be set to the address(es) specified in the URI (including any URI headers
                  where the hname is "to").
                </t>
                <t>
                  The "Subject:" field of the notification message SHOULD contain the
                  value defined by the ":message" tag, as described in <xref target="Notify"/>.
                  If there is no ":message" tag and there is a "subject" header on the
                  URI, then that value SHOULD be used.  If the
                  "subject" header is also absent,
                  the subject SHOULD be retained from the triggering
                  message.
                  Note that Sieve <xref target="Variables"/> can be used to advantage here, as shown
                  in the example in <xref target="examples"/>.
                </t>
                <t>
                  The "References:" field of the notification message MAY be set to refer to 
                  the triggering message, and MAY include references from the triggering message.
                </t>
                <t>
                  If the mailto URI contains a "body" header, the value of
                  that header SHOULD be used as the body of the notification message.
                  If there is no "body" header, it is up to the implementation
                  whether to leave the body empty or to use an excerpt of the original
                  message.
                </t>
                <t>
                  The "Received:" fields from the triggering message MAY be retained
                  in the notification message, as these could provide useful trace/history/diagnostic
                  information.  The "Auto-Submitted" header field MUST be placed above
                  these (see <xref target="autosubmit"/>).
                  URI headers with hname "received" are considered unsafe, and MUST be ignored.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Other header fields of the notification message that are normally related to
                  an individual new message (such as "Message-ID" and "Date") are generated
                  for the notification message in the normal manner, and MUST NOT be copied
                  from the triggering message.  Any URI headers with
                  those names MUST be ignored.  Further, the "Date" header serves as the
                  notification timestamp defined in <xref target="Notify"/>.
                </t>
                <t>
                  All other header fields of the notification message either are as
                  specified by URI headers, or have implementation-specific values;
                  their values are not defined here.  It is suggested that the
                  implementation capitalize the first letter of URI headers
                  and add a space character after the colon between the
                  mail header name and value when adding URI headers to the
                  message, to be consistent with common practice in email headers.
                </t>
              </list>
            </t>
          
            <section anchor="autosubmit" title="The Auto-Submitted Header Field">
                <t>
                  The header field "Auto-Submitted: auto-notified" MUST be included in
                  the notification message (see <xref target="RFC3834"/>).
                  The "Auto-Submitted" header field is considered a "trace field", similar to
                  "Received" header fields (see <xref target="RFC5321"/>).  If the implementation
                  retains the "Received" fields from the triggering message (see above), the
                  "Auto-Submitted" field MUST be placed above those "Received" fields, serving as
                  a boundary between the ones from the triggering message and those that will be part
                  of the notification message.
                </t>
                <t>
                  The header field "Auto-Submitted: auto-notified" MUST include one or both of

                  <list style="symbols">
                    <t>
                      owner-email - specifies an email address, determined by the implementation,
                      of the owner of the Sieve script
                      that generated this notification.  If specified, it might be used to identify
                      or contact the script's owner.
                      The parameter attribute is "owner-email", and
                      the parameter value is a quoted string containing an email address, as defined
                      by "addr-spec" in <xref target="RFC5322"/>.
                      Example:
                      <vspace/>
                      <vspace/>

                    <t>
                      owner-token - specifies an opaque token, determined by the implementation,
                      that the administrative domain of the owner of the Sieve script that generated
                      this notification can use to identify
                      the owner.  This might be used to allow identification of the owner
                      while protecting the owner's privacy.
                      The parameter attribute is "owner-token", and
                      the parameter value is as defined by "token" in <xref target="RFC3834"/>.
                      Example:

                "mail.example.org" received line to recognize that.
                The Auto-Submitted header field is also present to tell
                the server to avoid sending another notification, and
                it includes an optional owner-email parameter for identification.

        <section anchor="i18n" title="Internationalization Considerations">
          <t>
            This specification introduces no specific internationalization
            issues that are not already addressed
            in <xref target="Sieve"/>
            and in <xref target="Notify"/>.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
          <t>
            Sending a notification is comparable with forwarding mail to the
            notification recipient.  Care must be taken when forwarding mail
            automatically, to ensure that confidential information is not sent
            into an insecure environment.
          </t>
          <t>
            The automated sending of email messages exposes the system to
            mail loops, which can cause operational problems.  Implementations
            of this specification MUST protect themselves against mail loops; see <xref target="otherdef"/>
            for discussion of this and some suggestions.  Other possible mitigations for mail loops
            involve types of service limitations.  For example, the number of notifications generated
            for a single user might be limited to no more than, say, 30 in a 60&nbhy;minute period.
            Of course, this technique presents its own problems, in that the actual rate-limit must
            be selected carefully, to allow most legitimate situations in the given environment.
            Even with careful selection, it's inevitable that there will be false positives -- and
            false negatives.
          </t>
          <t>
            Ultimately, human intervention may be necessary to re-enable notifications that have been
            disabled because a loop was detected, or to terminate a very slow loop that's under the
            automatic-detection radar.  Administrative mechanisms MUST be available to handle these
            sorts of situations.
          </t>
          <t>
            Email addresses specified as recipients of notifications might not be owned by the
            entity that owns the Sieve script.  As a result, a notification recipient could wind up
            as the target of unwanted notifications, either through intent (using scripts to mount
            a mail-bomb attack) or by accident (an address was mistyped or has been reassigned).
            The situation is arguably no worse than any other in which a recipient gets unwanted
            email, and some of the same mechanisms can be used in this case.  But those deploying
            this extension have to be aware of the potential extra problems here, where scripts
            might be created through means that do not adequately validate email addresses, and such
            scripts might then be forgotten and left to run indefinitely.
          </t>
          <t>
            In particular, note that the Auto-Submitted header field is required to include a
            value that a recipient can use when contacting the source domain of the notification
            message (see <xref target="autosubmit"/>).  That value will allow the domain to track
            down the script's owner and have the script corrected or disabled.  Domains that enable
            this extension MUST be prepared to respond to such complaints, in order to limit the
            damage caused by a faulty script.
          </t>
          <t>
            Problems can also show up if notification messages are sent to a gateway into another
            service, such as SMS.  Information from the email message is often lost in the gateway
            translation; and in this case, critical information needed to avoid loops, to contact the
            script owner, and to resolve other problems might be lost.  Developers of email gateways
            should consider these issues, and try to preserve as much information as possible,
            including what appears in email trace headers and the
            Auto-Submitted header field.
          </t>
