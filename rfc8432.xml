   <t>The unification of control and management of microwave radio link
   interfaces is a precondition for seamless multi-layer networking and automated network provisioning and operation.</t>
   
   <t>This document describes the required characteristics and use cases for control and management of radio link interface parameters using a YANG data model.</t>


   <t>The purpose is to create a framework to identify the necessary
   information elements and define a YANG data model for control and
   management of the radio link interfaces in a microwave node. Some parts of
   the resulting model may be generic and could also be used by other
   technologies, e.g., Ethernet technology.</t>

  <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
   <t>Microwave radio is a technology that uses high-frequency radio waves to provide high-speed wireless connections that can send and receive voice, video, and data information. It is a general term used for systems covering a very large range of traffic capacities, channel separations, modulation formats, and applications over a wide range of frequency bands from 1.4 GHz up to and above 100 GHz.</t>

   <t>The main application for microwave is backhaul for mobile
   broadband. Those networks will continue to be modernized using a
   combination of microwave and fiber technologies. 
   The choice of technology
   depends on fiber presence and cost of ownership, not capacity limitations
   in microwave.</t>

   <t>Today, microwave is already able to fully support the capacity needs of a
   backhaul in a radio access network and will evolve to support multiple
   gigabits in traditional frequency bands and more than 10 gigabits in
   higher-frequency bands with more bandwidth. Layer 2 (L2) Ethernet features are
   normally an integrated part of microwave nodes, and more advanced L2 and
   Layer 3 (L3) features will be introduced over time to support the evolution of the
   transport services that will be provided by a backhaul/transport network.


 Note that wireless access technologies such as 3/4/5G and Wi-Fi are not
   within the scope of this document.</t>


   <t>Open and standardized interfaces are a prerequisite for efficient
   management of equipment from multiple vendors, integrated in a
   single system/controller. This framework addresses management and control
   of the radio link interface(s) and their relationship to other interfaces
   (typically, Ethernet interfaces) in a microwave node. A radio link provides
   the transport over the air, using one or several carriers in aggregated or
   protected configurations. Managing and controlling a transport service over
   a microwave node involves both radio link and packet transport functionality.</t>

   <t>Today, there are already numerous IETF data models, RFCs, and
   Internet-Drafts with technology-specific extensions that cover a large part
   of the L2 and L3 domains. Examples include IP Management <xref target="RFC8344"
   pageno="false" format="default" />, Routing Management <xref
   target="RFC8349" pageno="false" format="default" />, and Provider Bridge
   <xref target="IEEE802.1Qcp" />. These are based
   on the IETF YANG data model for Interface Management <xref target="RFC8343"
   pageno="false" format="default" />, which is an evolution of the SNMP
   IF-MIB <xref target="RFC2863" pageno="false" format="default" />.</t>


   <t>Since microwave nodes will contain more and more L2 and L3 (packet)
   functionality that is expected to be managed using those models, there are
   advantages if radio link interfaces can be modeled and managed using the
   same structure and the same approach. 


This is especially true for use cases
   in which a microwave node is managed as one common entity that includes both
   the radio link and the L2 and L3 functionality, e.g., basic
   configuration of the node and connections, centralized troubleshooting,
   upgrade, and maintenance. All interfaces in a node, irrespective of
   technology, would then be accessed from the same core model, i.e., <xref
   target="RFC8343" pageno="false" format="default" />, and could be extended
   with technology-specific parameters in models augmenting that core
   model. The relationship/connectivity between interfaces could be given by
   the physical equipment configuration. For example, the slot where the Radio Link Terminal (modem) is plugged in could be associated with a specific Ethernet port due to the wiring in the backplane of the system, or it could be flexible and therefore configured via a management system or controller.</t>

   <t>There will always be certain implementations that differ among products, so
   it is 
   practically impossible to achieve industry consensus on
   every design detail. It is therefore important to focus on the parameters
   that are required to support the use cases applicable for centralized,
   unified, multi-vendor management and to allow other parameters to either be 
   optional or be covered by extensions to the standardized model. Furthermore, a
   standard that allows for a certain degree of freedom encourages innovation
   and competition, which benefits the entire industry. Thus, it is
   important that a radio link management model covers all relevant functions
   but also leaves room for  product- and feature-specific extensions.</t>


  
   <t>Models are available for microwave radio link functionality:
    "Microwave Information Model" by the ONF <xref
   target="ONF-MW" pageno="false" format="default" /> 
and "Microwave Radio Link YANG Data Models" submitted to and discussed by
the CCAMP Working Group
   <xref
   target="CCAMP-MW" />. 


The purpose of this
   document is to reach consensus within the industry around one common approach
   with respect to the use cases and requirements to be supported, the type
   and structure of the model, and the resulting attributes to be
   included. 


This document describes the use cases, requirements,
   and expected characteristics of the model. 
  It also
  includes an analysis of how the models in the two ongoing initiatives
  fulfill these expectations and recommendations for what can be reused
  and what gaps need to be filled by a new and evolved model ("A YANG Data Model
  for Microwave Radio Link" by the IETF <xref target="IETF-MW"/>).

  <section anchor="Approaches" title="Approaches to Manage and Control Radio Link Interfaces" toc="default">
   <t>This framework addresses the definition of an open and standardized
   interface for radio link functionality in a microwave node. The
   application of such an interface used for management and control of nodes
   and networks typically varies from one operator to another in terms of the
   systems used and how they interact. Possible approaches include using a
   Network Management System (NMS), Software-Defined Networking (SDN), or some
   combination of the two. As there are still many networks where the NMS is implemented as one component/interface and the SDN controller is scoped to control-plane functionality as a separate component/interface, this document does not preclude either model. The aim of this document is to provide a framework for development of a common YANG data model for both management and control of microwave interfaces.</t>
   
   <section anchor="Network" title="Network Management Solutions" toc="default">
    <t>The classic network management solutions, with vendor-specific domain
    management combined with cross-domain functionality for service management
    and analytics, still dominate the market. These solutions are expected to
    evolve and benefit from an increased focus on standardization by
    simplifying multi-vendor management and removing the need for vendor- or domain-specific management.</t>
   </section>

  
   <section anchor="Software" title="Software-Defined Networking" toc="default">
    <t>One of the main drivers for applying SDN from an operator perspective is simplification and automation of network provisioning as well as end-to-end network service management. The vision is to have a global view of the network conditions spanning different vendors' equipment and multiple technologies.</t>


    <t>If nodes from different vendors are managed by the same SDN controller
    via a node management interface without the
    extra effort of introducing intermediate systems, all nodes must align
    their node management interfaces. Hence, an open and standardized node
    management interface is required in a multi-vendor environment. Such a
    standardized interface enables unified management and configuration of
    nodes from different vendors by a common set of applications.</t>
   
    <t>In addition to SDN applications for configuring, managing, and
    controlling the nodes and their associated transport interfaces (including
    the L2 Ethernet, L3 IP, and radio interfaces), there are also a large variety of more advanced SDN applications that can be utilized and/or developed.</t>


    <t>A potentially flexible approach for operators is to use SDN in a
    logically controlled way, managing the radio links by selecting a predefined
    operation mode. The operation mode is a set of logical metrics or
    parameters describing a complete radio link configuration, such as capacity, availability, priority, and power consumption.</t>
   
    <t>An example of an operation mode table is shown in <xref target="figure_ex2" pageno="false" format="default" />. Based on its operation policy (e.g., power consumption or traffic priority), the SDN controller selects one operation mode and translates that into the required configuration of the individual parameters for the Radio Link Terminals and the associated Carrier Terminations.</t>

  <section anchor="Requirements" title="Requirements" toc="default">

   <t>For managing a microwave node including both the radio link and the
   packet transport functionality, a unified data model is desired to unify
   the modeling of the radio link interfaces and the L2/L3 interfaces using
   the same structure and the same modeling approach. If some part of the model is generic for other technology usage, it should be clearly stated.</t>

   <t>The purpose of the YANG data model is for management and control of the radio link interface(s) and the relationship/connectivity to other interfaces, typically to Ethernet interfaces, in a
   microwave node.</t>

   <t>The capability of configuring and managing microwave nodes includes the following requirements for the model:
    <list style="numbers">
     <t>It MUST be possible to configure, manage, and control a Radio Link Terminal and the constituent Carrier Terminations.
      <list style="letters">
	   <t>Configuration of frequency, channel bandwidth, modulation, coding, and transmitter output power MUST be supported for a Carrier Termination.</t>
	   
	   <t>A Radio Link Terminal MUST configure the associated Carrier
	   Terminations and the type of aggregation/bonding or protection
	   configurations expected for the Radio Link Terminal.</t>

	   
	   <t>The capability (e.g., the maximum modulation supported) and the actual status/statistics (e.g., administrative status of the carriers) SHOULD also be supported by the data model.</t>
	   
	   <t>The definition of the features and parameters SHOULD be based on
	   established microwave equipment and radio standards, such as ETSI
	   EN 302 217 <xref target="EN302217-2" pageno="false"
	   format="default" />, which specifies the essential parameters for
	   microwave systems operating from 1.4 GHz to 86 GHz.</t>
	  </list>
	 </t>

	 <t>It MUST be possible to map different traffic types (e.g., TDM and Ethernet) to the transport capacity provided by a specific Radio Link Terminal.</t>

	 
	 <t>
It MUST be possible to configure and collect historical
       measurements (for the use case described in <xref target="Performance"/>) to be
       performed on a radio link interface (e.g., minimum, maximum, 
       average transmit power, and received level in dBm).
</t>


	 
	 <t>
It MUST be possible to configure and retrieve alarms reporting
       associated with the radio interfaces (e.g., configuration fault, signal
       lost, modem fault, and radio fault).

</t>
    </list>

  <section anchor="Gap" title="Gap Analysis on Models" toc="default">
   <t>The purpose of the gap analysis is to identify and recommend
   what models to use in a microwave device to support the use cases and
   requirements specified in the previous sections. This document also makes a
   recommendation for how the gaps not supported should be filled, including the need for development of new models and evolution of existing models and documents.</t>
   
   <t>Models are available for microwave radio link functionality:
    "Microwave Information Model" by the ONF <xref
   target="ONF-MW" pageno="false" format="default" /> 
and "Microwave Radio Link YANG Data Models" submitted to and discussed by
the CCAMP Working Group
   <xref
   target="CCAMP-MW" />. 


The analysis in this document takes these initiatives into consideration and
   makes a recommendation on how to use and complement them in
   order to fill the gaps identified.</t>
   
   <t>For generic functionality, not functionality specific to radio link, the
   ambition is to refer to existing or emerging models that could be
   applicable for all functional areas in a microwave node.</t>

   <section anchor="Microwave" title="Microwave Radio Link Functionality" toc="default">
    <t><xref target="ONF-CIM" pageno="false" format="default" /> defines a
    CoreModel of the ONF Common Information Model. An information model
    describes the things in a domain in terms of objects, their properties
    (represented as attributes), and their relationships. The ONF information
    model is expressed in Unified Modeling Language (UML). The ONF CoreModel
    is independent of specific data-plane technology. 

The technology-specific content, acquired in a runtime solution via "filled
    in" cases of specification, augments the CoreModel by providing a
    forwarding technology-specific representation.</t>


    <t>IETF data models define implementations and protocol-specific
    details. YANG is a data modeling language used to model the configuration
    and state data. <xref target="RFC8343" pageno="false" format="default" />
    defines a generic YANG data model for interface management that doesn't
    include technology-specific information. To describe the
    technology-specific information, several YANG data
    models have been proposed in the IETF to augment <xref target="RFC8343" pageno="false"
    format="default" />, e.g., the data model defined in <xref target="RFC8344" pageno="false"
    format="default" />. 


The YANG data model is a popular approach for
    modeling interfaces for many packet transport technologies and is thereby
    well positioned to become an industry standard. 

In light of this trend,
    <xref target="CCAMP-MW" /> 
  provides a YANG data model proposal for radio interfaces that is well
  aligned with the structure of other technology-specific YANG data
  models augmenting 
    <xref target="RFC8343" pageno="false" format="default" />.

</t>
   
    <t><xref target="RFC3444" pageno="false" format="default" /> explains the
    difference between Information Models (IMs) and Data Models
    (DMs). An IM models managed objects at a
    conceptual level for designers and operators, while a DM is defined at a lower level and includes many
    details for implementers. In addition, the protocol-specific details are
    usually included in a DM. Since conceptual models can be implemented in different ways, multiple DMs can be derived from a single IM. </t>
   
    <t>It is recommended to use the structure of 
the model described in
    <xref target="CCAMP-MW" /> 
as the starting
  point, since it is a data model providing the wanted alignment with
       <xref target="RFC8343" pageno="false" format="default" />.  
To cover the identified gaps, it is recommended to define new
 leafs/parameters and include those in the new model 
<xref target="IETF-MW" pageno="false" format="default" /> while taking 
       reference from <xref target="ONF-CIM" pageno="false" format="default"
       />. It is also recommended to add the required data nodes to describe
       the interface layering for the capacity provided 
       by a Radio Link Terminal and the associated Ethernet and TDM interfaces
       in a microwave node. The principles and data nodes for interface
       layering described in <xref target="RFC8343" pageno="false"
       format="default" /> should be used as a basis.

   <section anchor="Generic" title="Generic Functionality" toc="default">
    <t>For generic functionality, not functionality specific to radio links,
    the recommendation is to refer to existing RFCs or emerging Internet-Drafts

    <t>  Microwave-specific alarm configurations are recommended to be
  included in the new model
  <xref target="IETF-MW"/> and could be based on what is supported in 
  the models described in <xref target="ONF-MW"/> 
and
<xref target="CCAMP-MW"/>. 
Alarm notifications and synchronization
    are general and are recommended to be supported by a generic model, such as
    <xref target="YANG-ALARM" pageno="false" format="default" />.</t>

    <t>
  Activation of interval counters and thresholds could be a generic
  function, but it is recommended to be supported by the new model
  <xref target="IETF-MW"/>.  It can be based on the models described in
  <xref target="ONF-MW"/> and <xref target="CCAMP-MW"/>.

</t>
   
    <t>Collection of interval/historical counters is a generic function that
    needs to be supported in a node. File-based
    collection via the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) and collection via
    NETCONF/YANG interfaces are two possible options; the recommendation is to
    include 
  support for the latter in the new model
  <xref target="IETF-MW"/>.
  The models described in <xref target="ONF-MW"/> and <xref
  target="CCAMP-MW"/> can also be used
  as a basis in this area.
</t>
   
    <t>Physical and/or equipment inventory associated with the Radio Link
    Terminals and Carrier Terminations is recommended to be covered by a
    generic model for the complete node, e.g., the model defined in <xref target="RFC8348"
    pageno="false" format="default" />. 
  It is thereby outside the scope of the new model <xref target="IETF-MW"/>.  
</t>

   <section anchor="Summary" title="Summary" toc="default">
    <t>The conclusions and recommendations from the analysis can be summarized as follows:   
     <list style="numbers">
      <t>A new YANG data model for radio link <xref target="IETF-MW"/> should be defined
      with enough scope to support the use cases and requirements in
Sections <xref
      target="Use" format="counter" /> and <xref target="Requirements"
      format="counter" /> of this document.</t>
	 
	  <t>
Use the structure of the model described in
<xref target="CCAMP-MW"/> as the
       starting point.  
It augments <xref target="RFC8343" pageno="false"
	  format="default" /> and is thereby as required aligned with the
	  structure of the models for management of the L2 and L3 domains.</t>
	 
	  <t>Use established microwave equipment and radio standards (such as
	  <xref target="EN302217-2" pageno="false" format="default" />, 
the model described in <xref target="CCAMP-MW"/>, and the model described in
      <xref target="ONF-MW"/>) as the basis for the definition of the detailed leafs/
      parameters to support the specified use cases and requirements,
      proposing new ones to cover identified gaps.

</t>

	 
	  <t>Add the required data nodes to describe the interface layering
	  for the capacity provided by a Radio Link Terminal and the
	  associated Ethernet and TDM interfaces, using the principles and
	  data nodes for interface layering described in <xref
	  target="RFC8343" pageno="false" format="default" /> as a basis.</t>



	  <t>Include support for configuration of microwave-specific alarms in
      the new YANG data model 
      <xref target="IETF-MW"/> and rely on a generic
      model such as
	  <xref target="YANG-ALARM" pageno="false" format="default" /> for
	  notifications and alarm synchronization.</t>

	 
	  <t>Use a generic model such as <xref target="RFC8348" pageno="false"
	  format="default" /> for physical/equipment inventory.</t>

  <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations" toc="default">
   <t>The configuration information may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in network environments.  Unauthorized access to configuration data nodes
   can have a negative effect on network operations, e.g., interrupting the
   ability to forward traffic or increasing the interference level of the
   network. The status and inventory reveal some network information that
   could be very helpful to an attacker. A malicious attack to that
   information may result in a loss of customer data. Security issues
   concerning the access control to management interfaces can be generally
   addressed by authentication techniques providing origin verification,
   integrity, and confidentiality. In addition, management interfaces can be
   physically or logically isolated by configuring them to be only accessible
   out-of-band, through a system that is physically or logically separated
   from the rest of the network infrastructure.  In cases where management
   interfaces are accessible in-band at the client device or within the
   microwave transport network domain, filtering or firewalling techniques can
   be used to restrict unauthorized in-band traffic. Additionally, authentication techniques may be used in all cases.</t>
   
   <t>This framework describes the requirements and characteristics of a YANG data model for control and management of the radio link interfaces in a microwave node. It is supposed to be accessed via a management protocol with a secure transport layer, such as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241" pageno="false" format="default" />.</t>
