        <t>Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as
        pieces of information or server processes that are available in
        several equivalent replicas on different hosts. This includes, but
        is not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal
        of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
        guidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts
        from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired resource.
        This guidance shall be based on parameters that affect performance
        and efficiency of the data transmission between the hosts, e.g., the
        topological distance.  The ultimate goal is to improve performance
        or Quality of Experience in the application while reducing
        the utilization of the underlying network infrastructure.</t>

        <t>This document enumerates requirements for specifying, assessing,
        or comparing protocols and implementations.  </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
        <t>The motivation for Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
        is described in the ALTO problem statement
        <xref target="RFC5693"/>.</t>

        <t>The goal of ALTO is to provide information that can help
        peer-to-peer (P2P) applications make better decisions with
        respect to peer selection. However, ALTO may be useful for non-P2P
        applications as well. For example, clients of client-server 
        applications may use information provided by ALTO to select one 
        of several servers or information replicas. As another example, 
        ALTO information could be used to
        select a media relay needed for NAT traversal. The goal of these
        informed decisions is to improve performance or Quality
        of Experience in the application while reducing
        the utilization of the underlying network infrastructure.</t>



        <t> Usually, it would be difficult or even impossible for
        application entities to acquire this information by other mechanisms,
        e.g., using measurements between the peers of a P2P overlay,
        because of complexity or because it is based on network topology
        information, network operational costs, or network policies, 
        which the respective network provider does not want to
        disclose in detail.</t>

        <t>The functional entities that provide the ALTO service do not take
        part in the actual user-data transport, i.e., they do not implement
        functions for relaying user data. These functional entities
        may be placed on various kinds of physical nodes, e.g., on
        dedicated servers, as auxiliary processes in routers, on 
        "trackers" or "super peers"
        of a P2P application, etc.</t>

        <section title="Requirements Notation">
            <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
            "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
            and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
            described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

        <section anchor="altoterminology" title="ALTO Terminology">
            <t>This document uses the following ALTO-related terms, which are 
            defined in <xref target="RFC5693"/>:
            </t>

            <t>
                Application,
                Peer,
                P2P,  
                Resource,
                Resource Identifier,
                Resource Provider,
                Resource Consumer,
                Transport Address,

                Resource Directory,
                ALTO Service,
                ALTO Server,
                ALTO Client,
                ALTO Query,
                ALTO Response,
                ALTO Transaction,
                Local Traffic,
                Peering Traffic,
                Transit Traffic,
                Application Protocol,
                ALTO Client Protocol, and
                Provisioning Protocol.
            </t>

            <t>Furthermore, the following additional terms will be used:</t>
            <t><list style='symbols'>
                <t>Host-Group Descriptor: 
                    Information used to describe one or more Internet hosts
                    (such as the
                    resource consumer that seeks ALTO guidance, or one or
                    more candidate resource providers) and their location
                    within the network topology.
                    There can be several different types of host-group
                    descriptors, for
                    example, a single IP address, an address prefix or
                    address range that contains the host(s), or an Autonomous
                    System (AS) number.
                    Different host-group descriptor types may provide
                    different levels of detail.  Depending on the system
                    architecture, this may have implications on the quality
                    of the guidance ALTO is able to provide, on
                    whether recommendations can be aggregated, and on how
                    much privacy-sensitive information about users might be
                    disclosed to additional parties.
                </t>

                <t> Rating Criterion: The condition or relation that defines 
                    the "better" in "better-than-random peer selection", which
                    is the ultimate goal of ALTO.  Examples may include
                    "host's Internet access is not subject to volume-based
charging (flat rate)" or "low topological 
                    distance". Some rating criteria, such as "low
                    topological distance", need to include a reference
                    point, e.g., "low topological distance from a given
                    resource consumer".  This reference point
                    can be described by means of a
                    host-group descriptor.
                </t>

                <t> Host-Characteristics Attribute: Properties of a host,
                    other than the host-group descriptor.
                    It may be evaluated according to one or more rating
                    criteria. 
                    This information may be stored in an ALTO server and
                    transmitted via an ALTO protocol. 
                    One example for a host-characteristics attribute would
                    be a data field indicating whether a host's Internet
                    access is subject to volume-based charging or not (flat
                    rate).
                </t>

                <t>Target-Aware Query Mode: In this mode of operation,
                    an ALTO client performs
                    the ALTO query when the desired resource and a set of
                    candidate resource providers are already known, i.e.,
                    after Distributed Hash Table (DHT) lookups, 
                    queries to the resource directory, etc. 

                    To this end, the ALTO client transmits a list of host-group descriptors and optionally one or more rating
                    criteria to the ALTO server. The ALTO server evaluates
                    the host-group descriptors according to the indicated
                    criteria or a default criterion. It returns a list of
                    these host-group descriptors to the ALTO client, which
                    is sorted according to the rating criteria and/or
                    enriched with host-characteristics attributes.
                </t>

                <t>Target-Independent Query Mode:
                    In this mode of operation, ALTO queries are performed in
                    advance or periodically, in order to receive
                    comprehensive guidance. The ALTO client indicates the
                    desired host-characteristics attributes in the ALTO
                    query. The ALTO server answers with a list that
                    indicates for all known host-group descriptors (possibly
                    subject to the server's policies) the desired host-characteristics attributes.  These lists will be cached
                    locally and evaluated later, when a resource is to be
                    accessed.
               </t>

        <section title="Architectural Framework for ALTO">

        <t> There are various architectural options for ALTO 
        implementation. Specifying or mandating one specific architecture is
        out of the scope of this document.</t>

        <t>In addition to the terminology (see Section 2 of 
        <xref target="RFC5693"/> and <xref target="altoterminology"/> 
        of this document), <xref target="RFC5693"/> presents a figure that
        gives a high-level overview of protocol interaction between these
        components.</t>

        <t> This document itemizes requirements for the following components:
        ALTO client protocols, ALTO server discovery mechanisms, host-group
        descriptors, rating criteria, and host-characteristics attributes.
        Furthermore, requirements regarding the overall architecture,
        especially with respect to security and privacy issues, are
        presented.</t>

        <t>Note that the detailed specification of such protocols and
        mechanisms is
        out of the scope of this document. 
        In fact, this document does not even assume that there
        will be only one single specification for each of these
        components, respectively.

        However, this document
        enumerates requirements for ALTO to be considered
        when specifying, assessing, or comparing protocols and
        implementations.</t>

        <section anchor="req_acp" title="ALTO Client Protocol">

            <section anchor="req_acp_gr" title="General Requirements">

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-1: 
                The ALTO service is provided by one or more ALTO servers. It
                may be queried by ALTO clients seeking guidance for
                selecting appropriate resource providers.

                ALTO clients and ALTO servers MUST implement an ALTO client
                protocol. An ALTO client protocol MUST be able to transmit
                ALTO queries from an ALTO client to an ALTO server, and it
                MUST be able to transmit the corresponding ALTO replies
                from the ALTO server to the ALTO client.
                </t>

                <t>The detailed specification of an ALTO client protocol is
                out of the scope of this document. 
                In fact, this document does not even assume that there
                will be only one single protocol specification.
                However, this document
                enumerates requirements for ALTO, to be considered
                when specifying, assessing, or comparing protocols and
                implementations.</t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-2: An ALTO client protocol MUST provide adequate mechanisms
                for operations and management support, as outlined in 
                RFC 5706 <xref target="RFC5706"/>.</t>
            </section>


            <section anchor="req_acp_hla" 
                title="Host-Group Descriptor Support">

                <t>The ALTO guidance is based on the evaluation of several
                resource providers or groups of resource providers,
                considering one or more rating criteria. The resource
                providers or groups of resource providers are characterized
                by means of host-group descriptors.</t>


                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-3: An ALTO client protocol MUST support the
                usage of multiple host-group descriptor types.</t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-4: 
                ALTO clients and ALTO servers MUST clearly
                identify the type of each host-group descriptor
                sent in ALTO queries or responses.
                An ALTO protocol specification MUST provide appropriate
                protocol elements.
                </t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-5: An ALTO client protocol MUST support the host
                group descriptor types "IPv4 address prefix" and "IPv6
                address prefix". They can be used to specify the IP address
                of one host, or an IP address range (in Classless Inter-Domain
Routing (CIDR) notation)
                containing all hosts in question. </t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-6: An ALTO client protocol MUST be extensible to
                enable future support of other host-group descriptor types.
An ALTO client protocol specification MUST
                define an appropriate procedure for adding new host-group descriptor types, e.g., by establishing an
                IANA registry.</t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-7: For host-group descriptor types other than
                "IPv4 address prefix" and "IPv6 address prefix", the
                host-group descriptor type identification MUST be
                supplemented by a reference to a facility that can
                be used to translate host-group descriptors of this
                type to IPv4/IPv6 address prefixes, e.g., by means
                of a mapping table or an algorithm.</t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-8: Protocol functions for mapping other host-group
                descriptor types to IPv4/IPv6 address prefixes SHOULD be
                designed and specified as part of an ALTO client protocol,
                and the corresponding address mapping information SHOULD
                be made available by the same entity that wants to use
                these host-group descriptors within an ALTO client
                protocol. However, an ALTO server or an ALTO client MAY
                also send a reference to an external mapping facility,
                e.g., a translation table to be obtained via an alternative
                mechanism.</t>

                <t><list style='hanging'><t>Rationale for the previous two
                requirements: The preferred type of host-group descriptors
                are IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes.  However, in some situations, one
                party may prefer to use another type, e.g., AS numbers.
                Usually, applications seeking ALTO guidance work with IP
                addresses, e.g., when establishing connections.
                Understanding guiding information that is based on other
                host-group descriptor types, i.e., mapping from these other
                types to IP prefixes and back, may be a non-trivial task.
                Therefore, before a party may use other host-group
                descriptor types, they must provide a mapping mechanism to
                IP prefixes.  </t></list></t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-9: An ALTO client protocol specification MUST
                define mechanisms that can be used by the ALTO server
                to indicate that a host-group
                descriptor used by the ALTO client is of an unsupported
                type, or that the indicated mapping mechanism could not 
                be used.</t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-10: An ALTO client protocol specification MUST
                define mechanisms that can be used by the ALTO client
                to indicate that a host-group
                descriptor used by the ALTO server is of an unsupported
                type, or that the indicated mapping mechanism could not 
                be used.</t>

            </section>


            <section anchor="req_acp_rc" title="Rating Criteria Support">

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-11: An ALTO client protocol specification MUST
                define a rating criterion that can be used to express
                and evaluate the "relative operator's preference".
                This is a relative measure, i.e., it is not
                associated with any unit of measurement. A preferred
                rating,
                according to this criterion, indicates that the application
                should prefer the respective candidate resource provider
                over others with less preferred ratings (unless information 
                from non-ALTO sources suggests a different choice, such 
                as transmission attempts suggesting that the path is 
                currently congested).
                The operator of the ALTO server does not have to disclose
                how and based on which data the ratings are actually
                computed. Examples could be: cost for peering or transit
                traffic, traffic engineering inside the network, and other
                policies.</t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-12: An ALTO client protocol MUST be extensible to
                enable future support of other rating criteria types.
An ALTO client protocol specification MUST
                define an appropriate procedure for adding new 
                rating criteria types, e.g., by establishing an
                IANA registry.</t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-13: ALTO client protocol specifications MUST NOT
                define rating criteria closely related to the instantaneous
                network congestion state, 
                i.e., rating criteria that have the primary aim to serve
                as an alternative to established congestion control strategies,
                such as using TCP-based transport.</t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-14: Applications using ALTO guidance MUST NOT rely
                solely on
                the ALTO guidance to avoid causing network congestion.  Instead,
                they MUST use other appropriate means, such as 
                TCP-based transport, to avoid causing excessive congestion.</t>

                <t><list style='hanging'>
                <t>Rationale for the previous requirement: 
                One design assumption for ALTO is that it is acceptable
                for the host-characteristics attributes, which are stored
                and processed in the ALTO servers for giving guidance,
                to be updated rather infrequently.  Typical update intervals
                may be several orders of magnitude longer than the typical
                network-layer packet round-trip time (RTT). Therefore, ALTO
                cannot be a replacement for TCP-like congestion control
                mechanisms.</t></list></t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-15: In the target-independent query mode, the ALTO
                query message SHOULD allow the ALTO client to express which
                host-characteristics attributes should be returned.</t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-16: In the target-aware query mode, the ALTO query
                message SHOULD allow the ALTO client to express which
                rating criteria should be considered by the server, as
                well as their relative relevance for the specific
                application that will eventually make use of the
                guidance. The corresponding ALTO response message 
                SHOULD allow the ALTO server
                to express which rating criteria have been considered when
                generating the response.</t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-17: An ALTO client protocol specification MUST define
                mechanisms that can be used by the ALTO client and the
                ALTO server to indicate that a rating criteria used by the
                other party is of an unsupported type.</t>

                <t>With respect to the placement of ALTO clients, 
                several modes of operation exist:</t>
                <t><list style='symbols'>
                    <t>One mode of ALTO operation is that an ALTO client may
                    be embedded directly in the resource consumer, i.e., the
                    application protocol entity that will eventually
                    initiate data transmission to/from the selected resource
                    provider(s) in order to access the desired resource.
                    For example, an ALTO client could be integrated into
                    the peer of a P2P application that uses a distributed
                    algorithm such as "query flooding" for resource discovery.
                    </t>
                    <t>Another mode of operation is to integrate the
                    ALTO client into a third party, such as a resource
                    directory. This third party may issue ALTO queries to
                    solicit preference on potential resource providers,
                    considering the respective resource consumer.
                    For example, an ALTO client could be integrated into
                    the tracker of a tracker-based P2P application, in
                    order to request ALTO guidance on behalf of the
                    peers contacting the tracker.
                    </t>
                </list></t>
                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-18: An ALTO client protocol MUST support the mode of
                operation in which the ALTO client is directly embedded
                in the resource consumer.</t>
                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-19: An ALTO client protocol MUST support the mode of
                operation in which the ALTO client is embedded in a
                third party. This third party performs queries on behalf of
                resource consumers.</t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-20: An ALTO client protocol MUST be designed in a way
                that the ALTO service can be provided by an entity that
                is not the operator of the underlying IP network.</t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-21: An ALTO client protocol MUST be designed in a way
                that different instances of the ALTO service operated by
                different providers can coexist.</t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-22: An ALTO client protocol specification MUST 
                specify  at least one
                query mode, either the target-aware or the
                target-independent query mode.
                </t>
                <t>
                Note that this requirements document does not assume that there
                will be only one single protocol specification.
                </t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-23: An ALTO client protocol specification SHOULD 
                specify both the
                target-aware and the target-independent query mode.
                If an ALTO client protocol specification specifies 
                more than one query mode, it MUST define at least one of these
                modes as REQUIRED to implement by ALTO clients and ALTO
                servers.  Furthermore, it
                MUST specify an appropriate protocol mechanism
                for negotiating between the ALTO client and ALTO server,
                which query mode to use.</t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-24: An ALTO client protocol SHOULD support version
                numbering, TTL (time-to-live) attributes, and/or similar
                mechanisms in ALTO transactions, in order to enable time
                validity checking for caching, and to enable comparisons of
                multiple recommendations obtained through
                redistribution.</t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-25: An ALTO client protocol SHOULD allow the ALTO
                server to add information about appropriate modes of reuse
                to its ALTO responses. Reuse may include redistributing an
                ALTO response to other parties, as well as using the same ALTO
                information in a resource directory to improve the responses
                to different resource consumers within the specified
                lifetime of the ALTO response. The ALTO server SHOULD be
                able to express that
                <list style='symbols'>
                    <t>no reuse should occur.</t>
                    <t>reuse is appropriate for a specific "target
                    audience", i.e., a set of resource consumers
                    explicitly defined by a list of host-group descriptors.
                    The ALTO server MAY specify a "target audience" in the
                    ALTO response that is only a subset of the known actual
                    "target audience", e.g., if required by operator
                    policies.</t>
                    <t>reuse is appropriate for any resource consumer that
                    would send (or cause a third party to send on behalf of
                    it) the same ALTO query (i.e., with the same query
                    parameters, except for the resource consumer ID, if
                    applicable) to this ALTO server.</t>

                the ALTO client is located in the private address realm
                behind a network address translator (NAT). There are

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-30: An ALTO client protocol specification
                MUST specify mechanisms for an ALTO server to inform clients
                about an impending or occurring overload situation, or how
                to leverage appropriate mechanisms provided by underlying
                protocol layers. The mechanisms MUST provide all of the
                following options to the server:
                <list style='symbols'>
                    <t>terminate the conversation with the client,</t>

                <t>In particular, a simple
                form of throttling is to let an ALTO server answer a query
                with an error message

                using a protocol function such as HTTP's Retry-After header
                (<xref target="RFC2616"/>, Section 14.37)).
                Another simple option is to actually answer the query with
                the desired information, but adding an indication that
                the ALTO client should not send further queries to this
                ALTO server before an indicated period of time has
                elapsed.</t>

                <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-31: An ALTO client protocol specification
                MUST specify mechanisms for an ALTO server to inform clients
                about its inability to answer queries due to technical 
                problems or system maintenance, or how
                to leverage appropriate mechanisms provided by underlying

                situation, respectively. Some servers may be unable to use

            an ALTO client, as well as general requirements to be fulfilled by
            the ALTO server discovery mechanisms.</t>

            <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-32: An ALTO server discovery mechanism MUST support
            features allowing ALTO clients that are embedded in the resource
            consumer to find one or several ALTO servers that can provide
            ALTO guidance suitable for the resource consumer, using an ALTO
            protocol version compatible with the ALTO client. This mode of

            discovery".</t> 

            <t>Req.&nbsp;AR-33: An ALTO server discovery mechanism MUST support
            features allowing ALTO clients that are embedded in a resource
            directory and perform third-party ALTO queries on behalf of a
            remote resource consumer to find one or several ALTO servers

            resource consumer, using an ALTO protocol version compatible with
            the ALTO client.  This mode of operation is called

            existing protocol or mechanism, such as DNS-, DHCP-, or PPP-based
            automatic configuration, etc.  A single mechanism with a broad
            spectrum of applicability SHOULD be preferred over several

            title="Information Disclosure Scenarios">
            <t>The unwanted disclosure of information is one key concern
            related to ALTO.
            Neither the ALTO server nor a third party using or misusing the
            ALTO service should be able to infer the application behavior or
            correlate data in such a way that would violate user privacy,
            e.g., who is exchanging which
            files with whom using a P2P file-sharing application.
            Furthermore, many network
            operators are concerned about the amount of
            information related to their network infrastructure (e.g., topology
            information, number of "premium customers", or utilization
            statistics) that might be released through ALTO.  This section
            presents a classification and discussion of information disclosure
            scenarios and potential countermeasures.</t>
            
            <section title="Classification of Information Disclosure Scenarios">

                <t>The following issues may be considered a risk for the
                operator of an ALTO server, depending on the specific
                deployment scenario:</t>

                    <t>Excess disclosure of the ALTO server operator's data
                    to an authorized ALTO client. The operator of an ALTO
                    server has to feed information, such as tables
                    mapping host-group descriptors to host-characteristics 
                    attributes, into the server, thereby enabling it to
                    give guidance to ALTO clients. Some operators might
                    consider the full set of this information confidential
                    (e.g., a detailed map of the operator's network topology)
                    and might want to disclose only a subset of it or 
                    disclose somehow obfuscated information to an ALTO client.

                    time, and redistribute the responses among each other
                    (see also case 2c).  By aggregating and correlating the

            <section title="Discussion of Information Disclosure Scenarios">

                <t>An ALTO server operator should consider:</t>

                <t><list style='symbols'>

                <t>Issue (1) may be addressed by the ALTO server operator
                choosing the level of detail of the information to be populated
                into the ALTO server and returned in the responses.
                For example,
                by specifying a broader address range (i.e., a shorter prefix
                length) than a group of hosts in question actually uses,
                an ALTO server operator may control to some extent how much
                information about the network topology is disclosed.
                Furthermore, access control mechanisms for filtering ALTO
                responses according to the authenticated ALTO client identity
                might be installed in the ALTO server, although this might not 
                be effective
                given the lack of efficient mechanisms for addressing (2c) and
                (3), see below.</t>

                <t>(2a) and (2b) may be addressed by authentication,
                access control, and encryption schemes for the ALTO client
                protocol. However, deployment of encryption schemes might not be
                effective given the lack of efficient mechanisms for addressing
                (2c) and (3), see below.</t>

                <t>Straightforward authentication and encryption schemes will not
                help solving (2c) and (3), and there is no other simple and
                efficient mechanism known. The cost of complex approaches, e.g.,
                based on Digital Rights Management (DRM), might easily outweigh
                the benefits of the whole ALTO solution; therefore, they are
                not considered as a viable solution. That is, ALTO server
                operators must be aware that (2c) and (3) cannot be prevented
                from happening; therefore, they should feed only such
                data into an ALTO server that they do not consider sensitive
                with respect to (2c) and (3).  </t>


                </list></t>

                <t>A user of an ALTO client should consider:</t>

                <t><list style='symbols'>

                <t>Issue (4) can and needs to be addressed in several ways: If the
                ALTO client is embedded in the resource consumer, the
                resource consumer's IP address (or the "public" IP address
                of the outermost NAT in front of the resource consumer) is
                disclosed to the ALTO server as a matter of principle,
                because it is in the source address fields of the IP
                headers. By using a proxy, the disclosure of source
                addresses to the ALTO server can be avoided at the cost of
                disclosing them to said proxy.  If, in contrast, the ALTO client
                is embedded in a third party (e.g., a resource directory),
                which issues ALTO requests on behalf of resource consumers,
                it is possible to hide the exact addresses of the resource
                consumers from the ALTO server, e.g., by zeroing out or
                randomizing the last few bits of IP addresses. However,
                there is the potential side effect of yielding inaccurate
                results.</t>

                </list><list style='hanging'>
                <t>The disclosure of candidate resource providers' addresses
                to the ALTO server can be avoided
                by allowing ALTO clients to use the
                target-independent query mode. In this mode of operation,
                guiding information (e.g., "maps") is retrieved from the
                ALTO server and used entirely locally by the ALTO client,
                i.e., without sending host-location attributes of candidate
                resource providers to the ALTO server.
                In the target-aware query mode, this issue can be addressed 
                by ALTO clients through obfuscating the identity of candidate
                resource consumers, e.g., by specifying a broader address range
                (i.e., a shorter prefix length) than a group of hosts in
                question actually uses, or by zeroing out or randomizing 
                the last few bits of IP addresses.
                However, there is
                the potential side effect of yielding inaccurate results.</t>
                </list><list style='symbols'>

                <t>(5a) may be addressed by mandating that
                the ALTO server discovery procedure, as a whole, must be secure
                against spoofing.</t>

                </list><list style='hanging'>
                <t>Note: Given that this document does not mandate a
                specific system architecture, it is difficult to specify
                more details than that the discovery procedure, as a whole,
                should be secure against spoofing.  There are many different
                architectural options, e.g., have an insecure discovery
                mechanism and use server certificates to later verify its
                response (cf. the DNS + HTTPS security model widely used in
                the World Wide Web). Therefore, at this requirements stage,
                it is not mandatory for the discovery mechanism itself to be
                secure against spoofing attacks.</t>
                </list><list style='symbols'>

                <t>(5b) may be addressed by encryption schemes for the ALTO
                client protocol. However, the effort vs. benefit
                should be evaluated for any specific deployment
                scenario, while also considering the risks and solution
                approaches for issues (4), (5c), and (6).</t>

                <t>Straightforward authentication and encryption schemes
                will not help solving (5c) and (6).  However, potential
                risks can be mitigated using the same approaches as used for
                issue (4), see above.</t>
