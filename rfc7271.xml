 <section title="Introduction">
   <t>
   Linear protection mechanisms for the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
   are described in RFC 6378 <xref target="RFC6378"/>
   to meet the requirements described in RFC 5654 <xref target="RFC5654"/>. 
   </t> 
   <t>
   This document describes alternate mechanisms to perform some of the
   functions of linear protection, and also defines additional 
   mechanisms. The purpose of these alternate and additional mechanisms
   is to provide operator control and experience that more closely 
   models the behavior of linear protection seen in other transport 
   networks, such as Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH), 
   Optical Transport Network (OTN), and Ethernet transport networks.
   Linear protection for SDH, OTN, and Ethernet transport networks is
   defined in ITU-T Recommendations G.841 <xref target="G841"/>, 
   G.873.1 <xref target="G873.1"/>, and G.8031 <xref target="G8031"/>, 
   respectively.
   </t>   
   <t>
   The reader of this document is assumed to be familiar with 
   <xref target="RFC6378"/>.
   </t>

   <t>The alternative mechanisms described in this document 
   are for the following capabilities:
    <list style="hanging" hangIndent="4">
     <t hangText="1."> Priority modification, 
     </t>
     <t hangText="2."> non-revertive behavior modification, 
     </t>
    </list>
   </t>
   <t>and the following capabilities have been added to define additional 
   mechanisms:
    <list style="hanging" hangIndent="4">
     <t hangText="3."> support of the Manual Switch to Working path (MS-W) 
     command, 
     </t>
     <t hangText="4."> support of protection against Signal Degrade (SD), and
     </t>
     <t hangText="5."> support of the Exercise (EXER) command. 
     </t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>The priority modification includes raising the priority of 
   Signal Fail on Protection path (SF-P) relative to Forced Switch (FS),
   and raising the priority level of Clear Signal Fail (SFc) above SF-P.
  </t> 

  <t>Non-revertive behavior is modified 
  to align with the behavior defined in RFC 4427 <xref target="RFC4427"/> 
  as well as 
  to follow the behavior of linear protection seen in other transport networks.
  </t>

  <t>Support of the MS-W command to revert traffic to the working path 
  in non-revertive operation is covered in this document. 
  </t>

  <t>Support of the protection-switching protocol against SD 
  is covered in this document.
  The specifics for the method of identifying SD are out of the scope 
  for this document and are treated similarly to Signal Fail (SF) in 
  <xref target="RFC6378"/>. 
  </t>

  <t>Support of the EXER command to test if the Protection State Coordination 
  (PSC) communication is operating correctly is also covered in this document. 

   Without actually switching traffic, the EXER command tests and validates the linear protection
   mechanism and PSC protocol including the aliveness of the priority
   logic, the PSC state machine, the PSC message generation and
   reception, and the integrity of the protection path.

  </t>

   <t>
   This document introduces capabilities and modes. 
   A capability is an individual behavior. 
   The capabilities of a node are advertised using the method given 
   in this document.
   A mode is a particular combination of capabilities. 
   Two modes are defined in this document: PSC mode 
   and Automatic Protection Switching (APS) mode.
   </t>

   <t>
   Other modes may be defined as new combinations of the capabilities 
   defined in this document or through the definition of additional 
   capabilities. 
   In either case, the specification defining a new mode will be responsible 
   for documenting the behavior, the priority logic, and the state machine of 
   the PSC protocol when the set of capabilities in the new mode is enabled.
   </t>

   <t>
   This document describes the behavior, 
   the priority logic, and the state machine of the PSC protocol
   when all the capabilities 
   associated with the APS mode are enabled.
   The PSC protocol behavior for the PSC mode is as defined in 
   <xref target="RFC6378"/>.   
   </t>

   <t>
   This document updates <xref target="RFC6378"/> 
   by adding a capability advertisement mechanism. 
   It is recommended that existing implementations of 
   the PSC protocol be updated to support this capability. 
   Backward compatibility with existing implementations 
   that do not support this mechanism is described
   in <xref target="secModePSC"/>.
   </t>

   <t>
   Implementations are expected to be configured to support a specific
   set of capabilities (a mode) and to reject messages that indicate the
   use of a different set of capabilities (a different mode). Thus, the
   capability advertisement is not a negotiation but a verification
   that peers are using the same mode.

 <section anchor="secCap1" title="Capability 1: Priority Modification">
   <t><xref target="RFC6378"/> defines the priority of FS 
   to be higher than that of SF-P.
   That document also defines the priority of Clear SF (SFc) to be low.
   This document defines the priority modification capability
   whereby the relative priorities of FS and SF-P are swapped, 
   and the priority of
   Clear SF (SFc) is raised. In addition, this capability introduces 
   the Freeze command as described in <xref target="secFreeze"/>. 
   The rationale for these changes is detailed in the following subsections 
   from both the technical and network operational aspects.
   </t> 

 <section title="Motivation for Swapping Priorities of FS and SF-P"> 
   <t>Defining the priority of FS higher than that of SF-P can result in
   a situation where the protected traffic is taken out of service. 
   When the protection path fails, PSC communication may stop as a 
   result. In this case, if any input that is supposed to be signaled to
   the other end has a higher priority than SF-P, then this can result in
   an unpredictable protection-switching state.
   An example scenario that may result in an out-of-service situation
   is presented in 
   <xref target="secExOutofService"/> of this document.
   </t>

   <t>According to Section 2.4 of <xref target="RFC5654"/>,
   it MUST be possible to operate an MPLS-TP network without 
   using a control plane. This means that the PSC communication channel 
   is very important for the transfer of external switching commands 
   (e.g., FS), 
   and these commands should not rely on the presence of a control plane. 
   In consequence, the failure of the PSC communication channel has higher 
   priority than FS.
   </t>

   <t>In other transport networks (such as SDH, OTN, and Ethernet transport
   networks), the priority of SF-P has been higher than that of FS. It is 
   therefore important to offer network operators the option of having 
   the same behavior in their MPLS-TP networks so that they can have the
   same operational protection-switching behavior to which they have
   become accustomed.
   Typically, an FS command is issued before network maintenance jobs
   (e.g., replacing optical cables or other network components).
   When an operator pulls out a cable on the protection path, by mistake,
   the traffic should continue to be protected, and the operator expects 
   this behavior
   based on his/her experience with traditional transport network operations.
   </t>
 </section>

 <section title="Motivation for Raising the Priority of SFc"> 
   <t>The priority level of SFc defined in <xref target="RFC6378"/> 
   can cause traffic disruption when a node that has experienced 
   local signal fails on both the working and the protection paths 
   is recovering from these failures.
   </t>
   <t>A sequence diagram highlighting the problem with the
   priority level of SFc as defined in <xref target="RFC6378"/> 
   is presented in <xref target="secExClearSF"/>.
   </t>
 </section>

 <section title="Motivation for Introducing the Freeze Command"> 
   <t>With the priority swapping between FS and SF-P, the traffic is 
   always moved back to the working path when SF-P occurs in 
   Protecting Administrative state.
   In case network operators need an option to control their 
   networks so that the traffic can remain on the protection path 
   even when the PSC communication channel is broken,
   the Freeze command can be used.
   Freeze is defined to be a "local" command that is not signaled to 
   the remote node. 
   The use of the Freeze command is described in <xref target="secFreeze"/>.
   </t>
 </section>

 <section anchor="secPrio" 
          title="Procedures in Support of Priority Modification">
  <t>When the modified priority order specified in this document is in use, 
  the list of local requests in order of priority SHALL be as follows (from highest to lowest):
   <list style="symbols">
     <t>Clear Signal Fail
     </t> 
     <t>Signal Fail on Protection path
     </t>
     <t>Forced Switch
     </t>
     <t>Signal Fail on Working path
     </t>
   </list>
  </t>
  <t>This requires modification of the PSC Control Logic (including the state 
  machine) relative to that described in <xref target="RFC6378"/>. 
  Sections <xref target="secAPS" format="counter"/> and  
  <xref target="secStateMachine" format="counter"/>  
  present the PSC Control Logic when all capabilities of APS mode are enabled.
  </t>
 </section>
 </section>  <!-- End of Priority Modification section -->


 <section anchor="secNonRevertive" 
          title="Capability 2: Non-revertive Behavior Modification">
  <t>Non-revertive operation of protection switching is defined in 
  <xref target="RFC4427"/>. 
  In this operation, the traffic does not return to the working path 
  when switch-over requests are terminated.
  </t>

  <t>However, the PSC protocol defined in <xref target="RFC6378"/> 
  supports this operation only when recovering from a defect condition: 
  it does not support the non-revertive function when an operator's 
  switch-over command, such as FS or Manual Switch (MS), is cleared. 
  To be aligned with the behavior in other transport networks and 
  to be consistent with <xref target="RFC4427"/>, 
  a node should go into the Do-not-Revert (DNR) state not only when a failure 
  condition on the working path is cleared, but also when an operator command 
  that requested switch-over is cleared.
  </t>

  <t>This requires modification to the PSC Control Logic (including the state 
  machine) relative to that described in <xref target="RFC6378"/>. 
  Sections <xref target="secAPS" format="counter"/> and  
  <xref target="secStateMachine" format="counter"/>  
  present the PSC Control Logic when all capabilities of APS mode are enabled.
  </t>
 </section>  <!-- End of Non-revertive section -->


 <section title="Capability 3: Support of the MS-W Command">
 <section title="Motivation for adding MS-W">
  <t>Changing the non-revertive operation as described in 
  <xref target="secNonRevertive"/>
  introduces the necessity of a new 
  operator command to revert traffic to the working path in the DNR state.
  When the traffic is on the protection path in the DNR state,
  a Manual Switch to Working (MS-W) command is issued 
  to switch the normal traffic back to the working path.
  According to Section 4.3.3.6 (Do-not-Revert State) in 
  <xref target="RFC6378"/>, 
  "To revert back to the Normal state, the administrator SHALL issue a Lockout
  of protection command followed by a Clear command."
  However, using the Lockout of protection (LO) command introduces the potential risk of an unprotected 
  situation while the LO is in effect.
  </t>
  <t>The "Manual switch-over for recovery LSP/span" command is defined in 
  <xref target="RFC4427"/>. 
  Requirement 83 in <xref target="RFC5654"/> states that the
  external commands defined in <xref target="RFC4427"/>
  MUST be supported. 
  Since there is no support for this external command in 
  <xref target="RFC6378"/>, this functionality should be added to PSC.  
  This support is provided by introducing the MS-W command.
  The MS-W command, as described here, corresponds to the
  "Manual switch-over for recovery LSP/span" command. 
  </t>
 </section>

 <section anchor="MSterm" title="Terminology to Support MS-W">
   <t><xref target="RFC6378"/>
   uses the term "Manual Switch" and its acronym "MS". 
   This document uses the term "Manual Switch to Protection path" and
   "MS-P" to have the same meaning, while avoiding confusion with "Manual 
   Switch to Working path" and its acronym "MS-W".
   </t>
   <t>Similarly, we modify the name of "Protecting Administrative" state 
   (as defined in <xref target="RFC6378"/>) to be 
   "Switching Administrative" state to include the case where 
   traffic is switched to the working path as a result of 
   the external MS-W command.
   </t>
 </section>

 <section anchor="MSbehavior" title="Behavior of MS-P and MS-W">
   <t>MS-P and MS-W SHALL have the same priority.  
   We consider different instances of determining the priority of 
   the commands when they are received either in succession or simultaneously.
   <list style="symbols">
     <t>When two commands are received in succession, 
     the command that is received 
     after the initial command SHALL be cancelled.
     </t>
     <t>If two nodes simultaneously receive commands 
     that indicate opposite operations 
     (i.e., one node receives MS-P and the other node receives MS-W) 
     and transmit the indications to the remote node,  
     the MS-W SHALL be considered to have a higher priority, 
     and the MS-P SHALL be cancelled and discarded.
     </t>
   </list>
   </t>
   <t>
   Two commands, MS-P and MS-W, are transmitted using the same Request field
   value but SHALL indicate in the Fault Path (FPath) value
   the path from which the traffic is being diverted.
   When traffic is switched to the protection path, 
   the FPath field value SHALL be set to 1, 
   indicating that traffic is being diverted from the working path.
   When traffic is switched to the working path, 
   the FPath field value SHALL be set to 0, 
   indicating that traffic is being diverted from the protection path.
   The Data Path (Path) field SHALL indicate where user data traffic is being
   transported 
   (i.e., if the working path is selected, then Path is set to 0; 
   if the protection path is selected, then Path is set to 1).
   </t>
   <t>When an MS command is in effect at a node, 
   any subsequent MS or EXER command and any other lower-priority requests 
   SHALL be ignored.
   </t>
 </section>

 <section anchor="MSequal" title="Equal-Priority Resolution for MS">
   <t><xref target="RFC6378"/>
   defines only one rule for the equal-priority condition in 
   Section 4.3.2 as 
   "The remote message from the far-end LER is assigned a priority just
   below the similar local input."
   In order to support the Manual Switch behavior described in 
   <xref target="MSbehavior"/>, 
   additional rules for equal-priority resolution are required.  
   Since the support of protection against signal degrade also requires 
   a similar equal-priority resolution, the rules are described in 
   <xref target="SDequal"/>.
   </t>
   <t>Support of this function requires changes to the PSC Control Logic
   (including the state machine) relative to that shown in

 <section title="Capability 4: Support of Protection against SD">
 <section title="Motivation for Supporting Protection against SD">
   <t>In the MPLS-TP Survivability Framework <xref target="RFC6372"/>, 
   both SF and SD fault conditions can be used to trigger protection switching.

   <t><xref target="RFC6378"/>,
   which defines the protection-switching protocol for MPLS-TP,
   does not specify how the SF and SD are detected, 
   and specifies the protection-switching protocol associated with SF only.
   </t>
   <t>
   The PSC protocol associated with SD is covered in this document, 
   but the specifics for the method of identifying SD is
   out of scope for the protection protocol 
   in the same way that SF detection and MS or FS command initiation
   are out of scope.

   <t>The second paragraph of Section 4.3.3.2 (Unavailable State) in 
   <xref target="RFC6378"/> shows the intention of including 
   Signal Degrade on Protection path (SD-P) in the Unavailable state. 
   Even though the protection path can be partially available

     <t>Once a switch has been completed due to SD on one path, 
     it will not be overridden by SD on the other path 
     (first come, first served behavior), 
     to avoid protection switching that cannot improve signal quality.
     </t>
   </list>
   </t>
   <t>The SD message indicates that the transmitting node has
   identified degradation of the signal or integrity of the packet
   received on either the working path or the protection path.  
   The FPath field SHALL identify the path that is
   reporting the degraded condition (i.e., if the protection path, then
   FPath is set to 0; if the working path, then FPath is set to 1), and
   the Path field SHALL indicate where the data traffic is being
   transported (i.e., if the working path is selected, then Path is set
   to 0; if the protection path is selected, then Path is set to 1).
   </t>
   <t>When the SD condition is cleared and the protected domain is recovering 
   from the situation, the Wait-to-Restore (WTR) timer SHALL be used 
   if the protected domain is configured for revertive behavior.
   The WTR timer SHALL be started at the node that recovers from 
   a local degraded condition on the working path. 
   </t>

   <t>Protection switching against SD is always provided by a selector bridge 
   duplicating user data traffic and feeding it to both the working path 
   and the protection path under SD condition. 
   When a local or remote SD occurs on either the working path or 
   the protection path, the node SHALL duplicate user data traffic 
   and SHALL feed it to both the working path and the protection path. 
   The packet duplication SHALL continue as long as any SD condition exists 
   in the protected domain. 
   When the SD condition is cleared, in revertive operation, 
   the packet duplication SHALL continue in the WTR state and SHALL stop 
   when the node leaves the WTR state; 
   while in non-revertive operation, the packet duplication SHALL stop 
   immediately.
   </t>
   <t>The selector bridge with the packet duplication under SD condition,
   which is a non-permanent bridge, is considered to be a 1:1 protection 
   architecture.
   </t>
   <t>Protection switching against SD does not introduce any modification 
   to the operation of the selector at the sink node described in 
   <xref target="RFC6378"/>. 
   The selector chooses either the working or protection path from which 
   to receive the normal traffic in both 1:1 and 1+1 architectures. 
   The position of the selector, i.e., which path to receive the traffic, 
   is determined by the PSC protocol in bidirectional switching 
   or by the local input in unidirectional switching.

 <section anchor="SDequal" title="Equal-Priority Resolution">
   <t>In order to support the MS behavior described in 
   <xref target="MSbehavior"/> and the protection against SD 
   described in <xref target="SDbehavior"/>, 
   it is necessary to expand rules for treating equal-priority inputs. 
   </t>
   <t>
   For equal-priority local inputs, such as MS and SD, 
   apply a simple first-come, first-served rule. 
   Once a local input is determined as the highest priority 
   local input, then a subsequent equal-priority local input 
   requesting a different action,
   i.e., the action results in the same PSC Request field but 
   different FPath value,
   will not be presented to the PSC Control Logic as the highest local request.
   Furthermore, in the case of an MS command, the subsequent local 
   MS command requesting a different action will be cancelled.
   </t>
   <t>If a node is in a remote state due to a remote SD (or MS) message, 
   a subsequent local input having the same priority  
   but requesting a different action to the PSC Control Logic
   will be considered as having lower priority than the remote message
   and will be ignored. 
   For example, if a node is in remote Switching Administrative state 
   due to a remote MS-P, then any subsequent local MS-W SHALL be ignored 
   and automatically cancelled. 
   If a node is in remote Unavailable state due to a remote SD-P, 
   then any subsequent local SD-W input will be ignored.
   However, the local SD-W SHALL continue to appear in the Local Request Logic 
   as long as the SD condition exists, 
   but it SHALL NOT be the top-priority global request,
   which determines the state transition at the PSC Control Logic.
   </t>
   <t>Cases where two end-points of the protected domain 
   simultaneously receive local triggers of the same priority 
   that request different actions may occur (for example, one node receives 
SD-P and the other receives SD-W). 
   Subsequently, each node will receive a remote message with the opposing 
   action indication. 
   To address these cases, we define the following priority resolution rules: 
   <list style="symbols">
     <t>When MS-W and MS-P occur simultaneously at both nodes, MS-W SHALL 
     be considered as having higher priority than MS-P at both nodes.
     </t>
     <t>When SD-W and SD-P occur simultaneously at both nodes, 
     the SD on the standby path (the path from which the selector does
     not select the user data traffic) is considered as having higher
     priority than the SD on the active path (the path from which the
     selector selects the user data traffic) regardless of its origin
     (local or remote message). Therefore, no unnecessary protection
     switching is performed, and the user data traffic continues to be
     selected from the active path.  
     </t>
   </list>
   </t>
   <t>
   In the preceding paragraphs, 
   "simultaneously" refers to the case 
   a sent SD (or MS) request has not been confirmed 
   by the remote end in bidirectional protection switching.
   When a local node that has transmitted an SD message receives 
   an SD (or MS) message that indicates a different value of 
   Path field from the value of Path field in 
   the transmitted SD (or MS) message, 
   both the local and remote SD requests are considered to occur 
   simultaneously.
   </t>
   <t>The addition of support for protection against SD requires 
   modification to the PSC Control Logic (including the state machine) 
   relative to that
   described in <xref target="RFC6378"/>. 
   Sections <xref target="secAPS" format="counter"/> and  
   <xref target="secStateMachine" format="counter"/>

 <section anchor="secCap5" title="Capability 5: Support of EXER Command">
   <t>The EXER command is used to verify the correct operation of 
   the PSC communication, such as the aliveness of the Local Request Logic,
   the integrity of the PSC Control Logic, 
   the PSC message generation and reception mechanism, 
   and the integrity of the protection path. 
   EXER does not trigger any actual traffic switching.
   </t>
   <t>The command is only relevant for bidirectional protection switching, 
   since it is dependent upon receiving a response from the remote node. 
   The EXER command is assigned lower priority than any switching message. 
   It may be used regardless of the traffic usage of the working path.
   </t>
   <t>When a node receives a remote EXER message, 
   it SHOULD respond with a Reverse Request (RR) message with 
   the FPath and Path fields set according to the current condition of the node.
   The RR message SHALL be generated only in response to a remote EXER message.
   </t>
   <t>This command is documented in R84 of <xref target="RFC5654"/>.

   <t>If EXER commands are input at both ends, then a race condition
   may arise. This is resolved as follows:
   <list style="symbols">

  <t>
   The value of the Length field is the length of the Flags field in octets.

   MUST be the minimum required to signal all the required capabilities.
  </t>
  <t>
   <xref target="secCap1"/> to <xref target="secCap5"/> discuss five
   capabilities that are signaled using the five most significant bits;
   if a node wishes to signal these five capabilities, 
   it MUST send a Flags field of 4 octets.  
   A node would send a Flags field greater than 4 octets only if 
   it had more than 32 Capabilities to indicate.  
   All unused bits MUST be set to zero.
   </t>
   <t>
   If the bit assigned for an individual capability is set to 1, it
   indicates the sending node's intent to use that capability in the
   protected domain.  If a bit is set to 0, the sending node does not
   intend to use the indicated capability in the protected domain.
   Note that it is not possible to distinguish between the intent not to
   use a capability and a node's complete non-support (i.e., lack of
   implementation) of a given capability.
   </t>
   <t>
   This document defines five specific capabilities that are described 
   in <xref target="secCap1"/> to <xref target="secCap5"/>.
   Each capability is assigned bit as follows:

   If all the five capabilities should be used, a node SHALL set 
   the Flags field to 0xF8000000.

 <section title="Sending and Receiving the Capabilities TLV">
   <t>A node MUST include its Capabilities TLV in every PSC message that 
   it transmits. The transmission and acceptance of the PSC message is
   described in Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC6378"/>.
   </t> 
   <t>
   When a node receives a Capabilities TLV, it MUST compare the Flags value
   to its most recent Flags value transmitted by the node.
   If the two are equal, the
   protected domain is said to be running in the mode indicated by that
   set of capabilities (see <xref target="secMode"/>).
   If the sent and received Capabilities TLVs are not equal, 
   this indicates a Capabilities TLV mismatch.  
   When this happens, the node MUST alert the operator and
   MUST NOT perform any protection switching until the operator resolves 
   the mismatch between the two end-points.

 <section anchor="secMode" title="Modes">
   <t>
   A mode is a given set of Capabilities.  Modes are shorthand;
   referring to a set of capabilities by their individual values or by
   the name of their mode does not change the protocol behavior.  This
   document defines two modes -- PSC and APS.

   Capabilities TLVs with other combinations than the one specified by a mode 
   are not supported in this specification.

 <section anchor="secModePSC" title="PSC Mode">

   </t>
   <t>There are two ways to declare PSC mode.  
   A node can send no Capabilities TLV at all since there are no TLV units

   set to 0x0. 
   In order to allow backward compatibility between two end-points -- one which

   the node that has the ability to send and process

 <section anchor="secPrioReqs" 
          title="Priorities of Local Inputs and Remote Requests">
  <t>Based on the description in Sections 3 and 4.3.2 in 
  <xref target="RFC6378"/>, 
  the priorities of multiple outstanding local inputs are evaluated in 
  the Local Request Logic, where the highest
  priority local input (highest local request) is determined.  
  This highest local request is passed to the PSC Control Logic 
  that will determine the higher-priority input (top-priority global request) 
  between the highest local request and the last received remote message. 
  When a remote message comes to the PSC Control Logic, the top-priority
  global request is determined between this remote message and
  the highest local request that is present.
  The top-priority global request is used to determine the state 
  transition, which is described in <xref target="secStateMachine"/>.
  In this document, in order to simplify the description on 
  the PSC Control Logic, we strictly decouple the priority evaluation 
  from the state transition table lookup.
  </t>
  <t>The priorities for both local and remote requests 
  are defined as follows from highest to lowest: 
   <list style="symbols">
    <t>Operator Clear (Local only)</t> 
    <t>Lockout of protection (Local and Remote) </t>
    <t>Clear Signal Fail or Degrade (Local only) </t>
    <t>Signal Fail on Protection path (Local and Remote) </t>
    <t>Forced Switch (Local and Remote)</t>
    <t>Signal Fail on Working  path (Local and Remote)</t>
    <t>Signal Degrade on either Protection path or Working path
       (Local and Remote) </t>
    <t>Manual Switch to either Protection path or Working path 
       (Local and Remote) </t>
    <t>WTR Timer Expiry (Local only) </t>
    <t>WTR (Remote only) </t>
    <t>Exercise (Local and Remote) </t>
    <t>Reverse Request (Remote only) </t>
    <t>Do-Not-Revert (Remote only) </t>
    <t>No Request (Remote and Local) </t>
   </list>
  </t>

  <t>
  Note that the "Local only" requests are not transmitted to the remote node. 
  Likewise, the "Remote only" requests do not exist 
  in the Local Request Logic as local inputs. 
  For example, the priority of WTR only applies to the received WTR message, 
  which is generated from the remote node. 
  The remote node that is running the WTR timer in the WTR state has 
  no local request.
  </t>
  
  <t>
  The remote SF and SD on either the working path or the protection path 
  and the remote MS to either the working path or the protection path 
  are indicated by the values of the Request and FPath fields 
  in the PSC message.
  </t>

  <t>The remote request from the remote node is assigned a priority just
  below the same local request 
  except for NR and equal-priority requests, such as SD and MS. 
  Since a received NR message needs to be used in the state transition table 
  lookup when there is no outstanding local request, 
  the remote NR request SHALL have a higher priority than the local NR. 
  For the equal-priority requests, see <xref target="secEqualPriority"/>.
  </t>

 <section anchor="secEqualPriority" 
          title="Equal-Priority Requests">
  <t>
  As stated in <xref target="secPrioReqs"/>, 
  the remote request from the remote node is assigned a priority just 
  below the same local request. 
  However, for equal-priority requests, such as SD and MS, 
  the priority SHALL be evaluated as described in this section.
  </t>

  <t>
  For equal-priority local requests, the first-come, first-served rule SHALL be 
  applied. Once a local request appears in the Local Request Logic, 
  a subsequent equal-priority local request requesting a different action, 
  i.e., the action results in the same Request value 
  but a different FPath value, 
  SHALL be considered to have a lower priority. 
  Furthermore, in the case of an MS command, the subsequent local MS command 
  requesting a different action SHALL be rejected and cleared.
  </t>

  <t>
  When the priority is evaluated in the PSC Control Logic 
  between the highest local request and a remote request, 
  the following equal-priority resolution rules SHALL be applied:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>
    If two requests request the same action, 
    i.e., the same Request and FPath values, 
    then the local request SHALL be considered to have a higher priority 
    than the remote request.
    </t>
    <t>
    When the highest local request comes to the PSC Control Logic, 
    if the remote request that requests a different action exists, 
    then the highest local request SHALL be ignored 
    and the remote request SHALL remain to be the top-priority global request. 
    In the case of an  MS command, the local MS command requesting 
    a different action SHALL be cancelled.
    </t>
    <t>
    When the remote request comes to the PSC Control Logic, 
    if the highest local request that requests a different action exists, 
    then the top-priority global request SHALL be determined by 
    the following rules: 
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>
      For MS requests, the MS-W request SHALL be considered to have 
      a higher priority than the MS-P request.
      The node that has the local MS-W request SHALL maintain 
      the local MS-W request as the top-priority global request. 
      The other node that has the local MS-P request SHALL cancel the MS-P command 
      and SHALL generate "Operator Clear" internally 
      as the top-priority global request.
      </t>
      <t>
      For SD requests, the SD on the standby path (the path from which 
      the selector does not select the user data traffic) SHALL be
      considered to have a higher priority than the SD on the
      active path (the path from which the selector selects the
      user data traffic) regardless of its origin (local or remote
      message).  
      The node that has the SD on the standby path SHALL maintain the local SD 
      on the standby path request as the top-priority global request. 
      The other node that has local SD on the active path SHALL use 
      the remote SD on the standby path as the top-priority global request 
      to lookup the state transition table.  
      The differentiation of the active and standby paths is based upon 
      which path had been selected for the user data traffic 
      when each node detected its local SD.

   In APS mode, provisioning mismatches are handled as follows:
   <list style="symbols">
    <t>If the PSC message is received from the working path 
    due to working/protection path configuration mismatch,
    the node MUST alert the operator
    and MUST NOT perform any protection switching   
    until the operator resolves this path configuration mismatch.
    </t>
    <t>In the case that the mismatch happens in the two-bit "Protection Type (PT)" 
    field, which indicates permanent/selector bridge type 
    and uni/bidirectional switching type:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>If the value of the PT field of one side is 2 (i.e., selector bridge) 
      and that of the other side is 1 or 3 
      (i.e., permanent bridge), then this event MUST be notified to 
      the operator and each node MUST NOT perform any protection switching 
      until the operator resolves this bridge type mismatch.
      </t>
      <t>If the bridge type matches but the switching type mismatches, 
      i.e., one side has PT=1 (unidirectional switching) 
      while the other side has PT=2 or 3 (bidirectional switching), 
      then the node provisioned for bidirectional switching SHOULD 
      fall back to unidirectional switching to allow interworking. 
      The node SHOULD notify the operator of this event.
      </t>
    </list>
    </t>
    <t>If the "Revertive (R)" bit mismatches, 
    two sides will interwork and traffic is protected according to 
    the state transition definition given in <xref target="secStateMachine"/>.
    The node SHOULD notify the operator of this event.
    </t>
    <t>If the Capabilities TLV mismatches, 
    the node MUST alert the operator 
    and MUST NOT perform any protection switching
    until the operator resolves the mismatch in the Capabilities TLV.
    </t>

     <t>
      No match in sent "Data Path (Path)" and received "Data Path (Path)" 
      for more than 50 ms: 
      The node MAY continue to perform protection switching 
      and SHOULD notify the operator of this event. 
     </t>
     <t>
      No PSC message is received on the protection path 
      during at least 3.5 times the long PSC message interval 
      (e.g., at least 17.5 seconds with a default message interval of 5 seconds),
      and there is no defect on the protection path: 
      The node MUST alert the operator and 
      MUST NOT perform any protection switching

   Each end is in the Normal state and transmits NR(0,0) messages.

   <t>
   When a FS command is issued at node Z, 
   node Z goes into local Protecting Administrative state (PA:F:L) 
   and begins transmission of an FS(1,1) message.
   </t>
   <t>
   A remote FS message causes node A to go into remote 
   Protecting Administrative state (PA:F:R), and node A begins transmitting 
   NR(0,1) messages.
   </t>
   <t>
   When node A detects a unidirectional SF-P, 
   node A keeps sending an NR(0,1) message because SF-P is ignored 
   under the PA:F:R state.
   </t>
   <t>
   When a Clear command is issued at node Z, 
   node Z goes into the Normal state and 
   begins transmission of NR(0,0) messages.
   </t>
   <t>
    But, node A cannot receive PSC message because of local unidirectional 
   SF-P. 
   Because no valid PSC message is received over a period of 
   several successive message intervals, 
   the last valid received message remains applicable,
   and the node A continue to transmit an NR(0,1) message 
   in the PA:F:R state.
   </t>

   <t>
   Now, there exists a mismatch between the selector and bridge positions of node A 
   (transmitting an NR(0,1) message) and node Z (transmitting an NR(0,0) message). 
   It results in an out-of-service situation even when there is neither SF-W nor FS.

    Each end is in the Normal state and transmits NR(0,0) messages.
    </t>
    <t>
    When SF-P occurs, 
     each node enters into the UA:P:L state and transmits SF(0,0) messages. 
     Traffic remains on the working path.
    </t>
    <t>
    When SF-W occurs, 
    each node remains in the UA:P:L state as SF-W has a lower priority 
    than SF-P. 
    Traffic is still on the working path. 
    Traffic cannot be delivered, as both the working path and 
    the protection path are 
    experiencing signal fails.
    </t>
    <t>
    When SF-P is cleared, the
      local "Clear SF-P" request cannot be presented to the PSC Control Logic, 
       which takes the highest local request and runs the PSC state machine, 
      since the priority of "Clear SF-P" is lower than that of SF-W. 
      Consequently, there is no change in state, 
      and the selector and/or bridge keep pointing at the working path, 
      which has SF condition.
      </t>
 </list>
</t>
      <t>
   Now, traffic cannot be delivered while the protection path is recovered 
   and available. It should be noted that the same problem will occur 
   in the case that the sequence of SF-P and SF-W events is changed.
      </t>
      <t>
   If we further continue with this sequence to see what will happen 
   after SF-W is cleared:

<list style="format (%d)" counter="appB">
      <t>
    When SF-W is cleared, the 
   local "Clear SF-W" request can be passed to the PSC Control Logic,
   as there is no higher-priority local input, 
   but it will be ignored in the PSC Control Logic 
   according to the state transition definition in <xref target="RFC6378"/>. 
   There will be no change in state or protocol message transmitted.
      </t>
</list>
      </t>
      <t>
   As SF-W is now cleared
   and the selector and/or bridge are still pointing at the working path, 
   traffic delivery is resumed. 
   However, each node is in the UA:P:L state and transmitting SF(0,0) messages, 
   while there exists no outstanding request for protection switching. 
   Moreover, any future legitimate protection-switching requests, 
   such as SF-W, will be rejected as each node 
   thinks the protection path is unavailable.

 </section>

 <section anchor="secFreeze" title="Freeze Command">
   <t>The "Freeze" command applies only to the local node of the
   protection group and is not signaled to the remote node.
   This command freezes the state of the protection group.
   Until the Freeze is cleared, additional local commands are
   rejected, and condition changes and received PSC information are
   ignored.  
   </t>

   <t>The "Clear Freeze" command clears the local freeze.  
   When the Freeze command is cleared, the state of the
   protection group is recomputed based on the persistent condition 
   of the local triggers.
   </t>

   <t>Because the freeze is local, if the freeze is issued at one end
   only, a failure of protocol can occur as the other end is open to
   accept any operator command or a fault condition.

 <section anchor="secExAPS" title="Operation Examples of the APS Mode">
  <t> 
   The sequence diagrams shown in this section are only a few examples
   of the APS mode operations. The first PSC protocol message that
   differs from the previous message is shown. 
   The operation of the hold-off timer is omitted. 
   The Request, FPath, and Path fields
   whose values are changed during PSC message exchange are shown. 
   For an example, SF(1,0) represents a PSC message with 
   the following field values:
   Request=SF, FPath=1, and Path=0. 
   The values of the other fields remain unchanged from the initial
   configuration. 
   W(A->Z) and P(A->Z) indicate the working path and the protection path 
   in the direction of A to Z, respectively.

    Each end is in the Normal state and transmits NR(0,0) messages.
   </t>
   <t>
    When SF-W occurs, 
   each node enters into the PF:W:L state and transmits SF(l,l) messages. 
   Traffic is switched to the protection path.
   Upon receiving an SF(1,1) message, each node confirms that the remote node is also
   sending and receiving the traffic on the protection path.
   </t>
   <t>
    When SF-W is cleared, 
   each node transits to the PF:W:R state and transmits NR(0,1) messages
   as the last received message is SF-W.
   </t>
   <t>
    Upon receiving NR(0,1) messages, 
   node A goes into the WTR state, starts the WTR timer, 
   and sends WTR(0,1) messages.
   At the same time, node Z transits to the DNR state 
   and sends a DNR(0,1) message.
   </t>
   <t>
    When the WTR message arrives at node Z, 
   node Z transits to the WTR state and sends an NR(0,1) message 
   according to the state transition table.
   At the same time, the DNR message arrived at node Z is ignored 
   according to the state transition table.
   Therefore, node Z, which is configured as non-revertive operation, is 
   operating as if in revertive operation.
   </t> 
   <t>
    Upon expiration of the WTR timer in node A, node A sends an NR(0,1) message.
   </t>
   <t>
   When the NR(0,1) message arrives at node Z, node Z moves to the Normal
   state, sets both the selector and bridge to the working path, 
   and sends an NR(0,0) message.
   </t>
   <t>
    The received NR(0,0) message causes node A to transit to 
   the Normal state.
   Now, the traffic is switched back to the working path.
