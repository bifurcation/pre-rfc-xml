<abstract>
  <t>
This document describes a method for displaying downgraded messages
that originally contained internationalized email addresses or
internationalized header fields.
  </t>
</abstract>
</front>

<middle>
<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
	<t>
	The Email Address Internationalization (UTF8SMTP) extension document set
	<xref target="RFC4952" />
	<xref target="RFC5336" />
	<xref target="RFC5335" />
	<xref target="RFC5337" />
	expands Email address structure, syntax, and email header format.
	To avoid rejection of internationalized email messages,
	the downgrading mechanism <xref target="RFC5504" />
	converts an internationalized message to a traditional email message
	when a server in the delivery path does not support the UTF8SMTP extension.
	The downgraded message is a traditional email message,
	except the message has "Downgraded-" header fields.
	</t>
	<t>
	A perfect reverse-function of the downgrading does not exist
	because the encoding defined in <xref target="RFC2047" /> is not exactly reversible
	and "Received" header field downgrading may remove FOR clause information.
	The restoration of the downgrading should be done once at the final
	destination of the downgraded message such as Mail User Agents (MUAs) or IMAP servers.
	This document describes the restoration methods for displaying downgraded messages
	in MUAs.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="Terminology">
  <t>
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
	"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
    in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
    2119 <xref target="RFC2119" />.
  </t>
  <t>
 Specialized terms used in this specification are defined in the
 EAI overview <xref target="RFC4952" /> or in
	<xref target="RFC5321" />, <xref target="RFC5322" />, or the
	MIME documents
		<xref target="RFC2045" />,
		<xref target="RFC2047" />,
		<xref target="RFC2183" />, and
		<xref target="RFC2231" />.
  </t>
  <t>
	This document depends on
	<xref target="RFC5335" /> and
	<xref target="RFC5504" />.
	Key words used in those documents are used in this document, too.
  </t>
  <t>
	The term "MIME decode" is used for both "encoded-word" decoding defined by <xref target="RFC2047" /> and
	MIME parameter value decoding defined by <xref target="RFC2231" />.
  </t>
</section>

<section title="Converting Downgraded Message Headers for Display" anchor="converting">
  <section title="Considerations" anchor="considerations">
    <t>
	The order of some header fields (such as "Resent-*" fields) is
	significant.  The process of regenerating the original fields
	from the downgraded ones MUST NOT reorder the fields.
    </t>
    <t>
	In order to regenerate a field from a specific downgraded
	header field, it's necessary to find the corresponding
	replacement in the current message.  If the corresponding
	field cannot be found, the downgraded header field in
	question cannot be regenerated and used.
    </t>

<t>   In any case where reconstruction of a particular downgraded header
field fails, both header fields (the "downgraded-YYY" header field and
the "YYY" header field) SHOULD be left in the message as they are.
The MUA MAY choose to communicate the situation to the user (see
the "Security Considerations" section). </t>

  </section>
  <section title="The Process" anchor="process">
    <t>
	A MUA MAY decode and regenerate the original header fields of
	the message (Mail Transport Agents (MTAs) and Mail Delivery Agents (MDAs) SHOULD NOT attempt to do this; it
	SHOULD be left to the MUA).  This procedure can be used to
	approximately reverse the downgrade process, but it will not
	always construct the original header fields exactly.
    </t>
    <t>
	Three types of downgraded header fields are described in Section 3
	of <xref target="RFC5504" />:
  <list style="numbers">
	  <t>"Envelope Information Preservation Header Fields", described in RFC5504 Section 3.1 and in <xref target="envelope-preservation"/>, below.</t>
	  <t>"Address Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields", described in RFC5504 Section 3.2 and in <xref target="address-preservation"/>, below.</t>
	  <t>"Unknown Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields", described in RFC5504 Section 3.3 and in <xref target="unknown-preservation"/>, below.</t>
	</list>
    </t>
    <t>
	After processing downgraded header fields, decode all header fields, as described in <xref target="RFC2047"/> and <xref target="RFC2231"/>.
    </t>
    <section title="No Reconstruction of the Envelope Information Preservation Header Fields" anchor="envelope-preservation">
	<t>
	  Envelope information preservation header fields are new
	  fields that might have been added by the downgrade process.
	  Because they do not represent fields that appeared in the
	  original message, this process is not applicable to them.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Reconstructing the Address Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields" anchor="address-preservation">
	<t>
	  Reconstructing address header fields' preservation header fields is OPTIONAL, and
	  a decision MAY be made on each field, individually.  In particular, it might be less
	  important to process the "Resent-*" header fields, so an implementation MAY choose to
	  skip those.
	</t>
	<t>
	  To construct a displayable copy of a header field from one
	  of these downgraded header fields, follow this procedure:
        <list style="numbers">

	      <t>In an edit buffer, create a new header field:
	    </t>
	    <list style="format (%c)"><t>
	      For the field name, remove the "Downgraded-" prefix from
	      the downgraded field name.  For example,
	      "Downgraded-From" becomes "From", and
	      "Downgraded-Resent-To" becomes "Resent-To".
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      For the field value, decode the MIME-encoded value of
	      the downgraded field according to <xref target="RFC2047"
	      />.
	    </t>
         </list>
<!-- [fujiwara] This part contained a problem. I fixed this section.
              Please check co-author, chairs, AD.
   Original Text was:
	      Apply "Email Header Fields Downgrading", defined in
	      Section 5 of <xref target="RFC5504"/>, to the field in
	      the edit buffer, but do not prepend the "Downgraded-"
	      prefix.  Put the result into comparison buffer 1.
   Reason:
            "Email Header Fields Downgrading" Generates
	       two header fields.
               downgraded ASCII header field and Address Header Fields' Preservation Header Field.
	       This process's purpose is removing downgraded ASCII header field in step 8.
-->
	    <t>
	      Apply "Email Header Fields Downgrading", defined in
	      Section 5 of <xref target="RFC5504"/>, to the field in
	      the edit buffer.
	      The process generates two header fields,
	      one is ASCII header field and
	      the other is the Address Header Fields' Preservation Header Field.
	      Put the generated ASCII header field into comparison buffer 1.
	    </t>
<!-- [fujiwara] end -->
	    <t>
<!-- [fujiwara] replaced "the header fields" as "the header field"
               replaced "comparison buffer" as "comparison buffer 1" -->
	      Canonicalize the header field in the comparison buffer 1:
	      <list style="numbers">
		<t>
		  Unfold all header field continuation lines as
		  described in <xref target="RFC5322" />.
		</t>
		<t>
		  Ensure that there is one space character before and
		  one after the &lt;mailbox-list&gt; separator ",".
		  If a space character is missing, insert one.
		</t>
		<t>
		  Ensure that there is one space character before and
		  one after each &lt;comment&gt;.  If a space character is
		  missing, insert one.
		</t>
		<t>
		  Decode each &lt;encoded-word&gt; whose charset is "UTF-8".
		</t>
		<t>
		  Convert all sequences of one or more WSP characters
		  to a single space character.  WSP characters here
		  include those before and after a line-folding
		  boundary.
		</t>
		<t>
		  Delete all WSP characters at the end of each unfolded header
		  field value.
		</t>
		<t>
		  Delete any WSP characters remaining before and after
		  the colon separating the header field name from the
		  header field value, retaining the colon separator.
		</t>
	      </list>
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Locate the first instance of the corresponding field in
	      the message's headers.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Canonicalize the located field as in step 3, and put the result
	      into comparison buffer 2.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Compare the header field in comparison buffer 1 with the header
	      field in comparison buffer 2.  If they match, go to step 8.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Locate the next instance of the corresponding field in
	      the message's headers.  If one is found, go to step 5.
	      If none is found, stop: you cannot use this downgraded
	      field because you can't find its replacement in the
	      message.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Replace the located header field with the one in the edit buffer.
	      You MUST NOT reorder the header fields when you do this; it's
	      important to replace the field in the same place.
<!-- [fujiwara]  I missed one procedure. Please review. -->
            Remove the target downgraded header field in the message header.
<!-- [fujiwara]  end. -->
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>
    </section>
    <section title="The Unknown Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields" anchor="unknown-preservation">
	<t>
	  The unknown header fields' preservation header fields SHOULD be
	  left as they are unless the MUA has special knowledge of a particular field.
	  An MUA with such knowledge MAY use the procedure similar to the procedure in <xref target="address-preservation"/>,
	  above, for those fields about which it knows.  (Note that the whitespace canonicalization
rule might not be applicable to some header fields.)
  </t>
    </section>
  </section>
</section>
<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
  <t>
 While information in any email header should usually be treated with
 some suspicion, current email systems commonly employ various
 mechanisms and protocols to make the information more trustworthy.
For example, an organization's boundary MTA can modify "From" lines
so that messages arriving from outside the organization are easily
distinguishable from internal emails.  As a result of that rewriting,
the "From" header field might not match the "Downgraded-From" header
field.
	</t>
  <t>
 A MUA MAY emphasize bogus or broken address header fields' preservation header fields found in step 7 of
 <xref target="address-preservation" />.
  </t>
  <t>
 Hiding the information from the actual header fields when using the
 "Downgraded-" header fields does not cause loss of information if
 generating MIME-decoded header fields in step 1
 of <xref target="address-preservation" />
 and
 the comparison done in step 7
 are successful.
 To ensure that no information is lost, a MUA
 SHOULD have a function that uses the actual message that was
 received (with/without MIME decoding) to render the message.
  </t>
  <t>
We have focused, here, on issues with displaying downgraded messages.
For more discussion of downgraded and internationalized messages in
general, see the "Security Considerations" section in <xref target="RFC5504" /> and <xref target="RFC4952" />.

  Apply "Email Header Fields Downgrading" to the "edit buffer". It generates downgraded ASCII header fields and
  the address header fields' preservation header fields. The latter fields are the same as the downgraded header fields.
  Put the formar fields into "comparison buffer 1".

	As a result, in this simple example, some original header fields are now displayed in their
	original form.
	Differences between <xref target="example-originaleaismtpsession" /> and <xref target="step8" /> are Return-Path, Downgraded-Mail-From, Downgraded-Rcpt-To, and Downgraded-Unknown-Field.
