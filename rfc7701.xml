      <t>The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) defines a
        mechanism for sending instant messages (IMs) within a peer-to-peer
        session, negotiated using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
        and the Session Description Protocol (SDP). This document
        defines the necessary tools for establishing multi-party
        chat sessions, or chat rooms, using MSRP.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

      <t>
        The <xref target="RFC4975">Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)
        </xref> defines a mechanism for sending a series of instant 
        messages within a session. The <xref target="RFC3261">
          Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)</xref> in
        combination with the <xref target="RFC4566">Session Description
          Protocol (SDP)</xref> allows for two peers to establish and manage
        such sessions.
      </t>

      <t>
        In another application of SIP, a User Agent (UA) can join in a
        multi-party conversation called a "conference" that is hosted 
        by a specialized UA called a "focus" 
        <xref target="RFC4353" />. Such a
        conference can naturally involve MSRP sessions. 
        It is the responsibility of an
        entity handling the media to relay IMs received from
        one participant to the rest of the participants in the
        conference.  
      </t>

      <t>
        Several such systems already exist in the
        Internet. Participants in a chat room can be identified with a
        pseudonym or nickname and can decide whether their real identifier is
        disclosed to other participants. Participants can also use a rich
        set of features such as the ability to send private instant
        messages to other participants. 
      </t>


      <t>
	Similar conferences supporting chat room functionality are already
	available today.  For example, <xref target="RFC2810">Internet
	Relay Chat (IRC)</xref>, <xref target="RFC6120">Extensible
	Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core</xref>, as well as many other proprietary systems.  Specifying equivalent functionality for
	MSRP-based systems eases interworking between these
	systems.
      </t>

      <t>
        This document defines requirements, conventions, and
        extensions for providing private messages and nickname
        management in centralized chat rooms with MSRP. Participants
        in a chat room can be identified by a pseudonym and decide if
        their real identifier should be disclosed to other participants. This
        memo uses the <xref target="RFC4353"> SIP Conferencing
        Framework</xref> as a design basis. It also aims to be
        compatible with <xref target="RFC5239">"A Framework for
        Centralized Conferencing"</xref>.  


Should requirements arise, future mechanisms for providing similar
functionality in generic conferences might be developed, for example,
where the media is not only restricted to MSRP. The mechanisms described
        in this document provide a future compatible short-term
        solution for MSRP centralized chat rooms. </t>

      <t>This memo deals with "Tightly Coupled SIP
        Conferences" as defined in <xref target="RFC4353"> 
        the SIP Conferencing Framework </xref> and adopts the terminology
	from that document. In addition, 
        we introduce some new terms:
        
        <list style="hanging">
          
          <t hangText="Nickname: "> a pseudonym or descriptive name
          associated with a participant. See <xref target="nicknames"/>
          for details. </t>
          
          <t hangText="Multi-party Chat: ">
            an instance of a tightly coupled conference, in which the media
            exchanged between the participants consist of MSRP-based IMs. Also known as a chat room.</t>          

          <t hangText="Chat Room: "> a synonym for a multi-party chat.</t>

          <t hangText="Chat Room URI: "> a URI that identifies a particular
            chat room and that is a synonym of a "Conference URI" as defined in

          <t hangText="Sender: "> the chat room participant who
            originally created an IM and sent it to the
	    chat room server for further delivery.</t>

          <t hangText="Recipient: "> the destination chat room
          participant(s). This defaults to the full conference
          participant list minus the IM Sender.</t>

          <t hangText="MSRP Switch: "> a media-level entity that is an
            MSRP endpoint. It is a special MSRP endpoint that receives
            MSRP messages and delivers them to the other chat room
            participants. The MSRP switch has a similar role to a conference
            mixer with the exception that the MSRP switch does not actually
            "mix" together different input media streams; it merely relays the
            messages between chat room participants.</t>

          <t hangText="Private IM: "> 
            an IM sent in a chat room intended for a
            single participant.  Generally speaking, a private IM is
	    seen by the MSRP switch, in addition to the sender and
	    recipient. A private IM is usually rendered
            distinctly from the rest of the IMs, indicating that the
            message was a private communication.
          </t>

          <t hangText="Anonymous URI:"> a URI concealing the
          participant's SIP address of record (AOR) from the other participants in the
          chat room. The allocation of such a URI is out of scope of
          this specification.  An anonymous URI must be valid for the
          length of the chat room session and will be utilized by the
          MSRP switch to forward messages to and from anonymous
          participants. Privacy and anonymity are discussed in greater

      <t>
        Although conference frameworks describing many types of
        conferencing applications already exist, such as the one in <xref
        target="RFC5239">"A Framework for Centralized Conferencing"</xref>
        and the <xref target="RFC4353">SIP Conferencing
        Framework</xref>, the exact details of session-based instant
        messaging conferences (chat rooms) are not well-defined at the
        moment.
      </t>

      <t>
        To allow interoperable chat implementations, for both
        conference-aware and conference-unaware UAs, certain
        conventions for MSRP chat rooms need to be defined. It also seems
        beneficial to provide a set of features that enhance the baseline
        multi-party MSRP in order to be able to create systems that have
        functionality on par with existing chat systems as well as to enable the
        building of interworking gateways to these existing chat systems.
      </t>

      <t>We define the following requirements:</t>

        <list style='format REQ-%d:'>
          
          <t>
            A basic requirement is the existence of a chat room, where
            participants can join and leave the chat room and exchange
            IMs with the rest of the
            participants.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            A recipient of an IM in a chat room must be
            able to determine the identifier of the sender of the
            message. Note that the actual identifier depends on the
            one that was used by the sender when joining the
            chat room.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            A recipient of an IM in a chat room must be
            able to determine the identifier of the recipient of
            received messages. For instance, the recipient of the
            message might be the entire chat room or a single
            participant (i.e., a private message). Note that the
            actual identifier may depend on the one that was used by
            the recipient when he or she joined the chat room.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            It must be possible to send a message to a single

          <t>
            A chat room participant may have a nickname or pseudonym

          <t>
            It must be possible for a participant to change their nickname

          </t>
          
          <t>
            It must be possible for a participant to be known only by an
            anonymous identifier and not their real identifier by the rest
            of the chat room.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            It must be possible for chat room participants to 
            learn the chat room capabilities described in this document.

    <section anchor="overview" title="Overview of Operation">
      
      <t>
        Before a chat room can be entered, it must be created. Users
        wishing to host a chat room themselves can, of course, do just
        that; their UA simply morphs from an ordinary UA
        into a special purpose one called a "Focus UA".  Another,
        commonly used setup is one where a dedicated node in the
        network functions as a Focus UA.
      </t>

      <t>
        Each chat room has an identifier of its own: a SIP URI that
        participants use to join the chat room, e.g., by sending an
        INVITE request to it. The conference focus processes the
        invitations, and as such, maintains SIP dialogs with each
        participant. In a multi-party chat, or chat room, MSRP is one
        of the established media streams. Each chat room participant
        establishes an MSRP session with the MSRP switch, which is a
        special purpose MSRP application. The MSRP sessions can be
        relayed by one or more MSRP relays, which are specified in
        <xref target="RFC4976">RFC 4976</xref>.  This is illustrated
        in <xref target="scenario" />.</t>

        The MSRP switch is similar to a
        conference mixer in that it both handles media sessions with each
        of the participants and bridges these streams together. However,
        unlike a conference mixer, the MSRP switch merely forwards
        messages between participants: it doesn't actually mix the
        streams in any way. The system is illustrated in 
        <xref target="arch" />.

      <t>
        Typically, chat room participants also subscribe to a
        conference event package to gather information about the
        conference roster in the form of conference state
        notifications.  For example, participants can learn about
        other participants' identifiers, including their nicknames.
      </t>

      <t>
        All messages in the chat room use the <xref
        target="RFC3862">Message/CPIM wrapper content type</xref>,
        to distinguish between private and
        regular messages. When a participant wants to send an instant
        message to the chat room, it constructs an MSRP SEND request
        and submits it to the MSRP switch including a regular payload
        (e.g., a Message/CPIM message that contains text, HTML, an
        image, etc.). The Message/CPIM To header is set to the chat
        room URI. The switch then fans out the SEND request to all of
        the other participants using their existing MSRP sessions.
      </t>

      <t>
        A participant can also send a private IM
        addressed to a participant whose identifier has been learned,
        e.g., via a conference event package.  In this case, the sender
        creates an MSRP SEND request with a Message/CPIM wrapper whose
        To header contains not the chat room URI but the recipient's
        URI. The MSRP switch then forwards the SEND request to that
        recipient. This specification supports the sending of private
        messages to one and only one recipient. However, if the
        recipient is logged in from different endpoints, the MSRP switch
        will distribute the private message to each endpoint at which the
        recipient is logged in.
      </t>

      <t>
        We extend the current MSRP negotiation that takes place in
        <xref target="RFC4566">SDP </xref> to allow participants to
        learn whether the chat room supports and is willing to accept
        (e.g., due to local policy restrictions) certain MSRP functions
        defined in this memo, such as nicknames or private
        messaging. This is achieved by a new 'chatroom' attribute in
        SDP (please refer to <xref target="chatroom-attribute"/> for a
	detailed description).
      </t>

      <t>
        Naturally, when a participant wishes to leave a chat room,
        it sends a SIP BYE request to the Focus UA and
        terminates the SIP dialog with the focus and MSRP sessions with
        the MSRP switch.
      </t>

      <t> 
	This document assumes that each chat room is allocated its own
	SIP URI. A user joining a chat room sends an INVITE request to
	that SIP URI, and, as a result, a new MSRP session is established
	between the user and the MSRP switch. It is assumed that an
	MSRP session is mapped to a chat room. If a user wants to join
	a second chat room, he creates a different INVITE request,
	through a different SIP dialog, which leads to the creation of
	a second MSRP session between the user and the MSRP
	switch. Notice that these two MSRP sessions can still be
	multiplexed over the same TCP connection as per regular MSRP
	procedures. However, each chat room is associated with a

	  The <xref target="RFC4353">Conference Framework with SIP

      <section anchor="creating" title="Creating a Chat Room">

        <t>
          Since we consider a chat room a particular type of
          conference having MSRP media, the methods defined by the
          <xref target="RFC4353" >SIP Conference Framework </xref> for
          creating conferences are directly applicable to a chat room.
        </t>

        <t>
          Once a chat room is created, it is identified by a SIP URI,
          like any other conference. 
        </t>

      </section>

      <section title="Joining a Chat Room" anchor="joining">

	<t>
	  Participants usually join the chat room by sending an INVITE
	  request to the chat room URI. The chat room then uses
	  regular SIP mechanisms to authenticate the participant. This
	  may include, e.g., client certificates, <xref
	  target="RFC3261">SIP Digest authentication </xref>, <xref
	  target="RFC3325">asserted network identity </xref>, <xref
	  target="RFC4474">SIP Identity header field </xref>, etc. As
	  long as the user is authenticated, the INVITE request is
	  accepted by the focus and the user is brought into the
	  actual chat room.
	</t>

	<t>
	  This specification requires all IMs to be
	  wrapped in a <xref target="RFC3862">Message/CPIM wrapper
	  </xref>. Therefore, the 'accept-types' attribute for the
	  MSRP message media in both the SDP offer and answer need to
	  include at least the value 'Message/CPIM' (notice that <xref
	  target="RFC4975">RFC 4975 </xref> mandates this
	  'accept-types' attribute in SDP). If the 'accept-types'
	  attribute does not contain the value 'Message/CPIM', the
	  conference focus will reject the request. The actual instant
	  message payload type is negotiated in the
	  'accept-wrapped-types' attribute in SDP (see <xref
	  target="RFC4975">RFC 4975 </xref> for details). There is no
	  default wrapped type. Typical wrapped type values can
	  include text/plain, text/html, image/jpeg, image/png,
	  audio/mp3, etc. It is RECOMMENDED that participant endpoints
	  add an 'accept-wrapped-types' attribute to the MSRP
	  'message' media line in SDP, where the supported wrapped
	  types are declared, as per <xref target="RFC4975">RFC 4975
	  procedures </xref>.
	</t>




        <t> 
	  The MSRP switch needs to be aware of the URIs of the
	  participant (SIP, tel, or IM URIs) in order to validate
	  messages sent from this participant prior to their
	  forwarding. This information is known to the focus of the
	  conference. Therefore, an interface between the focus and the
	  MSRP switch is assumed. However, the interface between the
	  focus and the MSRP switch is outside the scope of this
	  document.
	</t>


        <t>
          Conference-aware participants will detect that the peer is a
          focus due to the presence of <xref target="RFC3840"> the
          "isfocus" feature tag </xref> in the Contact header field of
          the 200-class response to the INVITE
          request. Conference-unaware participants will not notice it
          is a focus, and cannot apply the additional mechanisms
          defined in this document.  Participants are also aware that
          the mixer is an MSRP switch due to the presence of a
          'message' media type and either TCP/MSRP or TCP/TLS/MSRP as
          the protocol field in the media line of <xref
          target="RFC4566">SDP</xref>.
        </t>

        <t>
          The conference focus of a chat room MUST only use a <xref
          target="RFC3862">Message/CPIM</xref> top-level wrapper as a
          payload of MSRP messages, and the focus MUST declare it in
          the SDP offer or answer as per regular procedures in <xref
          target="RFC4975">RFC 4975 </xref>. This implies
          that if the conference focus receives, from a participant's
          endpoint, an SDP offer that does not include the value
          'Message/CPIM' in the 'accept-types' attribute for the MSRP
          message media line, the conference focus SHOULD either
          reject the MSRP message media stream or reject the complete SDP
          offer by using regular SIP or SDP procedures (e.g., creating
          an SDP answer that sets to zero the port of the MSRP message
          media line, responding the INVITE with a 488 response,
          etc.).
	</t>
	<t>
	  If the conference focus accepts the participant's SDP offer,
	  when the conference focus generates the SDP answer, it MUST
	  set the 'accept-types' attribute for the MSRP message media
	  line to a value of 'Message/CPIM'. This specification
	  requires all IMs to be wrapped in a
	  Message/CPIM wrapper, therefore, the 'accept-types'
	  attribute in this SDP body contains a single value of
	  'Message/CPIM'. The actual IM payload type is
	  negotiated in the 'accept-wrapped-types' attribute in SDP
	  (see <xref target="RFC4975">RFC 4975 </xref> for
	  details). The conference focus MAY also add an
	  'accept-wrapped-types' attribute to the MSRP message media
	  line in SDP containing the supported wrapped types,
	  according to the supported wrapped media types policy.

        <t>
	  The conference focus of a chat room learns the supported
	  chat room capabilities in the endpoint by means of the
	  'chatroom' attribute exchanged in the SDP offer/answer
	  (please refer to <xref target="chatroom-attribute"/> for a
	  detailed description). The conference focus MUST inform the
	  MSRP switch of the chat room capabilities of each participant
	  that joins the chat room (note that the interface defined
	  between the conference focus and the MSRP switch is outside
	  the scope of this specification). This information allows
	  the MSRP switch, e.g., to avoid the distribution of private
	  messages to participants whose endpoints do not support
	  private messaging.

      <section anchor="deleting-chatroom" title="Deleting a Chat Room">

        <t>
          As with creating a conference, the methods defined by the
          <xref target="RFC4353" >SIP Conference Framework</xref> 
          for deleting a conference are directly applicable to a chat 
          room.  The MSRP switch will terminate the MSRP sessions with
          all the participants. 
        </t>

        <t>
          Deleting a chat room is an action that heavily depends on the
          policy of the chat room. For example, the policy can determine whether the chat room is deleted
when the creator leaves the room or whether an out-of-band mechanism
is responsible for the deletion.

    <section title="Sending and Receiving Instant Messages" anchor="im">
      <section title="Regular Messages" anchor="regular">

        <t>
          This section describes the conventions used to send and receive
          IMs that are addressed to all the participants in the
          chat room. These are sent over a regular MSRP SEND request that
          contains a <xref target="RFC3862">Message/CPIM wrapper </xref>
          that, in turn, contains the desired payload (e.g., text, image,
          video clip, etc.).
        </t>

        <t>
          When a chat room participant wishes to send an instant
          message to all the other participants in the chat room, it
          constructs an MSRP SEND request according to the procedures
          specified in <xref target="RFC4975">RFC 4975</xref>. The
          sender MAY choose the desired MSRP report model (e.g.,
          populate the Success-Report and Failure-Report MSRP header
          fields).
	</t>
        <t>
	  On sending a regular message, the sender MUST populate the To
	  header of the Message/CPIM wrapper with the URI of the chat
	  room. The sender MUST also populate the From header of the
	  Message/CPIM wrapper with a proper identifier by which the
	  user is recognized in the chat room. Identifiers that can be
	  used (among others) are:
	</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
	    <t>A <xref target="RFC3261">SIP URI</xref> representing the
	      participant's address-of-record</t>
	    <t>A <xref target="RFC3966">tel URI</xref> representing the
	      participant's telephone number</t>
	    <t>An <xref target="RFC3860">IM URI</xref> representing the
	      participant's instant messaging address</t>
	    <t>An anonymous URI representing the participant's
	    anonymous address</t>
          </list>
        </t>

	<t>
	  If the participant wants to remain anonymous, the
	  participant's endpoint MUST populate an anonymous URI in the From
	  header of the Message/CPIM wrapper. Other participants of
	  the chat room will use this anonymous URI in the To header
	  of the Message/CPIM wrapper when sending private
	  messages. Notice that in order for the anonymity mechanism
	  to work, the anonymous URI MUST NOT reveal the participant's
	  SIP AOR. The mechanism for acquiring an anonymous URI is
	  outside the scope of this specification.
        </t>

        <t>
          An MSRP switch that receives a SEND request from a
          participant SHOULD first verify that the From header field
          of the Message/CPIM wrapper is correctly populated with a
          valid URI of a participant. This imposes a requirement for
          the focus of the conference to inform the MSRP switch of the
          URIs by which the participant is known, in order for the
          MSRP switch to validate messages. <xref target="reports"/>
          provides further information with the actions to be taken in
          case this validation fails.
        </t>

        <t>
          Then the MSRP switch should inspect the To header field of
          the Message/CPIM wrapper.  If the MSRP switch receives a
          message containing several To header fields in the
          Message/CPIM wrapper the MSRP switch MUST reject the MSRP
          SEND request with a 403 response, as per procedures in <xref
          target="RFC4975">RFC 4975</xref>. Then, if the To header
          field of the Message/CPIM wrapper contains the chat room URI
          and there are no other To header fields, the MSRP switch can
          generate a copy of the SEND request to each of the
          participants in the chat room except the sender. The MSRP
          switch MUST NOT modify the content received in the SEND
          request. However, the MSRP switch MAY re-chunk any of the
          outbound MSRP SEND requests.
	</t>


	<t>
	  When generating a copy of the SEND request to each
	  participant in the chat room, the MSRP switch MUST evaluate
	  the wrapped media types that the recipient is able to
	  accept. This was learned through the 'accept-wrapped-types'
	  attribute of the MSRP message media line in SDP. If the MSRP
	  switch is aware that the media type of the wrapped content
	  is not acceptable to the recipient, the MSRP switch SHOULD
	  NOT forward this message to that endpoint. Note that this
	  version of the specification does not require the MSRP
	  switch to notify the sender about this failure. Extensions
	  to this specification may improve handling of unknown media
	  types.
	</t>

        <!--- Chunked messages -->
	<t>
	  Note that the MSRP switch does not need to wait for the
	  reception of the complete MSRP chunk or MSRP message before
	  it starts the distribution to the rest of the
	  participants. Instead, once the MSRP switch has received the
	  headers of the Message/CPIM wrapper, it SHOULD start the
	  distribution process. But, bear in mind that the MSRP
	  switch SHOULD still implement some sanity checking. Please refer
	  to the security considerations in <xref target="security" />
	  for further details.
	</t>
	<t>
	  When forwarding chunked messages as soon as they are
	  received, the Message/CPIM wrapper is only present at the
	  beginning of the message, typically within the first
	  chunk. Subsequent chunks will contain the rest of the
	  message, but not the Message/CPIM headers. Therefore, an
	  MSRP switch that receives a subsequent message may face
	  challenges in determining the correct list of recipients of
	  the message. An MSRP switch that uses this fast forwarding
	  procedure MUST temporarily store the Message-ID of the MSRP
	  message to correlate the different chunks; it
	  MUST also temporarily store the list of recipients to which the
	  initial chunks were delivered. The MSRP switch SHOULD
	  forward subsequent chunks only to those recipients who were
	  sent the initial chunks, except if the MSRP switch has
	  knowledge that one of the recipients of the initial chunks
	  has dropped from the chat room. This behavior also avoids
	  new participants who had joined the chat room when the first
	  chunk was distributed from receiving subsequent chunks that
	  would otherwise need to be discarded.
        </t>
	<t>
	  Once the MSRP switch receives the last chunk of a message,
	  and that chunk is successfully sent to each of the
	  recipients, the MSRP switch discards the temporary
	  storage of MSRP Message-ID and the associated list of
	  recipients. 
	</t>

	<t>
	  In some occasions, a sender might suffer a transport error
	  condition (such as loss of connectivity or depletion of
	  battery) that makes the sending of a message incomplete,
	  e.g., some chunks were received by the MSRP switch, but not
	  all of them. This is a behavior already considered in the
	  core MSRP specification (see <xref target="RFC4975"> RFC
	  4975 </xref> Section 5.4). The problem in the context of a
	  chat room lies with the use of temporary storage for fast
	  forwarding. In order to prevent attacks related to the
	  exhaustion of temporary storage of chunked messages, on
	  receiving a first chunk of a message, where the MSRP switch
	  is using the fast forward method, the MSRP switch MUST set a
	  chunk reception timer for controlling the reception of the
	  remaining chunks.
	</t>
	<t>
	  This chunk reception timer can be reset every time a new
	  chunk of the same message is received. When this timer
	  expires, the MSRP switch MUST consider that the sending of the
	  message was aborted, and it MAY discard all the message state
	  associated with it, including the Message-ID and the list of
	  recipients. Additionally, if this chunk reception timer
	  expires, the MSRP switch MAY choose to send an abort chunk
	  (i.e., one with the "#" flag set) to each to the
	  recipients. This is just an optimization, since MSRP
	  endpoints need to be able to handle incomplete messages as
	  per regular MSRP.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The specific value of this chunk reception timer is not
	  standardized; it is subject of local policy. However, it is
	  recommended not to be a short value. For example, a time interval
	  on the order of a normal TCP timeout (i.e., around 540
	  seconds) would be reasonable. A value on the order of a few
	  seconds would not.
	</t>
        <t>
          An MSRP endpoint that receives a SEND request from the MSRP
          switch containing a Message/CPIM wrapper SHOULD first
          inspect the To header field of the Message/CPIM wrapper. If
          the To header field is set to the chat room URI, it should
          render it as a regular message that has been distributed to
          all the participants in the chat room. Then, the MSRP
          endpoint SHOULD inspect the From header field of the
          Message/CPIM wrapper to identify the sender. The From header
          field will include a URI that identifies the sender. The
          endpoint might have also received further identifier
          information through a subscription to a conference event
          package. 
        </t>

  
        <t>
          It is possible that a participant, identified by a SIP
          AoR or other valid URI, joins a chat room
          simultaneously from two or more different SIP UAs. It is
          recommended that the MSRP switch implements means to map a
          URI to two or more MSRP sessions.  If the policy of the chat
          room allows simultaneous access, the MSRP switch MUST copy
          all regular messages intended to the recipient through each
          MSRP session mapped to the recipient's URI.
        </t>

      <section title="Private Messages" anchor="private-messages">

        <t>
          This section describes the conventions used to send and
          receive private IMs, i.e., IMs
          that are addressed to one participant of the chat room
          rather than to all of them. The chat room has a local policy that
          determines whether or not private messages are supported. A
          chat room can signal support for private messages using the
          'chatroom' attribute in SDP (please refer to <xref
          target="chatroom-attribute"/> for a detailed description).
        </t>

        <t>
          When a chat room participant wishes to send a private
          IM to a participant in the chat room, it
          follows the same procedures to create a SEND request as
          for <xref target="regular"> regular messages </xref>.  The
          only difference is that the MSRP endpoint MUST populate a
          single To header of the Message/CPIM wrapper with the
          identifier of the intended recipient.  The identifier can be
          SIP, tel, and im URIs typically learned from the information
          received in notifications of a conference event package.

	      This version of the specification does not support
	      sending a private message to multiple recipients, i.e.,

	      wrapper of the MSRP SEND request. This is due to added
	      complexity, for example, with the need to determine
	      whether a message was not delivered to some of the

	      recreate this function can send a series of single
	      private messages, one private message per intended

          populated with a valid URI (i.e., the URI is a participant
          of this chat room). <xref target="reports"/> provides further
	  information regarding the actions to be taken in case this
	  validation fails.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Then, the MSRP switch inspects the To header field of the
	  Message/CPIM wrapper. If the MSRP switch receives a message
	  containing several To header fields in the Message/CPIM
	  wrapper, the MSRP switch MUST reject the MSRP SEND request
	  with a 403 response, as per procedures in <xref
	  target="RFC4975">RFC 4975</xref>. Then, the MSRP switch 
	  verifies that the To header of the Message/CPIM wrapper
	  matches the URI of a participant of the chat room. If this
	  To header field does not contain the URI of a participant of
	  the chat room or if the To header field cannot be resolved
	  (e.g., caused by a mistyped URI), the MSRP switch MUST
	  reject the request with a 404 response. This new 404 status
	  code indicates a failure to resolve the recipient URI in the
	  To header field of the Message/CPIM wrapper.
	</t>

        <t>
	  <list style="empty">
	    <t>
	    Notice the importance of the From and To headers in the
	    Message/CPIM wrapper. If an intermediary modifies these
	    values, the MSRP switch might not be able to identify the
	    source or intended destination of the message, resulting
	    in a rejection of the message.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>


	<t>
	  Finally, the MSRP switch verifies that the recipient
	  supports private messages. If the recipient does not support
	  private messages, the MSRP switch MUST reject the request
	  with a 428 response.  This new 428 response indicates that
	  the recipient does not support private messages.  Any
	  potential REPORT request that the MSRP switch sends to the
	  sender MUST include a Message/CPIM wrapper containing the
	  original From header field included in the SEND request and
	  the To header field of the original Message/CPIM wrapper.
	  The MSRP switch MUST NOT forward private messages to a
	  recipient that does not support private messaging.
	</t>
	<t>
	  If successful, the MSRP switch should search its mapping
	  table to find the MSRP sessions established toward the
	  recipient.  If a match is found, the MSRP switch MUST create
	  a SEND request and MUST copy the contents of the sender's
	  message to it. 
        </t>
        
        <t>
          An MSRP endpoint that receives a SEND request from the MSRP
          switch does the same validations as for <xref
          target="regular"> regular messages </xref>.  If the To
          header field is different from the chat room URI, the MSRP
          endpoints know that this is a private message.  The
          endpoint should render who it is from based on the value of
          the From header of the Message/CPIM wrapper. The endpoint can also use the sender's nickname, possibly learned
via a conference event package, to render the sender of the message, instead of using the sender's actual URI.


	</t>

        
        <t>
          As with regular messages, if the policy of the chat room
	  allows simultaneous access, the MSRP switch
          MUST copy all private messages intended to the recipient through
          each MSRP session mapped to the recipient's URI.

       <t>
	  If the MSRP switch receives an MSRP SEND request that does

       <t>
	  If the MSRP switch receives an MSRP SEND request where the

	  the sender of the message or is not a valid participant of

        <t>
	  When the MSRP switch forwards a SEND request,  it MAY use any

          forwarded to the originator of the original SEND request.
          This could lead to having the sender receiving multiple

      <section anchor="congestion" title="Congestion Avoidance">

	<t>
	  Congestion can occur when multiple heterogeneous interfaces
	  are used by a number of users who are participating in a
	  chat room, and, in particular, when paths become overloaded
	  by any application. Some of these users might have fast paths
	  capable of high throughputs while other users might be slow
	  paths with constrained throughputs. Some paths might become
	  congested only by the chat application; other paths gets
	  congested by other applications. Therefore, it is possible that a subset of the
	  participants of the chat room are able to send and receive a
	  large number of messages in a short time or with large
	  contents (e.g., pictures), whereas others are not able to
	  keep up the pace.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Additionally, since MSRP uses a connection-oriented
	  transport protocol such as TCP, it is expected that TCP
	  congestion control mechanisms be activated if congestion
	  occurs. Details on congestion control are specified in <xref
	  target="RFC5681">RFC 5681</xref>.
	</t>
	<t>
	  While this document does not mandate a particular
	  MSRP-specific mechanism to avoid congestion in any of the
	  paths, something that is deemed outside the scope of this
	  document, this document provides some recommendations for
	  implementors to consider.
	</t>
	<t>
	  It is RECOMMENDED that MSRP switches implement one or more
	  MSRP-specific strategies to detect and avoid
	  congestion. Possible strategies (but definitely not a
	  comprehensive list) include:
	</t>
	<t>
	  <list style="symbols">
	    <t>If the MSRP switch is writing data to a send buffer and
	    detects that the send buffer associated with that TCP
	    connection is getting full (e.g., close to 80% of its
	    capacity), the MSRP switch marks the associated MSRP
	    sessions making use of that TCP connection as "congested".
	    </t>

	    <t>Prior to sending a new MSRP message to a user, the MSRP
	    switch verifies the congested flag associated to that MSRP
	    session. If the MSRP session is marked as congested, the
	    MSRP switch can apply a congestion avoidance mechanism,
	    such as:


	      <list style="symbols">
		<t>
		  The MSRP switch MAY discard regular MSRP messages
		  sent to that user while the congestion flag is
		  raised for the user's TCP connection. In order to
		  inform the user of the congestion, the MSRP switch
		  MAY send a regular MSRP message to the user whose
		  congestion flag is raised. This message indicates
		  that some other messages are being discarded due to
		  network congestion. However, it should be noted that
		  this message can get stuck at MSRP switch, if the
		  path is fully congested, i.e., it may not be
		  delivered anyhow.
		</t>
		<t>
		  The MSRP can implement a temporary policy to
		  disallow the distribution of messages larger than a
		  certain size to MSRP sessions marked as
		  congested. Similarly, the user should be informed of
		  this fact by the MSRP switch sending a regular MSRP
		  message indicating this condition.
		</t>
	      </list>
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      If the MSRP switch determines that the congestion flag
	      associated with a given TCP connection has been raised for
	      quite some time (on the order of a few minutes), or if
	      the interface is down, this may be considered an
	      indication that the TCP connection has not been able to
	      recover from a congestion state. The MSRP switch MAY
	      close this congested TCP connection as well as the MSRP
	      session and SIP session.

    <section anchor="nicknames" title="Nicknames">

      <t>
        A common characteristic of existing chat room services is
        that participants have the ability to present themselves with
        a nickname to the rest of the participants of the
        chat room. It is used for easy reference of participants 
        in the chat room and can also provide anonymous participants 
        with a meaningful descriptive name.
      </t>



      <t>
        A nickname is a useful construct in many use cases, of which
        MSRP chat is but one example. A nickname is associated with a URI; the focus knows
the participant by its association to this URI. Therefore, if a
        user joins the chat room under the same URI from multiple
        devices, he or she may request the same nickname across all
        these devices. 
      </t>


      <t>
        A nickname is a user-selectable moniker by which the
        participant wants to be known to the other participants. It is
        not a 'display-name', but it is used somewhat like a display
        name.  A main difference is that a nickname is unique inside a
        chat room to allow an unambiguous reference to a participant
        in the chat.  Nicknames may be long lived, or they may be
        temporary.  Users also need to reserve a nickname prior to its
        utilization.
      </t>
      
      <t> 
        This memo specifies the nickname as a string.  The nickname
        string MUST unambiguously be associated with a single user in
        the scope of the chat room (conference instance).  This scope
        is similar to having a nickname unique per user inside a chat
        room from <xref target="RFC6120">"Extensible Messaging and
        Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core"</xref>. The chat room may have policies
        associated with nicknames.  It may not accept nickname strings
        at all, or it may provide a wider unambiguous scope like a
        domain or server, similar to <xref target="RFC2810">IRC</xref>.
      </t>

      
      <section title="Using Nicknames within a Chat Room"
	       anchor="using-nicknames" >
        
        <t> 
          This memo provides a mechanism to reserve a nickname for a
          participant for as long as the participant is logged into
          the chat room.  The mechanism is based on a NICKNAME MSRP
          method (see below) and a new "Use-Nickname" header. Note
          that other mechanisms may exist (for example, a web page
          reservation system), although they are outside the scope of
          this document.
        </t>
        
        <t>
          A chat room participant who has established an MSRP session
          with the MSRP switch, where the MSRP switch has indicated
          the support and availability of nicknames with the
          'nicknames' token in the 'chatroom' SDP attribute, MAY send
          a NICKNAME request to the MSRP switch. The NICKNAME request
          MUST include a new Use&nbhy;Nickname header that contains
          the nickname string that the participant wants to
          reserve. This nickname string MUST NOT be zero octets in
          length and MUST NOT be more than 1023 octets in
          length. Finally, MSRP NICKNAME requests MUST NOT include
          Success-Report or Failure-Report header fields.
	</t>

	<t><list style="empty">
	  <t>
	   Bear in mind that nickname strings, like the rest of the
	   MSRP message, use the <xref target="RFC3629"> UTF-8
	   transformation format </xref>. Therefore, a character may
	   be encoded in more than one octet.
	  </t>
	</list></t>

        <t>
          An MSRP switch that receives a NICKNAME request containing
          a Use&nbhy;Nickname header field SHOULD
          first verify whether the policy of the chat room allows the
          nickname functionality. If not allowed, the MSRP switch
          MUST reject the request with a 403 response, as per <xref
          target="RFC4975">RFC 4975</xref>.
        </t>

	
	
	<t>
	  If the policy of the chat room allows the usage of
          nicknames, any new nickname requested MUST be prepared and 
	  compared with nicknames already in use or reserved 
	  following the rules defined in  
	  <xref target="RFC7700">"Preparation, Enforcement, and
	  Comparison of Internationalized Strings Representing Nicknames"</xref>. 
	</t>
	<t>
	  This mitigates the problem of nickname duplication, but it
	  does not solve a problem whereby users can choose similar
	  (but different) characters to represent two different
	  nicknames. For example, "BOY" and "B0Y" are different
	  nicknames that can mislead users. The former uses the
	  capital letter "O" while the latter uses the number zero
	  "0". In many fonts, the letter "O" and the number zero "0"
	  might be quite similar and difficult to perceive as
	  different characters. Chat rooms MAY provide a mechanism to
	  mitigate confusable nicknames.
	</t>
        <t>
          In addition to preparing and comparing following the rules
          above, the MSRP switch SHOULD only allow the reservation of
          an already-used nickname if the same user (e.g., identified
          by the SIP AOR) that is currently using the nickname is
          making this subsequent request. This may include, e.g.,
          allowing the participant's URI to use the same
          nickname when the participant has joined the chat room from
          different devices under the same URI. The participant's
          authenticated identifier can be derived after a successful
          <xref target="RFC3261">SIP Digest Authentication </xref>, 
          included in a trusted <xref target="RFC3325">SIP
          P-Asserted-Identity header field </xref>, included in a
          valid <xref target="RFC4474">SIP Identity header field
          </xref>, or derived from any other present or future SIP
          authentication mechanism.  Once the MSRP switch has
          validated that the participant is entitled to reserve the
          requested nickname, the MSRP switch verifies if the
          suggested nickname can be accepted (see below).
        </t>

        <t>
          The reservation of a nickname can fail in several cases. If
          the NICKNAME request contains a malformed value in the
          Use&nbhy;Nickname header field, the MSRP switch MUST answer
          the NICKNAME request with a 424 response code. This can be
          the case when the value of the Use&nbhy;Nickname header
          field does not conform to the syntax.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The reservation of a nickname can also fail if the value of
	  the Use&nbhy;Nickname header field of the NICKNAME request
	  is a reserved word (not to be used as a nickname by any
	  user) or that particular value is already in use by another
	  user. In these cases, the MSRP switch MUST answer the NICKNAME
	  request with a 425 response code.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In both error conditions (receiving a 424 or 425 response
	  code), the nickname usage is considered failed; the nickname
	  is not allocated to this user. The user can select a
	  different nickname and retry another NICKNAME request.
        </t>
	
	<t>
	  If the MSRP switch is able to accept the suggested nickname
	  to be used by this user, the MSRP switch MUST answer the
	  NICKNAME request with a 200 response as per regular MSRP
	  procedures.
	</t>
        <t>
          As indicated earlier, this specification defines a new MSRP
          header field: Use-Nickname. The Use&nbhy;Nickname header
          field carries a nickname string. This specification defines
          the usage of the Use&nbhy;Nickname header field in NICKNAME
          requests. If need arises, usages of the Use&nbhy;Nickname
          header field in other MSRP methods should be specified
          separately.

        <t>
          According to <xref target="RFC4975">RFC 4975</xref>, MSRP
	  uses the <xref target="RFC3629"> UTF-8 transformation

	  Once the MSRP switch has reserved a nickname and has bound

	  MAY allow the usage of the same nickname by the same user
	  (identified by the same URI, such as a SIP AoR) over a
	  second MSRP session. This might be the case if the user
	  joins the same chat room from a different SIP UA. In
	  this case, the user MAY request a nickname that is the same or different
	  than that used in conjunction with the first MSRP
	  session; the MSRP server MAY accept the usage of the same
	  nickname by the same user. The MSRP switch MUST NOT
	  automatically assign the same nickname to more than one MSRP
	  session established from the same URI, because this can
	  create confusion to the user as whether the same nickname is
	  bound to the second MSRP session.

          Typically, a participant will reserve a nickname as soon as the participant

          replace it with a new one at any time during the duration of the

        There are a handful of use cases where a participant would
        like to learn the chat room capabilities supported by the
        local policy of the MSRP switch and the chat room. For
        example, a participant would like to learn if the MSRP switch
        supports private messaging; otherwise, the participant may
        send what he believes is a private IM addressed
        to a participant, but since the MSRP switch does not support
        the functions specified in this memo, the message would
        eventually be distributed to all the participants of the chat
        room.
      </t>

      <t>
        The reverse case also exists. A participant, say Alice, whose
        UA does not support the extensions defined by this
        document joins the chat room. The MSRP switch learns that Alice's
        application does not support private messaging nor nicknames. If
        another participant, say Bob, sends a private message to Alice,
        the MSRP switch does not distribute it to Alice, because Alice is
        not able to differentiate it from a regular message sent to the
        whole roster. Furthermore, if Alice replied to this message, she
        would do it to the whole roster. Because of this, the MSRP switch
        also keeps track of users who do not support the extensions
        defined in this document.
      </t>

      <t>
        In another scenario, the policy of a chat room may indicate
        that certain functions are not allowed. For example, the policy
        may indicate that nicknames or private messages are forbidden.

        In order to provide the user with a good chat room experience,
        we define a new 'chatroom' SDP attribute. The 'chatroom'
        attribute is a <xref target="RFC4566">media-level value
        attribute </xref> that MAY be included in conjunction with an
        MSRP media stream (i.e., when an "m=" line in SDP indicates
        "TCP/MSRP" or "TCP/TLS/MSRP").  The 'chatroom' attribute
        without further modifiers (e.g., chat-tokens) indicates that
        the endpoint supports the procedures described in this
        document for transferring MSRP messages to/from a chat
        room. The 'chatroom' attribute can be complemented with
        additional modifiers that further indicate the intersection of
        support and local policy allowance for a number of functions
        specified in this document. Specifically, we provide the means
        to indicate support for the use of nicknames and private messaging.
      </t>

      <t>
	The 'chatroom' attribute merely indicates the capabilities
	supported and allowed by the local policy. This attribute is
	not a negotiation subject to the <xref target="RFC3264">SDP
	offer/answer model</xref>, but instead a
	declaration. Therefore, a 'chatroom' attribute included in an
	SDP answer does not need to be a subset of the values included
	in the 'chatroom' attribute of its corresponding SDP
	offer. Consequently, an SDP answer MAY contain a 'chatroom'
	attribute even if its corresponding SDP offer did not include
	it.
      </t>

      <t>
	In subsequent <xref target="RFC3264">SDP
	offer/answer</xref> exchanges pertaining to the same session,
	the 'chatroom' attribute MAY be modified with respect to an
	earlier SDP offer/answer exchange. The new value of this
	attribute indicates the current support and local policy,
	meaning that some restrictions can apply now or might have
	been removed. If the 'chatroom' attribute is not included in a
	subsequent SDP offer/answer, but a corresponding MSRP stream
	is still in place, it indicates that support for the
	procedures indicated in this document are disabled.
      </t>

      <t>
        The 'chatroom' SDP attribute has the following <xref
	target="RFC5234"> ABNF </xref> syntax:
      </t>
      <figure>
        <artwork>
          attribute         =/ chatroom-attr
                                    ; attribute defined in RFC 4566
          chatroom-attr     = chatroom-label [":" chat-token 
                              *(SP chat-token)]
          chatroom-label    = "chatroom"
          chat-token        = (nicknames-token / private-msg-token / 
                               ext-token)
          nicknames-token   = "nickname"
          private-msg-token = "private-messages"
          ext-token         = private-token / standard-token
          private-token     = toplabel "." *(domainlabel ".") token
                                    ; toplabel defined in RFC 3261
                                    ; domainlabel defined in RFC 3261
                                    ; token defined in RFC 3261
          standard-token    = token
        </artwork>
      </figure>
      
      <t>
	A given 'chat-token' value MUST NOT appear more than once in a
	'chatroom' attribute.    
      </t>

      <t>
        A conference focus that includes the 'nicknames' token in the
        session description is signaling that the MSRP switch supports and
        the chat room allows the use of the procedures specified in 
        <xref target="nicknames"/>. A conference focus that includes the
        'private-messages' in the SDP description is signaling that the
        MSRP switch supports and the chat room allows the use of the procedures
        specified in <xref target="private-messages" />. 
      </t>

      <t>
        An example of the 'chatroom' attribute for an MSRP media stream
        that indicates the acceptance of nicknames and private
        messages:
      </t>

      <figure><artwork>
          a=chatroom:nickname private-messages
      </artwork></figure>

      <t>
	An example of a 'chatroom' attribute for an MSRP media stream
	where the endpoint, e.g., an MSRP switch, does not allow
	nicknames or private messages.
      </t>

      <figure><artwork>
          a=chatroom
      </artwork></figure>

      <t>
	The 'chatroom' attribute allows extensibility with the
	addition of new tokens. No IANA registry is provided at this
	time, since no extensions are expected at the time of this
	writing. Extensions to the 'chatroom' attribute can be defined
	in IETF documents or as private-vendor extensions. 
      </t>
      <t>
        Extensions defined in an IETF document MUST follow the
        'standard-token' ABNF previously defined. In this type of
        extension, care must be taken in the selection of the token to
        avoid a clash with any of the tokens previously defined.
      </t>
      <t>
	Private extensions MUST follow the 'private-token' ABNF
	previously defined. The 'private-token' MUST be included in the DNS
	name of the vendor. Then, the token is reversed in order to
	avoid clashes of tokens. The following is an example of an
	extension named "foo.chat" by a vendor "example.com"
      </t>
      <figure><artwork>
        a=chatroom:nickname private-messages com.example.chat.foo

	not intended to have the same semantics or even interoperate.

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      
      <t>
	This document proposes extensions to the <xref
	target="RFC4975">Message Session Relay Protocol
	</xref>. Therefore, the security considerations of that
	document apply to this document as well.
      </t>

      <t>
	A chat room is, by its nature, a potential Denial-of-Service
	(DoS) accelerator as it takes a message from one entity and
	sends it to many. Implementers of both UAs and switches need
	to carefully consider the set of anti-DoS measures that are
	appropriate for this application, and switch implementations, in
	particular, ought to include appropriate anti-DoS features. The
	details of what is appropriate will vary over time and will
	also depend on the specific needs of the implementation; thus, they
	cannot be specified here.
      </t>

      <t> 
	If the participant's SIP UA does not understand the
	<xref target="RFC3840"> "isfocus" feature tag </xref>, it will
	not know that it is connected to a conference instance. The participant might not be notified that its MSRP client will try
to send messages having potential multiple recipients to the MSRP switch.  If the participant's MSRP
	client does not support the extensions of this specification,
	it is unlikely that it will try to send a message using the <xref
	target="RFC3862">Message/CPIM wrapper content type</xref>,
	and the MSRP switch will reject the request with a <xref
	target="RFC4975">415 response</xref>.  Still, if a
	participant's MSRP client does create a message with a valid
	<xref target="RFC3862">Message/CPIM wrapper content
	type</xref> having the To header set to the URI of the chat
	room and the From header set to the URI of which the
	participant that is known to the chat room, the participant might
	be unaware that the message can be forwarded to multiple
	recipients. Equally, if the To header is set to a valid URI of
	a recipient known to the chat room, the message can be
	forwarded as a private message without the participant
	knowing.
      </t>

      <t>
	To mitigate these problems, when the chat room detects that a
	UA does not support the procedures of this document
	(i.e., when the SIP UA is not chat room aware), the
	MSRP switch SHOULD send a regular MSRP message indicating that
	the SIP UA is actually part of a chat room and that
	all the messages that the user sends correctly formatted will
	be distributed to a number of participants. Additionally, the
	MSRP switch SHOULD also send a regular MSRP text message
	including the list of participants in the chat room so that
	the user becomes aware of the roster.
      </t>


      <t> 
	If a participant wants to avoid security concerns on the path
	between himself and the MSRP switch (e.g., eavesdropping,
	faked packet injection, or packet corruption), the
	participant's UA can force the usage of MSRP over a
	<xref target="RFC5246">TLS </xref> transport connection. This
	is negotiated in the SDP offer/answer exchange as per the regular procedures of 
	<xref target="RFC4975">RFC 4975 </xref>. This
	negotiation will result in both endpoints establishing a <xref
	target="RFC5246">TLS </xref> transport connection that is used
	to exchange MSRP messages. The MSRP switch may also have local
	policy that forces the usage of TLS transport for all MSRP
	sessions, something that is also negotiated in SDP as per
	the regular procedures of <xref target="RFC4975">RFC 4975 </xref>.
      </t>



      <t> 
        Nicknames are used to show the appearance of the participants
        of the chat room.  A successful takeover of a nickname from a
        participant might lead to private messages being sent to the
        wrong destination.  The recipient's URI will be different from
        the URI associated with the original owner of the nickname, but
        the sender might not notice this.  To avoid takeovers, the MSRP
        switch MUST make sure that a nickname is unique inside a chat
        room. Also, the security consideration for any authenticated
        identity mechanisms used to validate the SIP AOR will apply to
        this document as well. The chat room has a policy that
        determines the time that a nickname is still reserved for its
        holder, once it is no longer being used. This allows, e.g., a
        user that accidentally loses its connectivity, to reconnect
        to the chat room and keep on using the same nickname. It depends
        on the policy of the chat room if a nickname that
        has been previously used by another participant of the chat
        room can be reserved or not.
      </t>

      <t>
	<xref target="using-nicknames"/> discusses the problem of
	similar but different nicknames (e.g., thanks to the use of
	similar characters), and chat rooms MAY provide a mechanism to
	mitigate confusable nicknames.
      </t>
	

      <t>
	Recipients of IMs should be cautious with the
	rendering of content, which can be malicious in nature. This
	includes, but is not limited to, the reception of
	HTML and JavaScript scripts, executable code, phishing
	attempts, etc. Endpoints SHOULD always request permission from
	the user before executing one of these actions. 
      </t>

      <t>
	It must be noted that endpoints using a TLS client side
	certificate with real names in the certificates will not be
	anonymous to the MSRP switch to which they connect. While the name
	in the certificate might not be used by MSRP, the server will
	have a certificate with the actual name in it.
      </t>
