<section title="Introduction">

<t>YANG -- the NETCONF Data Modeling Language <xref target="RFC6020"/>
-- supports modeling of a tree of data elements that represent the
configuration and runtime status of a particular network element
managed via NETCONF. This document defines extensions for the modeling
language YANG as new language statements, which introduce language
abstractions to improve the model extensibility and reuse. The
document reports from modeling experience in the telecommunication
industry and gives model examples from an actual network management
system to highlight the value of proposed language extensions,
especially class inheritance and recursiveness. The language
extensions defined in this document have been implemented with two
open source tools. These tools have been used to validate the model
examples through the document.  If this experimental specification results in
successful usage, it is possible that the 
language extensions defined herein could be updated to incorporate implementation 
and deployment experience, then pursued on the Standards Track, possibly as 
part of a future version of YANG.</t>

<section title="Motivation">

<t>
Following are non-exhaustive motivation examples highlighting usage scenarios for 
language abstractions.
</t>
				<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Many systems today have a Management Information Base (MIB) that in effect is organized as a tree build of recursively nested container nodes. For example, the physical resources in the ENTITY-MIB conceptually form a containment tree. The index entPhysicalContainedIn points to the containing entity in a flat list. The ability to represent nested, recursive data structures of arbitrary depth would enable the representation of the primary containment hierarchy of physical entities as a node tree in the server MIB and in the NETCONF payload.</t>

<t>A manager scanning the network in order to update the state of an inventory management system might be only interested in data structures that represent a specific type of hardware. Such a manager would then look for entities that are of this specific type, including those that are an extension or specialization of this type.  To support this use case, it is helpful to bear the corresponding type information within the data structures, which describe the network element hardware.</t>

<t>A system that is managing network elements is concerned, e.g., with managed objects of type "plug-in modules" that have a name, a version, and an activation state. In this context, it is useful to define the "plug-in module" as a concept that is supposed to be further detailed and extended by additional concrete model elements. In order to realize such a system, it is worthwhile to model abstract entities, which enable reuse and ease concrete refinements of that abstract entity in a second step.</t>

<t>As particular network elements have specific types of components that need to be managed (OS images, plug-in modules, equipment, etc.), it should be possible to define concrete types, which describe the managed object precisely. By using type-safe extensions of basic concepts, a system in the manager role can safely and explicitly determine that e.g., the "equipment" is actually of type "network card".</t>

<t>Currently, different SDOs are working on the harmonization of their
  management information models. Often, a model mapping or
  transformation between systems becomes necessary. The harmonization
  of the models is done e.g., by mapping of the two models on the object
  level or integrating an object hierarchy into an existing
  information model. On the one hand, extending YANG with language abstractions can
  simplify the adoption of IETF resource models by
  other SDOs and facilitate the alignment with other SDOs' resource
  models (e.g., TM Forum SID <xref target="SID_V8"/>).

On the other hand, the proposed YANG extensions can enable the 
utilization of the YANG modeling language in other SDOs, which usually 
model complex management systems in a top-down manner and use 
high-level language features frequently.
</t>

</list>
</t><t>This memo specifies additional modeling features for the YANG
				  language in the area of structured
				  model abstractions, typed
				  references, as well as recursive
				  data structures, and it discusses how these new features can improve the modeling capabilities of YANG.</t>

<t><xref target="sec_ex_phy_network_resource_model"></xref> contains a
  physical resource model that deals with some of the modeling
  challenges illustrated above. <xref target="sec_modeling_entry_mib_entries"></xref> gives an example that uses the
  base classes defined in the physical resource model and derives a
  model for physical entities defined in the Entity MIB.</t>

</section>

<section title="Modeling Improvements with Language Abstractions">



<t>As an enhancement to YANG 1.0, complex types and typed instance
  identifiers provide different technical improvements on the modeling level:</t>

<t>
<list style="symbols">
       
<t> In case the model of a system that should be managed with NETCONF makes use of inheritance, complex types enable an almost one-to-one mapping between the classes in the original model and the YANG module.</t>
       
<t>Typed instance identifiers allow representing associations between
the concepts in a type-safe way to prevent type errors caused by
referring to data nodes of incompatible types. 

This avoids referring to a particular location in the MIB. Referring 
to a particular location in the MIB is not mandated by the domain model.
</t>

<t>Complex types allow defining complete, self-contained type
  definitions. It is not necessary to explicitly add a key statement
  to lists, which use a grouping that defines the data nodes.</t>

<t>Complex types simplify concept refinement by extending a base complex type and make it superfluous to represent concept refinements with workarounds such as huge choice-statements with complex branches.</t> 

<t> Abstract complex types ensure correct usage of abstract concepts
  by enforcing the refinement of a common set of properties before instantiation.</t>

<t>Complex types allow defining recursive structures. This enables representing complex structures of arbitrary depth by nesting instances of basic complex types that may contain themselves.
</t>

<t>Complex types avoid introducing metadata types (e.g., type code enumerations) and metadata leafs (e.g., leafs containing a type code) to indicate which concrete type of object is actually represented by a generic container in the MIB. This also avoids explicitly ruling out illegal use of subtype-specific properties in generic containers.</t>

<t>Complex type instances include the type information in the NETCONF
  payload. This allows determining the actual type of an instance
  during the NETCONF payload parsing and avoids the use in the model of additional leafs, which provide the type information as content.</t> 

<t>Complex types may be declared explicitly as optional features, which is not possible when the actual type of an entity represented by a generic container is indicated with a type code enumeration.</t>

</list>

</t>

<t><xref target="appb3" format="none">Appendix B, "Example YANG Module
    for the IPFIX/PSAMP Model"</xref>, lists technical improvements for
  modeling with complex types and typed instance identifiers and
  exemplifies the usage of the proposed YANG extensions based on the
  IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) / Packet Sampling (PSAMP) configuration model in <xref target="IPFIXCONF"></xref>.</t>

</section>

<section title="Design Approach">
<t>The proposed additional features for YANG in this memo are designed to reuse existing YANG statements whenever possible. Additional semantics is expressed by an extension that is supposed to be used as a substatement of an existing statement.</t>
<t>The proposed features don't change the semantics of models that is valid with respect to the YANG specification <xref target="RFC6020"></xref>.</t>

<t>Since this model is an abstraction of network-element-specific MIB topologies, modeling it with YANG creates some challenges. Some of these challenges and how they can be addressed with complex types are explained below:
</t>

<list style="symbols">     
<t>Modeling of abstract concepts: Classes like "Resource" represent concepts that primarily serve as a base class for derived classes. With complex types, such an abstract concept could be represented by an abstract complex type (see "complex-type extension statement" and "abstract extension statement").
</t>
<t>Class Inheritance: Information models for complex management domains often use class inheritance to create specialized classes like "PhysicalConnector" from a more generic base class (here, "Hardware"), which itself might inherit from another base class ("PhysicalResource"), etc. Complex types allow creating enhanced versions of an existing (abstract or concrete) base type via an extension (see "extends extension statement").
</t>
<t>Recursive containment: In order to specify containment hierarchies, models frequently contain different aggregation associations, in which the target (contained element) is either the containing class itself or a base class of the containing class. In the model above, the recursive containment of "EquipmentHolder" is an example of such a relationship (see the description for the "complex-type EquipmentHolder" in the example model "udmcore" below).</t>

<t>Complex types support such a containment by using a complex type
  (or one of its ancestor types) as the type of an instance or instance list that is part of its definition (see "instance(-list) extension statement").
</t>
<t>Reference relationships: A key requirement on large models for
  network domains with many related managed objects is the ability to
  define inter-class associations that represent essential relationships between
  instances of such a class. 

For example, the relationship between "PhysicalLink" and "Hardware"
tells which physical link is connecting which hardware resources. It
is important to notice that this kind of relationship does not mandate
any particular location of the two connected hardware instances in any
MIB module. Such containment-agnostic relationships can be represented
by a typed instance identifier that embodies one direction of such an
association (see <xref target="sec_typed_instance_identifier"/>,
"Typed Instance Identifier").
</t>
</list>

<t>
The YANG module excerpt below shows how the challenges listed above can be addressed by the Complex Types extension (module import prefix "ct:").
The complete YANG module for the physical resource model in
<xref target="PhysicalRM"/> can be found in <xref target="appb2"
						  format="none">Appendix
  A, "YANG Modules for Physical Network Resource Model and Hardware Entities Model"</xref>.
</t>
<t>
Note: The YANG extensions proposed in this document have been implemented as the open source tools "Pyang Extension for Complex Types" <xref target="Pyang-ct"/>, <xref target="Pyang"/>, and "Libsmi Extension for Complex Types" <xref target="Libsmi"/>. All model examples in the document have been validated with the tools Pyang-ct and Libsmi.

<section anchor="sec_modeling_entry_mib_entries" title="Modeling Entity MIB Entries as Physical Resources">
<t>
The physical resource module described above can now be used to model
physical entities as defined in the Entity MIB <xref target="RFC4133"/>. For each physical entity class listed in the "PhysicalClass" enumeration, a complex type is defined. Each of these complex types extends the most specific complex type already available in the physical resource module. For example, the type "HWModule" extends the complex type "Equipment" as a hardware module. Physical entity properties that should be included in a physical entity complex type are combined in a grouping, which is then used in each complex type definition of an entity.
</t>
<t>
This approach has following benefits:
</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>
The definition of the complex types for hardware entities becomes compact as many of the features can be reused from the basic complex type definition. 
</t>
<t>
Physical entities are modeled in a consistent manner as predefined concepts are extended.
</t>
<t>
Entity-MIB-specific attributes as well as vendor-specific attributes can be added without having to define separate extension data nodes.

<section title="Complex Types">

<section title="Definition">
<t>YANG type concept is currently restricted to simple types, e.g., restrictions of primitive types, enumerations, or union of simple types.</t>
<t>Complex types are types with a rich internal structure, which may be composed of substatements defined in Table 1 (e.g., lists, leafs, containers, choices). A new complex type may extend an existing complex type. This allows providing type-safe extensions to existing YANG models as instances of the new type.</t>
<t>Complex types have the following characteristics:</t>
<t>
	<list style="symbols">
		<t>Introduction of new types, as a named, formal description of a concrete manageable resource as well as abstract concepts.</t>
		<t>Types can be extended, i.e., new types can be
		defined by specializing existing types and adding new
		features. 

Instances of such an extended type can be used wherever instances of the base type may appear.</t>
		<t>The type information is made part of the NETCONF payload in case a derived type substitutes a base type. This enables easy and efficient consumption of payload elements representing complex type instances.</t>
	</list>
	</t>
</section>

<section title="complex-type Extension Statement">
	<t>The extension statement "complex-type" is introduced; it
	accepts an arbitrary number of statements that define node
	trees, among other common YANG statements ("YANG Statements",
	Section 7 of <xref target="RFC6020"></xref>).</t>

<t>Complex type definitions may appear at every place where a grouping may be defined. That includes the module, submodule, rpc, input, output, notification, container, and list statements.
</t>	
<t>Complex type names populate a distinct namespace. As with YANG
  groupings, it is possible to define a complex type and a data node
  (e.g., leaf, list, instance statements) with the same name in the
  same scope. All complex type names defined within a parent node or
  at the top level of the module or its submodules share the same type identifier namespace. This namespace is scoped to the parent node or module.</t>
	<t>A complex type MAY have an instance key. An instance key is either defined with the "key" statement as part of the complex type or is inherited from the base complex type. It is not allowed to define an additional key if the base complex type or one of its ancestors already defines a key.</t>
	<t>Complex type definitions do not create nodes in the schema tree.</t>
</section>

<section title="instance Extension Statement">
	<t>The "instance" extension statement is used to instantiate a complex type by creating a subtree in the management information node tree. The instance statement takes one argument that is the identifier of the complex type instance. It is followed by a block of substatements. </t>
	<t>The type of the instance is specified with the mandatory
	"ct:instance-type" substatement. The type of an instance MUST
	be a complex type. Common YANG statements may be used as
	substatements of the "instance" statement. An instance is
	optional by default. To make an instance mandatory, "mandatory
	true" has to be applied as a substatement.

	<t>The "instance" and "instance-list" extension statements
	(see <xref target="sec_instance-list"/>, "instance-list Extension Statement") are similar to the existing "leaf" and "leaf-list" statements, with the exception that the content is composed of subordinate elements according to the instantiated complex type.</t>
<t>It is also possible to add additional data nodes by using the
  corresponding leaf, leaf-list, list, and choice-statements, etc., as
  substatements of the instance declaration. This is an in-place
  augmentation of the used complex type confined to a complex type
  instantiation (see also <xref target="sec_using_complex_types"/>, "Using Complex Types", for details on augmenting complex types).</t>
</section>

<section title="instance-list Extension Statement" anchor="sec_instance-list">
	<t>The "instance-list" extension statement is used to instantiate a complex type by defining a sequence of subtrees in the management information node tree. In addition, the "instance-list" statement takes one argument that is the identifier of the complex type instances. It is followed by a block of substatements. </t>
	<t>The type of the instance is specified with the mandatory "ct:instance-type" substatement. In addition, it can be defined how often an instance may appear in the schema tree by using the "min-elements" and "max-elements" substatements. Common YANG statements may be used as substatements of the "instance-list" statement.</t>

<t>In analogy to the "instance" statement, YANG substatements like "list",
"choice", "leaf", etc., MAY be used to augment the "instance-list"
elements at the root level with additional data nodes.</t>

</section>

<section title="extends Extension Statement">
	<t>A complex type MAY extend exactly one existing base complex
	type by using the "extends" extension statement. The keyword
	"extends" MAY occur as a substatement of the "complex-type" extension statement. The argument of the "complex-type" extension statement refers to the base complex type via its name. In case a complex type represents configuration data (the default), it MUST have a key; otherwise, it MAY have a key. A key is either defined with the "key" statement as part of the complex type or is inherited from the base complex type.</t>

	</texttable>
</section>

<section title="abstract Extension Statement">
	<t>Complex types may be declared to be abstract by using the
	"abstract" extension statement. An abstract complex type
	cannot be instantiated, meaning it cannot appear as the most
	specific type of an instance in the NETCONF payload. In case an abstract type extends a base type, the base complex type MUST be also abstract. By default, complex types are not abstract.</t>
	<t>The abstract complex type serves only as a base type for
	derived concrete complex types and cannot be used as a type
	for an instance in the NETCONF payload. </t>
	<t>The "abstract" extension statement takes a single string
	argument, which is either "true" or "false". In case a
	"complex-type" statement does not contain an "abstract"
	statement as a substatement, the default is "false". The "abstract" statement does not support any substatements.</t>
</section>

<section title="XML Encoding Rules">

<t>An "instance" node is encoded as an XML element, where an
  "instance-list" node is encoded as a series of XML elements. The
  corresponding XML element names are the "instance" and
  "instance-list" identifiers, respectively, and they use the same XML
  namespace as the module.</t>

<t>Instance child nodes are encoded as subelements of the instance XML element. Subelements representing child nodes defined in the same complex type may appear in any order. However, child nodes of an extending complex type follow the child nodes of the extended complex type. As such, the XML encoding of lists is similar to the encoding of containers and lists in YANG.</t>

<t>Instance key nodes are encoded as subelements of the instance XML
  element. Instance key nodes must appear in the same order as they
  are defined within the "key" statement of the corresponding complex type
  definition and precede all other nodes defined in the same complex
  type. That is, if key nodes are defined in an extending complex type, XML elements representing key data precede all other XML elements representing child nodes. On the other hand, XML elements representing key data follow the XML elements representing data nodes of the base type. </t>
<t>The type of the actual complex type instance is encoded in a type
  element, which is put in front of all instance child elements,
  including key nodes, as described in <xref target="sec_type_encoding_rules"/> ("Type Encoding Rules").</t>

<t>The proposed XML encoding rules conform to the YANG XML encoding
  rules in <xref target="RFC6020"/>. 
Compared to YANG, enabling key definitions in derived hierarchies is a
  new feature introduced with the complex types extension. As a new
  language feature, complex types also introduce a new payload entry for the instance type identifier.</t>

<t>Based on our implementation experience, the proposed XML encoding
  rules support consistent mapping of YANG models with complex types
  to an XML schema using XML complex types.</t>
</section>

<section title="Type Encoding Rules" anchor="sec_type_encoding_rules">
	<t>In order to encode the type of an instance in the NETCONF payload, XML elements named "type" belonging to the XML namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-complex-type-instance" are added to the serialized form of instance and instance-list nodes in the payload. The suggested namespace prefix is "cti". The "cti:type" XML elements are inserted before the serialized form of all members that have been declared in the corresponding complex type definition. The "cti:type" element is inserted for each type in the extension chain to the actual type of the instance (most specific last). Each type name includes its corresponding namespace.</t>
	<t>The type of a complex type instance MUST be encoded in the
	reply to NETCONF <![CDATA[<get>]]> and
	<![CDATA[<get-config>]]> operations, and in the payload of a
	NETCONF <![CDATA[<edit-config>]]> operation if the operation
	is "create" or "replace". The type of the instance MUST also
	be specified in case <![CDATA[<copy-config>]]> is used to
	export a configuration to a resource addressed with an
	URI. The type of the instance has to be specified in
	user-defined remote procedure calls (RPCs).</t>
	<t>The type of the instance MAY be specified in case the operation is "merge" (either because this is explicitly specified or no operation attribute is provided).</t>

	<t>In case the node already exists in the target configuration and the type attribute (type of a complex type instance) is specified but differs from the data in the target, an <![CDATA[<rpc-error>]]> element is returned with an <![CDATA[<error-app-tag>]]> value of "wrong-complex-type". In case no such element is present in the target configuration but the type attribute is missing in the configuration data, an <![CDATA[<rpc-error>]]> element is returned with an <![CDATA[<error-tag>]]> value of "missing-attribute".</t>
	<t>The type MUST NOT be specified in case the operation is "delete".</t>
</section>

<section title="Extension and Feature Definition Module">
	<t>The module below contains all YANG extension definitions for complex types and typed instance identifiers.
In addition, a "complex-type" feature is defined, which may be used to
	  provide conditional or alternative modeling, depending on
	  the support status of complex types in a NETCONF server. A
	  NETCONF server that supports the modeling features for complex types and the XML encoding for complex types as defined in this document MUST advertise this as a feature. This is done by including the feature name "complex-types" in the feature parameter list as part of the NETCONF <![CDATA[<hello>]]> message as described in Section 5.6.4 in <xref target="RFC6020"></xref>.

<section title="Update Rules for Modules Using Complex Types">

<t>In addition to the module update rules specified in Section 10
  in <xref target="RFC6020"></xref>, modules that
  define complex types, instances of complex types, and typed instance identifiers must obey following rules:
<list style="symbols">
<t>New complex types MAY be added.</t>
<t>A new complex type MAY extend an existing complex type. </t>
<t>New data definition statements MAY be added to a complex type only if:
   <list style="symbols">
         <t>they are not mandatory or</t>
         <t>they are not conditionally dependent on a new feature
         (i.e., they do not have an "if-feature" statement that refers to a new feature). </t>
   </list>
</t>
<t>The type referred to by the instance-type statement may be changed to a type that derives from the original type only if the original type does not represent configuration data.</t>
</list>
</t>

</section>

<section title="Using Complex Types" anchor="sec_using_complex_types">

<t>All data nodes defined inside a complex type reside in the complex type namespace, which is their parent node namespace.</t> 

<section title="Overriding Complex Type Data Nodes">
<t>It is not allowed to override a data node inherited from a base
  type. That is, it is an error if a type "base" with a leaf named "foo" is extended by another complex type ("derived") with a leaf named "foo" in the same module. In case they are derived in different modules, there are two distinct "foo" nodes that are mapped to the XML namespaces of the module, where the complex types are specified.</t>
<t>A complex type that extends a basic complex type may use the "refine" statement in order to improve an inherited data node. The target node identifier must be qualified by the module prefix to indicate clearly which inherited node is refined. 
</t>


<t>The following refinements can be done:
<list style="symbols">
	<t>A leaf or choice node may have a default value, or a new default
          value if it already had one.
	</t>
	<t>Any node may have a different "description" or "reference" string.
	</t>
	<t>A leaf, anyxml, or choice node may have a "mandatory true"
          statement. However, it is not allowed to change from "mandatory true" to
          "mandatory false".
	</t>
	<t>A leaf, leaf-list, list, container, or anyxml node may have
           additional "must" expressions.
 	</t>
	<t>A list, leaf-list, instance, or instance-list node may have a 
    "min-elements" statement, if the base type does not have one or
    does not have one with a value that is greater than the minimum value of the base type.
	</t>
	<t>A list, leaf-list, instance, or instance-list node may have a 
    "max-elements" statement, if the base type does not have one or
    does not have one with a value that is smaller than the maximum value of the base type.
	</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>It is not allowed to refine complex-type nodes inside "instance" or "instance-list" statements.</t>
</section>


<section title="Augmenting Complex Types">

<t>Augmenting complex types is only allowed if a complex type is
  instantiated in an "instance" or "instance-list" statement. This
  confines the effect of the augmentation to the location in the
  schema tree where the augmentation is done. The argument of the
  "augment" statement MUST be in the descendant form (as defined by
  the rule "descendant-schema-nodeid" in Section 12 in <xref target="RFC6020"/>). </t>

<artwork align="left"><![CDATA[
   ct:complex-type Chassis {
           ct:extends EquipmentHolder;
           container chassisInfo {
                  config false;
                  leaf numberOfSlots { type uint16; }
                  leaf occupiedSlots { type uint16; }
                  leaf height {type unit16;}
                  leaf width {type unit16;}
	     }
   }

   ct:instance-list chassis {
           type Chassis;
           augment "chassisInfo" {
                  leaf modelId { type string; }
           }
   } 

]]></artwork>

<t>When augmenting a complex type,  only the "container", "leaf", "list", "leaf-list",  "choice", "instance", "instance-list", and "if-feature" statements may be used within the "augment" statement. The nodes added by the augmentation MUST NOT be mandatory nodes. One or many "augment" statements may not cause the creation of multiple nodes with the same name from the same namespace in the target node.</t>

<t>To achieve less-complex modeling, this document proposes the augmentation of complex type instances without recursion.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Controlling the Use of Complex Types">
<t>A server might not want to support all complex types defined in a supported module. This issue can be addressed with YANG features as follows:
       <list style="symbols">
       <t>Features are defined that are used inside complex type
       definitions (by using "if-feature" as a substatement) to make
       them optional. In this case, such complex types may only be
       instantiated if the feature is supported (advertised as a capability in the NETCONF <![CDATA[<hello>]]> message).
       </t>
<t>The "deviation" statement may be applied to node trees, which are created by "instance" and "instance-list" statements. In this case, only the substatement "deviate not-supported" is allowed.
</t>
<t>It is not allowed to apply the "deviation" statement to node tree elements that may occur because of the recursive use of a complex type. 
Other forms of deviations ("deviate add", "deviate replace", "deviate delete") are NOT supported inside node trees spanned by "instance" or "instance-list".
	</t>
     </list>
As complex type definitions do not contribute by themselves to the
       data node tree, data node declarations inside complex types
       cannot be the target of deviations. 
</t>

<t>
In the example below, client applications are informed that the leaf
"occupiedSlots" is not supported in the top-level chassis. However, if
a chassis contains another chassis, the contained chassis may support
the leaf that reports the number of occupied slots. 
</t>

<artwork align="left"><![CDATA[

  deviation "/chassis/chassisSpec/occupiedSlots" {
     deviate not-supported;
  }

]]></artwork>

</section>

<section title="Typed Instance Identifier" anchor="sec_typed_instance_identifier">

<section title="Definition">
<t>Typed instance identifier relationships are an addition to the relationship types already defined in YANG, where the leafref relationship is location dependent, and the instance-identifier does not specify to which type of instances the identifier points.</t>
<t>A typed instance identifier represents a reference to an instance of a complex type without being restricted to a particular location in the containment tree. This is done by using the extension statement "instance-type" as a substatement of the existing "type instance identifier" statement.
</t>
<t>Typed instance identifiers allow referring to instances of complex types that may be located anywhere in the schema tree. The "type" statement plays the role of a restriction that must be fulfilled by the target node, which is referred to with the instance identifier. The target node MUST be of a particular complex type, either the type itself or any type that extends this complex type.</t>
	</section>

<section title="instance-type Extension Statement">
<t>The "instance-type" extension statement specifies the complex type
  of the instance to which the instance-identifier refers. The referred instance may also instantiate any complex type that extends the specified complex type.</t>

<t>The instance complex type is identified by the single name argument. The referred complex type MUST have a key. This extension statement MUST be used as a substatement of the "type instance-identifier" statement. The "instance-type" extension statement does not support any substatements.</t>

</section>

	
<section title="Typed Instance Identifier Example">
	<t>In the example below, a physical link connects an arbitrary number of physical ports. Here, typed instance identifiers are used to denote which "PhysicalPort" instances (anywhere in the data tree) are connected by a "PhysicalLink". </t>

<artwork align="left"><![CDATA[

<section title="Modeling Improvements for the IPFIX/PSAMP Model with Complex Types and Typed Instance Identifiers">

<t>The module below is a variation of the IPFIX/PSAMP configuration model, which uses complex types and typed instance identifiers to model the concept outlined in <xref target="IPFIXCONF"/>.</t>
<t>When looking at the YANG module with complex types and typed
  instance identifiers, various technical improvements on the modeling level become apparent.</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">

<t>There is almost a one-to-one mapping between the domain concepts introduced in IPFIX and the complex types in the YANG module.</t>

<t>All associations between the concepts (besides containment) are
  represented with typed identifiers. That avoids having to refer to a
  particular location in the tree. Referring to a particular in the tree is not mandated by the original model.</t>

<t>It is superfluous to represent concept refinement (class
  inheritance in the original model) with containment in the form of quite big choice-statements with complex branches. Instead, concept refinement is realized by complex types extending a base complex type.</t>

<t>It is unnecessary to introduce metadata identities and leafs (e.g., "identity cacheMode" and "leaf cacheMode" in "grouping cacheParameters") that just serve the purpose of indicating which concrete subtype of a generic type (modeled as grouping, which contains the union of all features of all subtypes) is actually represented in the MIB.</t>

<t>Ruling out illegal use of subtype-specific properties (e.g., "leaf maxFlows") by using "when" statements that refer to a subtype discriminator is not necessary (e.g., when "../cacheMode != 'immediate'").</t>

<t>Defining properties like the configuration status
  wherever a so called "parameter grouping" is used is not necessary. Instead, those
  definitions can be put inside the complex type definition itself.</t>

<t>Separating the declaration of the key from the related data nodes
  definitions in a grouping (see use of "grouping
  selectorParameters") can be avoided.</t>

<t>Complex types may be declared as optional features. If the type is indicated with an identity (e.g., "identity  immediate"), this is not possible, since "if-feature" is not allowed as a substatement of "identity".</t>
