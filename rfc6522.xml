	<abstract>
		<t> The multipart/report Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
		    (MIME) media type is a general "family" or "container" type
		    for electronic mail reports of any kind.  Although this
		    memo defines only the use of the multipart/report media
		    type with respect to delivery status reports, mail
		    processing programs will benefit if a single media type is
		    used for all kinds of reports. </t>

		<t> This memo obsoletes "The Multipart/Report Content Type
                         for the Reporting of
                  Mail System Administrative Messages", RFC 3462, and marks RFC 3462 and its predecessor as "Historic".</t>

	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> <xref target="OLD-REPORT"/> and its antecedent declared
		    the multipart/report media type for use within the
		    <xref target="MIME"/> construct to create a container
		    for mail system administrative reports of various
		    kinds. </t>

		<t> Practical experience has shown that the general
		    requirement of having that media type constrained to be
		    used only as the outermost MIME type of a message is
		    overly restrictive and limits such things as the
		    transmission of multiple administrative reports within a
		    single overall message container.  In particular, it
		    prevents one from forwarding a report as part of another
		    multipart MIME message. </t>

		<t> This memo removes that constraint.  No other changes apart
		    from some editorial ones are made.  Other memos might
		    update other documents to establish or clarify the
		    constraints on use of multipart/report in contexts where
		    such are needed. </t>

		<t> This memo obsoletes RFC 3462.  RFC 3462 and its predecessor, RFC 1892, have been marked as "Historic".</t>

		<t> The syntax of multipart/report is identical to the
		    multipart/mixed content type defined in
		    <xref target="MIME"/>.  The report-type parameter
		    identifies the type of report.  The parameter is the
		    MIME subtype of the second body part of the
		    multipart/report.  (See <xref target="new_reports"/>.) </t>

		<t> The multipart/report media type contains either two or
		    three sub-parts, in the following order:

		    <list style="numbers">
			<t> (REQUIRED) The first body part contains a human-readable message.  The purpose of this message
			    is to provide an easily understood description of
			    the condition(s) that caused the report to be
			    generated, for a human reader who might not have a
			    user agent capable of interpreting the second
			    section of the multipart/report.  The text in the
			    first section can use any IANA-registered MIME
			    media type, charset, or language.  Where a
			    description of the error is desired in several
			    languages or several media, a multipart/alternative
			    construct MAY be used.  This body part MAY also be
			    used to send detailed information that cannot be
			    easily formatted into the second body
			    part. </t>

			<t> (REQUIRED) A machine-parsable body part containing
			    an account of the reported message handling event.
			    The purpose of this body part is to provide a
			    machine-readable description of the condition(s)
			    that caused the report to be generated, along with
			    details not present in the first body part that
			    might be useful to human experts.  An initial body
			    part, message/delivery-status, is defined in
			    <xref target="DSN-FORMAT"/>. </t>

			<t> (OPTIONAL) A body part containing the returned
			    message or a portion thereof.  This information
			    could be useful to aid human experts in diagnosing
			    problems.  (Although it might also be useful to
			    allow the sender to identify the message about
			    which the report was issued, it is hoped that the
			    envelope-id and original-recipient-address
			    returned in the message/report body part will
			    replace the traditional use of the returned
			    content for this purpose.) </t>
		    </list> </t>

		<t> Return of content can be wasteful of network bandwidth
		    and a variety of implementation strategies can be used.
		    Generally, the sender needs to choose the appropriate
		    strategy and inform the recipient of the required level
		    of returned content required.  In the absence of an
		    explicit request for level of return of content such as
		    that provided in <xref target="DSN-SMTP"/>, the agent that
		    generated the delivery service report SHOULD return the
		    full message content. </t>

		<t> When 8-bit or binary data not encoded in a 7-bit form is
		    to be returned, and the return path is not guaranteed to
		    be 8-bit or binary capable, two options are available.
		    The original message MAY be re-encoded into a legal
		    7-bit MIME message or the text/rfc822-headers media type
		    MAY be used to return only the original message
		    headers. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="type2" title="The text/rfc822-headers Media Type">
		<t> The text/rfc822-headers media type provides a mechanism
		    to label and return only the <xref target="MAIL"/>
		    header of a failed message.  The header is not the
		    complete message and SHOULD NOT be returned using the
		    message/rfc822 media type defined in
		    <xref target="MIME-TYPES"/>.  The returned header is
		    useful for identifying the failed message and for
		    diagnostics based on the Received header fields. </t>

		<t> The text/rfc822-headers media type is defined as follows:

		    <list style="hanging">
			<t hangText="Type name:"> text </t>
			<t hangText="Subtype name:"> rfc822-headers </t>
			<t hangText="Required parameters:"> None </t>
			<t hangText="Optional parameters:"> None </t>
			<t hangText="Encoding considerations:">
				7-bit is sufficient for normal mail headers,
				however, if the headers are broken or
				extended and require encoding to make them
				legal 7-bit content, they MAY be encoded with
				quoted-printable as defined in
				<xref target="MIME"/>. </t>
			<t hangText="Security considerations:">
				See <xref target="sc"/> of [RFC6522]. </t>
			<t hangText="Interoperability considerations:">

		    </list> </t>

		<t> The text/rfc822-headers body part SHOULD contain all the
		    mail header fields from the message that caused the
		    report.  The header includes all header fields prior to
		    the first blank line in the message.  They include the
		    MIME-Version and MIME content description fields. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="new_reports" title="Registering New Report Types">
		<t> Registration of new media types for the purpose of
		    creating a new report format SHOULD note in the Intended
		    Usage section of the media type registration that the type
		    being registered is suitable for use as a report-type
		    (i.e., the second body part) in the context of this
		    specification. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
		<t> IANA has updated the Media Type Registry
		    to indicate that this memo contains the current definition
		    of the multipart/report and text/rfc822-headers media
		    types, obsoleting <xref target="OLD-REPORT"/>. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="sc" title="Security Considerations">
		<t> Automated use of report types without authentication
		    presents several security issues.  Forging negative
		    reports presents the opportunity for denial-of-service
		    attacks when the reports are used for automated
		    maintenance of directories or mailing lists.  Forging
		    positive reports can cause the sender to incorrectly
		    believe a message was delivered when it was not. </t>

		<t> A signature covering the entire multipart/report structure
		    could be used to prevent such forgeries; such a signature
		    scheme is, however, beyond the scope of this document. </t>

<t>This memo defines a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) content-type that may be used by a message transfer agent (MTA) or electronic mail gateway to report the result of an attempt to deliver a message to one or more recipients.  This content-type is intended as a machine-processable replacement for the various types of delivery status notifications currently used in Internet electronic mail.  Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other messaging systems (such as X.400 or the so-called "Local Area Network (LAN)-based" systems), the Delivery Status Notification (DSN) protocol is designed to be useful in a multi-protocol messaging environment.  To this end, the protocol described in this memo provides for the carriage of "foreign" addresses and error codes, in addition to those normally used in Internet mail.  Additional attributes may also be defined to support "tunneling" of foreign notifications through Internet mail. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<organization /></author>
<date year='2003' month='January' />
<abstract>
<t>The Multipart/Report Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) content-type is a general "family" or "container" type for electronic mail reports of any kind.  Although this memo defines only the use of the Multipart/Report content-type with respect to delivery status reports, mail processing programs will benefit if a single content-type is used to for all kinds of reports.  This document is part of a four document set describing the delivery status report service.  This collection includes the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) extensions to request delivery status reports, a MIME content for the reporting of delivery reports, an enumeration of extended status codes, and a multipart container for the delivery report, the original message, and a human-friendly summary of the failure.
