        	<section title="Background on 'IAOC Liaisons' to Nominating Committees">

			     <t>When RFC 7437 <xref target="RFC7437"/> was approved, it explicitly 
			         charged the nominating committee with selecting and reviewing certain members of 
			         the IAOC. However, <xref target="RFC7437"/> did not provide for the IAOC to 
			         send a liaison to the nominating committee.
		   	      </t>

		    	  <t>This was not thought to be an obstacle because  
			        <xref target="RFC7437"/> allowed any committee member to propose a liaison 
                    from the IAOC:
		    	  </t>

		   	      <t><list style="empty">
			         <t>Any committee member may propose the addition of a liaison from other
   				         unrepresented organizations to participate in some or all of the
   				         deliberations of the committee.  The addition must be approved by the
   				         committee according to its established voting mechanism.  Liaisons
   				         participate as representatives of their respective organizations.
			    	</t>
		          </list></t>

            	<t>Beginning in 2010, the IAOC provided a liaison to each nominating
                		committee.  In 2016, the IAOC did not provide a liaison because the
	                	nominating committee was not appointing an IAOC member.  The previous 
        	        	nominating committee
                		had filled a mid-term vacancy (using the process described in Section 3.5. of
                		<xref target="RFC7437"/>) by appointing an IAOC member for a term longer than 
                        two years.
                		In 2017, the NomCom was selecting an IAOC member, but the opportunity to
                		request a liaison from the IAOC was overlooked, because this practice 
               		 	wasn't part of the 
                		documented process in <xref target="RFC7437"/>.
            	</t>

    			<t>This specification adds the previously ad hoc role
			to <xref target="RFC7437"/> so that  
                		future nominating committees will be less likely to overlook it.
			    </t>
		    
			    <t>Although past ad hoc practice has characterized this role as a "liaison", 
                    this specification labels the role as 
				    an "advisor".
				    The rationale for this change in nomenclature is provided in 
                <xref target="why_advisor"/>.

	                	<t>The editor of this document briefly considered proposing a new and 
                            IAOC-specific 
	                    	role to <xref target="RFC7437"/> 
	                    	but considered such a proposal to be complex. Anticipating every 
	                    	corner case in IETF process BCPs is
				challenging and prone to error, and as this 
	                    	specification was being written,
	                    	the IETF Chair was sponsoring a design team reviewing all aspects of the 
	                    	IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA).
				Therefore, the structure and membership
					        of the IAOC itself could
	                    	change in the near future. Instead, the
	                    	specification describes how the nominating committee requests 
                            advisors and builds

	                   <t>Discussions on the IETF NomCom mailing list led to the 
                            recognition that "liaison" was not the best 
	                    	description of this role. 
	                   </t>
	    
<t>The role of liaison defined in Section 4.7 of <xref target="RFC7437"/>
places some significant obligations on liaisons beyond what is necessary for
someone to answer questions from the nominating committee about the
IAOC. These obligations include the following:</t>
	            
				       <t><list style="symbols">
					       <t>Liaisons are responsible for ensuring the nominating committee in
						      general and the Chair in particular execute their assigned duties in
						      the best interest of the IETF community.
					       </t>
	                
					       <t>Liaisons from the IESG, IAB, and Internet Society Board of Trustees
						      (if one is appointed) are expected to review the operation and
	                          execution process of the nominating committee and to report any
	                          concerns or issues to the Chair of the nominating committee
	                          immediately.  If they cannot resolve the issue between themselves,
	                       	  liaisons must report it according to the dispute resolution process
	                          stated elsewhere in this document.
	                       </t>
	                
	                       <t>Liaisons may have other nominating committee responsibilities as
	                   		  required by their respective organizations or requested by the
	                          nominating committee; such responsibilities may not
	                		  conflict with any other provisions of this document.
	                       </t>
	                	</list></t>
	            
				<t>Finally, as mentioned in Section 4.6 of <xref
				target="RFC7437"/>,	
				all of the liaisons are included in the pool of people who 
					are eligible to be selected as 
					a replacement for a Chair. 
				</t>
	            
				<t><list style="empty">
					<t>There are a variety of ordinary circumstances that may arise from
						time to time that could result in a Chair being unavailable to
						oversee the activities of the committee.  The Chair, in consultation
						with the Internet Society President, may appoint a substitute from a
						pool comprised of the liaisons currently serving on the committee and
						the prior year's Chair or designee.
					</t>
				</list></t>

				<t>Note: During discussion of this
				specification, we noted that any liaison would
				be part of the pool of potential substitute
				nominating committee Chairs.
It wasn't clear to the discussion participants whether there was an
intentional decision to make liaisons voted onto the nominating committee
eligible to be substitute Chairs.
That potential change
				is out of scope for this specification but may
				be a conversation worth having separately.
	                </t>
		                
				<t>All of these obligations are important, 
                    but there are always at least two full liaisons
					from the confirming bodies that are already responsible for those responsibilities. 

					It is simply not necessary to make
					the job of helping the nominating
					committee understand the role and
					operational practices of the IAOC more
					demanding than it must be.
				</t>
	            
				<t>So, requiring the IAOC to name a formal liaison to the nominating committee isn't
					justified.
				</t>
	
			</section>
	
			<section title="Why Is This Role Not Required to Be a Sitting IAOC Member?">

				<t>In addition to the reasons given in <xref target="not_liaison"/>, the
					requirement that the IAB and IESG liaisons to the nominating committee
					be sitting members of the organizations they represent, whose positions are
					not being reviewed by this nominating committee, is especially challenging
					for the IAOC.
				</t>
	
	    		<t>Many IAOC positions are filled by members who are
			already members of IETF leadership and are subject to
			review by the nominating committee. This means that
			limiting an IAOC liaison to one of the sitting members
			would mean that in some years the only individuals
			eligible to serve as liaison for the nominating
			committee would be sitting members of the IAOC that a)
			were appointed by the previous nominating committee
			and are not being by the current nominating committee,
			or b) were appointed by the IAB or IESG and are not
			being reviewed by the current IAB or IESG. "Eligible"
			does not also mean "willing and able to serve", so it
			is possible that an IAOC might find itself with no
			sitting member to send as advisor in some years.
				</t>
	    
				<t>Although all IAOC liaisons to the nominating committee have served as sitting members 
					of the IAOC, given 10 years of
					IAOC operation, this specification assumes that other members of the community 
					have sufficent
					experience to provide guidance if the IAOC chooses to suggest such a person. 
					If any given IAOC thought that was important, they could certainly continue to 
					suggest sitting 
					members, but if no sitting member was willing and able to serve,
	                the IAOC would be free to do the next best thing 
					and would likely be the best qualified group to decide who to send.
				</t> 
			
			</section>     

			<section title="Why Does the Nominating Committee Request an IAOC Advisor?">

				<t>This specification could have described the mechanism in one of two ways:
				</t>

				<t><list style="symbols">
					<t>the IAOC could simply provide the name of the advisor to the nominating 
						committee, or 
					</t>

					<t>the nominating committee could request the name of an advisor from the IAOC.
					</t>
				</list></t>

				<t>Either choice could work. The reason that this specification chose to have the 
					nominating committee make the first move is that this is more 
					similar to the way other 
					advisors to the nominating committee are selected, 
					except that the nominating committee is asking the IAOC
					for a suggestion before inviting the advisor to join the nominating committee.
				</t>

				<t>The suggestion is, in fact, a suggestion; the nominating committee still votes
					to invite this advisor as they would vote to invite any advisor, as described in
					Section 4.3 of <xref target="RFC7437"/>.
				</t>
