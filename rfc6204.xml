    <keyword>IPv6 CE requirements</keyword>

    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies requirements for an IPv6 Customer
      Edge (CE) router. Specifically, the current version of this
      document focuses on the basic provisioning of an IPv6 CE router
      and the provisioning of IPv6 hosts attached to it.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document defines basic IPv6 features for a residential
      or small-office router, referred to as an IPv6 CE
      router. Typically, these routers also support IPv4.</t>

      <t>Mixed environments of dual-stack hosts and IPv6-only hosts
      (behind the CE router) can be more complex if the IPv6-only
      devices are using a translator to access IPv4 servers <xref
      target="RFC6144"></xref>.  Support for
      such mixed environments is not in scope of this document.</t>

      <t>This document specifies how an IPv6 CE router automatically
      provisions its WAN interface, acquires address space for
      provisioning of its LAN interfaces, and fetches other
      configuration information from the service provider
      network. Automatic provisioning of more complex topology than a
      single router with multiple LAN interfaces is out of scope for
      this document.</t>

      <t>See <xref target="RFC4779"></xref> for a discussion of options
      available for deploying IPv6 in service provider access networks.</t>

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

          (or higher-layer) "tunnels", such as tunnels over IPv4 or IPv6
          itself.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Architecture">

      <section title="Current IPv4 End-User Network Architecture">

        <t>An end-user network will likely support both IPv4 and
        IPv6. It is not expected that an end-user will change their
        existing network topology with the introduction of IPv6. There
        are some differences in how IPv6 works and is provisioned;
        these differences have implications for the network architecture. A typical
        IPv4 end-user network consists of a "plug and play" router with
        NAT functionality and a single link behind it, connected to
        the service provider network.</t>

        <t>A typical IPv4 NAT deployment by default blocks all
        incoming connections. Opening of ports is typically allowed
        using a Universal Plug and Play Internet Gateway Device
        (UPnP IGD) <xref target="UPnP-IGD"></xref> or some other
        firewall control protocol.</t>

        <t>Another consequence of using private address space in the
        end-user network is that it provides stable addressing;
        i.e., it never changes even when you change service providers,
        and the addresses are always there even when the WAN interface
        is down or the customer edge router has not yet been
        provisioned.</t>

        <t>Rewriting addresses on the edge of the network also allows for some
        rudimentary multihoming, even though using NATs for multihoming does
        not preserve connections during
        a fail-over event <xref target="RFC4864"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Many existing routers support dynamic routing, and advanced
        end-users can build arbitrary, complex networks using manual configuration
        of address prefixes combined with a dynamic routing protocol.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="IPv6 End-User Network Architecture">

        <t>The end-user network architecture for IPv6 should provide
        equivalent or better capabilities and functionality than the
        current IPv4 architecture.</t>

        <t>The end-user network is a stub network. Figure 1 illustrates the
        model topology for the end-user network.</t>

          <t>Provisioning of the LAN interfaces</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>For IPv6 multicast traffic, the IPv6 CE router may act as a
      Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) proxy <xref
      target="RFC4605"></xref> and may support a dynamic multicast
      routing protocol.</t>

      <t>The IPv6 CE router may be manually configured in an arbitrary
      topology with a dynamic routing protocol. Automatic provisioning
      and configuration are described for a single IPv6 CE router
      only.</t>

      <section title="Local Communication">

        <t>Link-local IPv6 addresses are used by hosts communicating
        on a single link. Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses (ULAs)
        <xref target="RFC4193"></xref> are used by hosts communicating
        within the end-user network across multiple links, but without
        requiring the application to use a globally routable
        address. The IPv6 CE router defaults to acting as the
        demarcation point between two networks by providing a ULA
        boundary, a multicast zone boundary, and ingress and egress
        traffic filters.</t>

        <t> A dual-stack host is multihomed to IPv4 and IPv6
        networks. The IPv4 and IPv6 topologies may not be congruent,
        and different addresses may have different reachability,
        e.g., ULAs. A host stack has to be able to quickly
        fail over and try a different source address and destination
        address pair if communication fails, as outlined in <xref
        target="HAPPY-EYEBALLS"></xref>.</t>

        <t>At the time of this writing, several host implementations do
        not handle the case where they have an IPv6 address configured
        and no IPv6 connectivity, either because the address itself
        has a limited topological reachability (e.g., ULA) or because
        the IPv6 CE router is not connected to the IPv6 network on its
        WAN interface. To support host implementations that do not
        handle multihoming in a multi-prefix environment <xref
        target="MULTIHOMING-WITHOUT-NAT"></xref>, the
        IPv6 CE router should not, as detailed in the requirements below,
        advertise itself as a default router on the LAN
        interface(s) when it does not have IPv6 connectivity on the
        WAN interface or when it is not provisioned with IPv6
        addresses. For local IPv6 communication, the mechanisms
        specified in <xref target="RFC4191"></xref> are used.</t>
        
        <t>ULA addressing is useful where the IPv6 CE router has
        multiple LAN interfaces with hosts that need to communicate
        with each other. If the IPv6 CE router has only a single LAN
        interface (IPv6 link), then link-local addressing can be used
        instead.</t>

        <t>In the event that more than one IPv6 CE router is present on the
        LAN, then coexistence with IPv4 requires all of them to
        conform to these recommendations, especially requirements
        ULA-5 and L-4 below.</t>

    <section title="Requirements">
      <section title="General Requirements">

        <t>The IPv6 CE router is responsible for implementing IPv6 routing;
        that is, the IPv6 CE router must look up the IPv6 destination address
        in its routing table to decide to which interface it should send the
        packet.</t>

        <t>In this role, the IPv6 CE router is responsible for ensuring that
        traffic using its ULA addressing does not go out the WAN interface,
        and does not originate from the WAN interface.</t>

        <t><list style='format G-%d:'>
          <t>An IPv6 CE router is an IPv6 node according to the <xref
          target="RFC4294"> IPv6 Node Requirements</xref>
          specification.</t>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST implement ICMP according to <xref
          target="RFC4443"></xref>. In particular, point-to-point links
          MUST be handled as described in Section 3.1 of <xref
          target="RFC4443"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST NOT forward any IPv6 traffic
          between its LAN interface(s) and its WAN interface until the
          router has successfully completed the IPv6 address
          acquisition process.</t>

          <t>By default, an IPv6 CE router that has no default
          router(s) on its WAN interface MUST NOT advertise itself as
          an IPv6 default router on its LAN interfaces. That is, the
          "Router Lifetime" field is set to zero in all Router
          Advertisement messages it originates <xref
          target="RFC4861"></xref>.</t>

          <t>By default, if the IPv6 CE router is an advertising router
          and loses its IPv6 default router(s) on the WAN interface,
          it MUST explicitly invalidate itself as an IPv6 default
          router on each of its advertising interfaces by immediately
          transmitting one or more Router Advertisement messages with
          the "Router Lifetime" field set to zero <xref
          target="RFC4861"></xref>.</t>

      </list></t>

      </section>

      <section title="WAN-Side Configuration">
        <t>The IPv6 CE router will need to support connectivity to one
        or more access network architectures. This document describes
        an IPv6 CE router that is not specific to any particular
        architecture or service provider and that supports all commonly
        used architectures.</t>

        <t>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and DHCPv6 protocols operate over
        any type of IPv6-supported link layer, and there is no need for
        a link-layer-specific configuration protocol for IPv6
        network-layer configuration options as in, e.g., PPP
        IP Control Protocol (IPCP) for IPv4. This
        section makes the assumption that the same mechanism will work
        for any link layer, be it Ethernet, the Data Over Cable Service
        Interface Specification (DOCSIS), PPP, or others.</t>

        <t>WAN-side requirements:
        <list style='format W-%d:'>
          <t>When the router is attached to the WAN interface link, it
          MUST act as an IPv6 host for the purposes of stateless <xref
          target="RFC4862"></xref> or stateful <xref target="RFC3315"></xref>
          interface address assignment.</t>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST generate a link-local address and
          finish Duplicate Address Detection according to <xref
          target="RFC4862"></xref> prior to sending any Router
          Solicitations on the interface. The source address used in
          the subsequent Router Solicitation MUST be the link-local
          address on the WAN interface.</t>

          <t>Absent other routing information, the IPv6 CE router
          MUST use Router Discovery as specified in <xref
          target="RFC4861"></xref> to discover a default router(s) and
          install default route(s) in its routing table with the
          discovered router's address as the next hop.</t>

          <t>The router MUST act as a requesting router for the
          purposes of DHCPv6 prefix delegation (<xref
          target="RFC3633"></xref>).</t>

          <t>DHCPv6 address assignment (IA_NA) and DHCPv6 prefix
          delegation (IA_PD) SHOULD be done as a single DHCPv6
          session.</t>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST use a persistent DHCP Unique Identifier
          (DUID) for DHCPv6
          messages. The DUID MUST NOT change between network interface
          resets or IPv6 CE router reboots.</t>

        <list style='format WLL-%d:'>
          <t>If the WAN interface supports Ethernet encapsulation,

          <xref target="RFC2464"></xref>.</t>

          <t>If the WAN interface supports PPP encapsulation, the IPv6
          CE router MUST support IPv6 over PPP <xref

	  <t>If the WAN interface supports PPP encapsulation, in a
	  dual-stack environment with IPCP and IPV6CP running over one
	  PPP logical channel, the Network Control Protocols (NCPs)
	  MUST be treated as independent of each other and start and

        <t>Address assignment requirements:<list style='format WAA-%d:'>
            <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support Stateless Address
            Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) <xref target="RFC4862"></xref>.</t>

            <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST follow the recommendations in
            Section 4 of <xref target="RFC5942"></xref>, and in
            particular the handling of the L flag in the Router
            Advertisement Prefix Information option.</t>

            <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support DHCPv6 <xref
            target="RFC3315"></xref> client behavior.</t>

            <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST be able to support the
            following DHCPv6 options: IA_NA, Reconfigure Accept <xref
            target="RFC3315"></xref>, and DNS_SERVERS <xref
            target="RFC3646"></xref>.</t>

            <t>The IPv6 CE router SHOULD support the DHCPv6
            Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP)
            option <xref target="RFC4075"></xref> and the Information
            Refresh Time option <xref target="RFC4242"></xref>.</t>

            <t>If the IPv6 CE router receives a Router
            Advertisement message (described
            in <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>) with the M flag set to
            1, the IPv6 CE router MUST do DHCPv6 address assignment
            (request an IA_NA option).</t>

            <t>If the IPv6 CE router is unable to assign address(es)
            through SLAAC, it MAY do DHCPv6 address assignment (request
            an IA_NA option) even if the M flag is set to 0.</t>

            <t>If the IPv6 CE router does not acquire global IPv6
            address(es) from either SLAAC or DHCPv6, then it MUST
            create global IPv6 address(es) from its delegated
            prefix(es) and configure those on one of its internal
            virtual network interfaces.</t>

            <t>As a router, the IPv6 CE router MUST follow the weak host (Weak ES)
model <xref target="RFC1122"></xref>. When
            originating packets from an interface, it will use a source
            address from another one of its interfaces if the outgoing
            interface does not have an address of suitable scope.</t>

        <t>Prefix delegation requirements:
        <list style='format WPD-%d:'>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support DHCPv6 prefix delegation
          requesting router behavior as specified in <xref
          target="RFC3633"></xref> (IA_PD option).</t>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router MAY indicate as a hint to the
          delegating router the size of the prefix it requires. If so,
          it MUST ask for a prefix large enough to assign one /64 for
          each of its interfaces, rounded up to the nearest nibble, and
          MUST be configurable to ask for more.</t>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST be prepared to accept a delegated
          prefix size different from what is given in the hint. If the
          delegated prefix is too small to address all of its
          interfaces, the IPv6 CE router SHOULD log a system
          management error.</t>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST always initiate DHCPv6 prefix
          delegation, regardless of the M and O flags in a received
          Router Advertisement message.</t>

          <t>If the IPv6 CE router initiates DHCPv6 before receiving a
          Router Advertisement, it MUST also request an IA_NA option in
          DHCPv6.</t>

          <t>If the delegated prefix(es) are aggregate route(s) of
          multiple, more-specific routes, the IPv6 CE router MUST
          discard packets that match the aggregate route(s), but not
          any of the more-specific routes. In other words, the
          next hop for the aggregate route(s) should be the null
          destination. This is necessary to prevent forwarding loops
          when some addresses covered by the aggregate are not
          reachable <xref target="RFC4632"></xref>.

          <list style="format (%c)">
            <t>The IPv6 CE router SHOULD send an ICMPv6 Destination
            Unreachable message in accordance with <xref target="RFC4443">
            Section 3.1 of</xref> back to the source of the packet, if the packet
            is to be dropped due to this rule.</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>If the IPv6 CE router requests both an IA_NA and an IA_PD
          option in DHCPv6, it MUST accept an IA_PD option
          in DHCPv6 Advertise/Reply
          messages, even if the message does not contain any
          addresses.</t>

          <t>By default, an IPv6 CE router MUST NOT initiate any

        <t>The IPv6 CE router distributes configuration information obtained
        during WAN interface provisioning to IPv6 hosts and assists IPv6 hosts
        in obtaining IPv6 addresses. It also supports connectivity of these
        devices in the absence of any working WAN interface.</t>

        <t>An IPv6 CE router is expected to support an IPv6 end-user
        network and IPv6 hosts that exhibit the following
        characteristics:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Link-local addresses may be insufficient for allowing
            IPv6 applications to communicate with each other in the

            this communication by providing globally scoped unicast
            addresses or ULAs <xref target="RFC4193"></xref>, whether
            or not WAN connectivity exists.</t>

            <t>IPv6 hosts should be capable of using SLAAC and may be

            information, such as the DNS_SERVERS option for acquiring
            DNS information.</t>

        </list></t>

        <t>Unless otherwise specified, the following requirements
        apply to the IPv6 CE router's LAN interfaces only.</t>

        <t>ULA requirements:<list style='format ULA-%d:'>

            <t>The IPv6 CE router SHOULD be capable of generating a ULA
            prefix <xref target="RFC4193"></xref>.</t>

          <t>An IPv6 CE router with a ULA prefix MUST maintain this
          prefix consistently across reboots.</t>

          <t>The value of the ULA prefix SHOULD be user-configurable.</t>

          <t>By default, the IPv6 CE router MUST act as a site border
          router according to Section 4.3 of <xref
          target="RFC4193"></xref> and filter packets with local IPv6
          source or destination addresses accordingly.</t>

          <t>An IPv6 CE router MUST NOT advertise itself as a default
          router with a Router Lifetime greater than zero whenever all
          of its configured and delegated prefixes are ULA
          prefixes.</t>

        </list></t>

        <t>LAN requirements:<list style='format L-%d:'>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support router behavior according
          to Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 <xref
          target="RFC4861"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST assign a separate /64 from its
          delegated prefix(es) (and ULA prefix if configured to
          provide ULA addressing) for each of its LAN interfaces.</t>

          <t>An IPv6 CE router MUST advertise itself as a router for
          the delegated prefix(es) (and ULA prefix if configured to
          provide ULA addressing) using the "Route Information Option"
          specified in Section 2.3 of <xref
          target="RFC4191"></xref>. This advertisement is independent
          of having or not having IPv6 connectivity on the WAN interface.</t>

          <t>An IPv6 CE router MUST NOT advertise itself as a default
          router with a Router Lifetime <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>
          greater than zero if it has no prefixes configured or
          delegated to it.</t>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST make each LAN interface an
          advertising interface according to [RFC4861].</t>

          <t>In Router Advertisement messages, the Prefix Information
          option's A and L flags MUST be set to 1 by default.</t>

          <t>The A and L flags' settings SHOULD be user-configurable.</t>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support a DHCPv6 server capable
          of IPv6 address assignment according to <xref
          target="RFC3315"></xref> OR a stateless DHCPv6 server
          according to <xref target="RFC3736"></xref> on its LAN
          interfaces.</t>

          <t>Unless the IPv6 CE router is configured to support the
          DHCPv6 IA_NA option, it SHOULD set the M flag to 0 and
          the O flag to 1 in its Router
          Advertisement messages <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>.</t>
          
          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support providing DNS information
          in the DHCPv6 DNS_SERVERS and DOMAIN_LIST options <xref
          target="RFC3646"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router SHOULD support providing DNS
          information in the Router Advertisement
          Recursive DNS Server (RDNSS) and
          DNS Search List (DNSSL) options
          as specified in <xref target="RFC6106"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router SHOULD make available a subset of
          DHCPv6 options (as listed in Section 5.3 of <xref
          target="RFC3736"></xref>) received from the DHCPv6 client on
          its WAN interface to its LAN-side DHCPv6 server.</t>

          <t>If the delegated prefix changes, i.e., the current prefix
          is replaced with a new prefix without any overlapping time
          period, then the IPv6 CE router MUST immediately advertise
          the old prefix with a Preferred Lifetime of zero and a Valid
          Lifetime of the lower of the current Valid Lifetime and
          2 hours (which must be decremented in real time) in a
          Router Advertisement message as described in Section 5.5.3, (e)
          of <xref target="RFC4862"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST send an ICMP Destination
          Unreachable message, code 5 (Source address failed
          ingress/egress policy) for packets forwarded to it that use
          an address from a prefix that has been deprecated.</t>

      <section title="Security Considerations">
        <t>It is considered a best practice to filter obviously malicious
        traffic (e.g., spoofed packets, "Martian" addresses, etc.).  Thus, the
        IPv6 CE router ought to support basic stateless egress and ingress
        filters.  The CE router is also expected to offer mechanisms to filter
        traffic entering the customer network; however, the method by which
        vendors implement configurable packet filtering is beyond the scope of
        this document.</t>

        <t>Security requirements:<list style='format S-%d:'>
            <t>The IPv6 CE router SHOULD support
