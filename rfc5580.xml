      <t>This document describes procedures for conveying
      access-network ownership and location information based on 
      civic and geospatial location formats in Remote Authentication Dial-In User
      Service (RADIUS) and Diameter.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

      <t> This document defines attributes within RADIUS and Diameter
      that can be used to convey location-related information within
      authentication and accounting exchanges. </t>

      <t> Location information may be useful in a number of
        scenarios. Wireless networks (including wireless LAN) are
        being deployed in public places such as airports, hotels,
        shopping malls, and coffee shops by a diverse set of operators
        such as cellular network operators, Wireless Internet Service
        Providers (WISPs), and fixed broadband operators. In these
        situations, the home network may need to know the location of
        the user in order to enable location-aware billing,
        location-aware authorization, or other location-aware
        services. Location information can also prove useful in other
        situations (such as wired networks) where operator-network
        ownership and location information may be needed by the home
        network. </t>

      <t> In order to preserve user privacy, location information
      needs to be protected against unauthorized access and
      distribution. Requirements for access to location information
      are defined in <xref target="RFC3693"/>. The model includes a
      Location Generator (LG) that creates location information, a
      Location Server (LS) that authorizes access to location
      information, a Location Recipient (LR) that requests and
      receives information, and a Rule Maker (RM) that provides
      authorization policies to the LS, which enforces access-control
      policies on requests to location information. In
      <xref target="geopriv-requirements"/>, the requirements for a
      GEOPRIV using protocol <xref target="RFC3693" /> are compared to the functionality
      provided by this document.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
      in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

      <t>RADIUS-specific terminology is borrowed from <xref target="RFC2865"/> and <xref
          target="RFC2866"/>.</t>

      <t>Terminology related to privacy issues, location information,
      and authorization policy rules is taken from
      <xref target="RFC3693"/>.</t>

    <!-- ====================================================================== -->

    <section title="Delivery Methods for Location Information">

      <t>The following exchanges show how location information is
        conveyed in RADIUS. In describing the usage scenarios, we
        assume that privacy policies allow location to be conveyed in
        RADIUS; however, as noted in <xref target="diameter-radius"/>,
        similar exchanges can also take place within Diameter. Privacy
        issues are discussed in <xref target="privacy"/>.</t>

      <section title="Location Delivery Based on Out-of-Band
        Agreements">

        <t> <xref target="initial-auth-delivery"/> shows an example
          message flow for delivering location information during the
          network-access authentication and authorization
          procedure. Upon a network-authentication request from an
          access-network client, the Network Access Server (NAS)
          submits a RADIUS Access-Request message that contains
          Location-Information Attributes among other required
          attributes. In this scenario, location information is
          attached to the Access-Request message without an explicit
          request from the RADIUS server. Note that such an approach
          with a prior agreement between the RADIUS client and the
          RADIUS server is only applicable in certain environments,
          such as in situations where the RADIUS client and server are
          within the same administrative domain. The
          Basic-Location-Policy-Rules Attribute is populated based on
          the defaults described in
          <xref target="Basic-Location-Policy-Rules" />, unless it has
          been explicitly configured otherwise. </t>

      <section title="Location Delivery Based on Initial Request">
        <t>If the RADIUS client provides a Location-Capable Attribute
          in the Access-Request, then the RADIUS server MAY request
          location information from the RADIUS client if it requires
          that information for authorization and if location
          information was not provided in the Access-Request.
          This exchange is shown
          in <xref target="challenge"/>. The inclusion of the
          Location-Capable Attribute in an Access-Request message
          indicates that the NAS is capable of providing location data
          in response to an Access-Challenge. The subsequent
          Access-Challenge message sent from the RADIUS server to the
          NAS provides a hint regarding the type of desired
          Location-Information Attributes. The NAS treats the
          Basic-Location-Policy-Rules and
          Extended-Location-Policy-Rules Attributes as opaque data
          (e.g., it echoes these rules provided by the server within
          the Access-Challenge back in the Access-Request). In the
          shown message flow, the location attributes are then provided
          in the subsequent Access-Request message. When evaluating
          this Access-Request message, the authorization procedure at
          the RADIUS server might be based on a number of criteria,
          including the newly defined attributes listed in
          <xref target="attributes"/>.</t>

      <section title="Location Delivery Based on Mid-Session Request">
        <t> The on-demand, mid-session location-delivery method
        utilizes the Change-of-Authorization Request (CoA-Request)
        message and the CoA-NAK (CoA-Negative Acknowledgement), defined in
        <xref target="RFC5176"/>. At any time during the session, the
        Dynamic Authorization Client MAY send a CoA-Request containing
        session-identification attributes to the NAS (i.e., Dynamic
        Authorization Server). </t>

        <t>In order to enable the on-demand, mid-session
 location-delivery method, the RADIUS server MUST return an instance
          of the Requested-Location-Info Attribute with the
          'FUTURE_REQUESTS' flag set and instances of the
          Basic-Location-Policy-Rules and
          Extended-Location-Policy-Rules Attributes in the
          Access-Accept message for the session. Upon receipt of a
          CoA-Request message containing a Service-Type Attribute with
          value "Authorize Only" for the same session, the NAS MUST
          include location information and echo the previously
          received Basic-Location-Policy-Rules and
          Extended-Location-Policy-Rules Attributes in the subsequent
          Access-Request message. </t>


        <t>Upon receiving the Access-Request message containing the
        Service-Type Attribute with a
          value of Authorize-Only from the NAS, the RADIUS server responds with either an
          Access-Accept or an Access-Reject message.</t>

        <t> The use of dynamic authorization <xref target="RFC5176"/>
        is necessary when location
          information is needed on-demand and cannot be obtained from
        accounting information in a timely fashion. </t>

        <t> When the Dynamic Authorization Client wants to change the values of the requested
          location information, or set the values of the requested
          location information for the first time, it may do so without triggering a
          reauthorization. Assuming that the NAS had previously sent
          an Access-Request containing a
          Location-Capable Attribute, the Dynamic Authorization Client (DAC) can
          send a CoA-Request to the NAS without a Service-Type
          Attribute, but include the NAS
          identifiers and session identifiers as per <xref target="RFC5176"/> and the
          Requested-Location-Info, Basic-Location-Policy-Rules, and
          Extended-Location-Policy-Rules Attributes. The
          Requested-Location-Info, Basic-Location-Policy-Rules, and
          Extended-Location-Policy-Rules Attributes MUST NOT be used
          for session identification. </t>

      <section title="Location Delivery in Accounting Messages">
        <t>Location information may also be reported in accounting
          messages. Accounting messages are generated when the session
          starts, when the session stops, and periodically during the
          lifetime of the session. Accounting messages may also be
          generated when the user roams during handoff.</t>

        <t>Accounting information may be needed by the billing system
        to calculate the user's bill.
          For example, there may be different tariffs or tax rates
        applied based on the location.</t>

        <t>If the RADIUS server needs to obtain location information
        in accounting messages, then it needs to include a
        Requested-Location-Info Attribute with the Access-Accept
        message. The Basic-Location-Policy-Rules and the
        Extended-Location-Policy-Rules Attributes are to be
          echoed in the Accounting-Request if indicated in the
        Access-Accept. </t>

      the RADIUS server. Instead, a location-server-specific
        component used in combination with the RADIUS server is responsible for receiving,
        processing, and further distributing location information (in
      combination with proper access control and privacy
      protection). As such, from a RADIUS server point of view,
      location information is treated as opaque data. </t>

      4.1 of <xref target="RFC3588" /> and Section 9 of
      <xref target="RFC4005"/>.</t>

      <t> What this specification says about the applicability of the
      attributes for RADIUS Access-Request packets applies in
      Diameter to AA-Request <xref target="RFC4005"/> or

      about Access-Challenge applies in Diameter to AA-Answer
      <xref target="RFC4005"/> or Diameter-EAP-Answer
      <xref target="RFC4072"/> with the Result-Code AVP set to
      DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH. What is said about Access-Accept
      applies in Diameter to AA-Answer or Diameter-EAP-Answer
      messages that indicate success. Similarly, what is said about RADIUS
      Access-Reject packets applies in Diameter to AA-Answer or

    <section anchor="security-section" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>A number of security aspects are relevant for the
      distribution of location information via
        RADIUS. These aspects are discussed in separate
      subsections.</t>

      <section anchor="comsec" title="Communication Security">
        <t>Requirements for the protection of a Location Object are
        defined in <xref target="RFC3693"/> -- namely, mutual
        end-point authentication, data object integrity, data object
        confidentiality, and replay protection. </t>

        <t>If no authentication, integrity, and replay protection
        between the participating RADIUS entities is provided, then
        adversaries can spoof and modify transmitted attributes. Two
        security mechanisms are proposed for RADIUS:</t>

        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              <xref target="RFC2865"/> proposes the usage of a static
              key that raised concerns regarding the lack of dynamic
              key management. At the time of writing, work is ongoing
              to address some shortcomings of the <xref target="RFC2865"/>
              attribute regarding security protection.</t>

            <t>RADIUS over IPsec <xref target="RFC3579"/> enables the
              use of standard key-management mechanisms, such as
              Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys (KINK), the
              Internet Key Exchange Protocol (IKE), and IKEv2
              <xref target="RFC4306"/>, to establish IPsec
              security associations. Confidentiality protection MUST
              be used to prevent an eavesdropper from gaining access
              to location information. Confidentiality protection is
              already present for other reasons in many environments,
              such as for the transport of keying material in
              the context of Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
              authentication and authorization. Hence, this
              requirement is, in many environments, already fulfilled. Mutual
              authentication MUST be provided between neighboring
              RADIUS entities to prevent man-in-the-middle
              attacks. Since mutual authentication is already required
              for key transport within RADIUS messages, it does
              not represent a deployment obstacle. Since IPsec
              protection is already suggested as a mechanism to
              protect RADIUS, no additional considerations need to be
              addressed beyond those described in
              <xref target="RFC3579"/>. </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>In case IPsec protection is not available for some reason
          and RADIUS-specific security mechanisms have to be used, then
          the following considerations apply. The Access-Request
          message is not integrity protected. This would allow an
          adversary to change the contents of the Location Object or
          to insert, modify, and delete attributes or individual
          fields. To address these problems, the Message-Authenticator
          (80) can be used to integrity protect the entire
          Access-Request packet. The Message-Authenticator (80) is
          also required when EAP is used and, hence, is supported by
          many modern RADIUS servers.</t>

        <t>Access-Request packets including location attribute(s) without a
          Message-Authenticator (80) Attribute SHOULD be silently
          discarded by the RADIUS server. A RADIUS server supporting
          location attributes MUST calculate the correct value of the
          Message-Authenticator (80) and MUST silently discard the
          packet if it does not match the value sent.</t>

        <t>Access-Accept messages, including location attribute(s), without a
Message-Authenticator (80) Attribute SHOULD be silently
discarded by the NAS.
         An NAS supporting location attributes MUST calculate the
        correct value of a received Message-Authenticator (80) and MUST
        silently discard the packet if it does not match the value sent.</t>

        <t>RADIUS and Diameter make some assumptions about the trust
        between traversed RADIUS entities in the sense that
        object-level security is not provided by either RADIUS or
          Diameter. Hence, some trust has to be placed on the RADIUS
        entities to behave according to the defined
        rules. Furthermore, the RADIUS protocol does not involve the
        user in their protocol interaction except for tunneling
        authentication information (such as EAP messages) through
        their infrastructure. RADIUS and Diameter have even become a
        de facto protocol for key distribution for network-access
        authentication applications. Hence, in the past there were
        some concerns about the trust placed into the infrastructure --
          particularly from the security area --  when it comes to
        keying. The EAP keying infrastructure is described in
        <xref target="RFC4282"/>.</t>

      <section anchor="privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">
        <t>This section discusses privacy implications for the
        distribution of location information within RADIUS. Note also
        that it is possible for the RADIUS server to obtain some
        amount of location information from the NAS identifier. This
        document, however, describes procedures to convey more
        accurate location information about the end host and/or the
          network. In a number of deployment environments, location
        information about the network also reveals the current
        location of the user with a certain degree of precision,
        depending on the location-determination mechanism used, the update
        frequency, the size of the network, and other factors, such as

          <t>The RADIUS server is a natural place for storing

      <section title="Identity Information and Location Information">
        <t>For the envisioned usage scenarios, the identity of the
        user and his device is tightly coupled to the transfer of
        location information. If the identity can be determined by the
          visited network or RADIUS brokers, then it is possible to
        correlate location information with a particular user. As
        such, it allows the visited network and brokers to learn the
        movement patterns of users.</t>

        <t>The user's identity can be "leaked" to the visited network
        or RADIUS brokers in a number of ways:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>The user's device may employ a fixed Media Access
            Control (MAC) address or base its IP address on such an
            address. This enables the correlation of the particular
            device to its different locations. Techniques exist to
            avoid the use of an IP address that is based on a MAC
              address <xref target="RFC4941"/>. Some link layers make
            it possible to avoid MAC addresses or change them
            dynamically.</t>

            <t>Network-access authentication procedures, such as the PPP
              Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)
              <xref target="RFC1994"/>
              or EAP <xref target="RFC4187"/>, may reveal the user's
              identity as a part of the authentication
              procedure. Techniques exist to avoid this problem in EAP
              methods, for instance by employing private Network
              Access Identifiers (NAIs) <xref target="RFC4282"/> in
              the EAP Identity Response message  and by
              method-specific private identity
              exchanges in the EAP method (e.g.,
              <xref target="RFC4187"/>, <xref target="RFC5281"/>,
              <xref target="PEAP"/>, and
              <xref target="RFC5106"/>). Support
              for identity privacy within CHAP is not available.</t>

            <t>RADIUS may return information from the home network to
              the visited one in a manner that makes it possible to
              either identify the user or at least correlate his
              session with other sessions, such as the use of static
              data in a Class Attribute <xref target="RFC2865"/> or in
              some accounting attribute usage scenarios
              <xref target="RFC4372"/>.</t>

            <t>Mobility protocols may reveal some long-term
            identifier, such as a home address.</t>

            <t>Application-layer protocols may reveal other permanent
            identifiers.</t>

          </list>
        </t>

        <t>To prevent the correlation of identities with location
        information, it is necessary to prevent leakage of identity
        information from all sources, not just one. </t>

        <t>Unfortunately, most users are not educated about the
        importance of identity confidentiality, and some protocols
        lack support for identity-privacy mechanisms. This problem is
        made worse by the fact that users may be unable to choose
        particular protocols, as the choice is often dictated by the
        type of network operator they use, the type of network they
        wish to access, the kind of equipment they have, or the type
        of authentication method they are using.</t>

        <t>A scenario where the user is attached to the home network
          is, from a privacy point of view, simpler than a scenario
          where a user roams into a visited network, since the NAS and
          the home RADIUS server are in the same administrative
          domain. No direct relationship between the visited and the
          home network operator may be available, and some RADIUS
          brokers need to be consulted. With subscription-based
          network access as used today, the user has a contractual
          relationship with the home network provider that could
          (theoretically) allow higher privacy considerations to be
          applied (including policy rules stored at the home network
          itself, for the purpose of restricting further
          distribution).</t>

        <t>In many cases it is necessary to secure the transport of location information along the
          RADIUS infrastructure. Mechanisms to achieve this functionality are discussed in <xref target="comsec"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="geopriv-requirements" title="Matching with GEOPRIV Requirements">
      <t>This section compares the requirements for a GEOPRIV using
      protocol, described in <xref target="RFC3693"/>, against the
      approach of distributing Location Objects with RADIUS.</t>

      <t>In Appendices <xref format="counter" target="match-1"/> and
        <xref format="counter" target="match-2"/>, we discuss privacy implications
        when RADIUS entities make location information available to
        other parties. In <xref target="req-match"/>, the requirements
        are matched against these two scenarios.</t>

      <section anchor="match-1"
        title="Distribution of Location Information at the User's Home Network">
        <t>When location information is conveyed from the RADIUS
        client to the RADIUS server, then it might subsequently be
        made available for different purposes. This section discusses
        the privacy implications for making location information
        available to other entities.</t>

        <t> To use a more generic scenario, we assume that the visited
        RADIUS and the home RADIUS server belong to different
        administrative domains. The Location Recipient obtains
        location information about a particular Target via protocols
        specified outside the scope of this document (e.g., SIP, HTTP,
        or an API).</t>

        <t>This section describes a scenario where location
        information is made available to Location Recipients by a
        Location Server in the visited network. Some identifier needs
        to be used as an index within the location database. One
        possible identifier is the Network Access Identifier. RFC 4282
        <xref target="RFC4282"/> and RFC 4372 <xref target="RFC4372"/>
        provide background regarding whether entities in the visited network can
        obtain the user's NAI in cleartext. </t>

        <t>The visited network provides location information to a
          Location Recipient (e.g., via SIP or HTTP). This document
          enables the NAS to obtain the user's privacy policy via the
          interaction with the RADIUS server. Otherwise, only default
          policies, which are very restrictive, are available. This
          allows the Location Server in the visited network to ensure they

      <t>Location information always travels with privacy
      policies. This document enables the RADIUS
        client to obtain these policies. The Location Server can
      subsequently act according to these
        policies to provide access control using the
      Extended-Location-Policy-Rules and to adhere to
        the privacy statements in the Basic-Location-Policy-Rules.</t>

      <section anchor="req-match" title="Requirements Matching">
        <t>Section 7.1 of <xref target="RFC3693"/> details the
        requirements of a "Location Object".
          We discuss these requirements in the subsequent list.</t>

        <t>
          <list style="hanging">

            <t hangText="Req. 1.  (Location Object generalities):">
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>Regarding requirement 1.1, the syntax and semantics
                of the Location Object are
                  taken from <xref target="RFC3825"/> and
                <xref target="RFC4776"/>. It is
                  furthermore possible to convert it to the format
                used in the Geography Markup Language (GMLv3)
                <xref target="GMLv3"/>, as used with
                PIDF-LO <xref target="RFC4119"/>. </t>

                <t>Regarding requirement 1.2, a number of fields in
                the civic location-information format are
                optional.</t>

                <t>Regarding requirement 1.3, the inclusion of type of place item (CAtype 29) used
                  in the DHCP civic format gives a further classification of the location. This
                  attribute can be seen as an extension.</t>
                <t>Regarding requirement 1.4, this document does not define the format of the
                  location information. </t>
                <t>Regarding requirement 1.5, location information is only sent from the RADIUS
                  client to the RADIUS server.</t>
                <t>Regarding requirement 1.6, the Location Object contains both location information
                  and privacy rules. Location information is described
                  in Sections <xref format="counter"
                  target="Location-Information-Attribute-Attr" />,
                  <xref format="counter" target="civic-profile" />,
                  and <xref format="counter"
                  target="geo-profile"/>. The corresponding privacy
                  rules are detailed in Sections
                  <xref format="counter" target="Basic-Location-Policy-Rules"/> and 
                  <xref format="counter" target="Extended-Location-Policy-Rules"/>.</t>

                <t>Regarding requirement 1.7, the Location Object is
                usable in a variety of protocols. The format of the
                object is reused from other documents, as detailed in
                Sections <xref format="counter"
                target="Location-Information-Attribute-Attr"/>,
                <xref format="counter" target="civic-profile"/>,
                <xref format="counter" target="geo-profile"/>,
                  <xref format="counter"
                target="Basic-Location-Policy-Rules"/>, and
                <xref format="counter"
                target="Extended-Location-Policy-Rules"/>.</t>

                <t>Regarding requirement 1.8, the encoding of the Location Object has an emphasis on
                  a lightweight encoding format to be used with RADIUS.</t>
              </list>

            </t>
            <t hangText="Req. 2.  (Location Object fields):">
              <list style="symbols">

                <t>Regarding requirement 2.1, the target identifier is
                carried within the network-access authentication
                protocol (e.g., within the EAP-Identity Response when
                EAP is used and/or within the EAP method itself). As
                described in <xref target="privacy" /> of this
                document, it has a number of advantages if this
                identifier is not carried in clear. This is possible
                with certain EAP methods whereby the identity in the
                EAP-Identity Response only contains information
                relevant for routing the response to the user's home
                network. The user identity is protected by the
                authentication and key exchange protocol.</t>

                <t>Regarding requirement 2.2, the Location Recipient
                is, in the main scenario, the home RADIUS server. For
                a scenario where the Location Recipient is obtaining
                location information from the Location Server via HTTP
                or SIP, the respective mechanisms defined in these
                protocols are used to identify the recipient. The
                Location Generator cannot, a priori, know the
                recipients if they are not defined in this
                protocol.</t>

                <t>Regarding requirement 2.3, the credentials of the
                Location Recipient are known to
                  the RADIUS entities based on the security mechanisms
                defined in the RADIUS protocol
                itself. <xref target="security-section"/> of this
                document describes these security
                  mechanisms offered by the RADIUS protocol. The same
                is true for requirement 2.4.</t>

                <t>Regarding requirement 2.5, Sections
                  <xref format="counter"
                  target="Location-Information-Attribute-Attr"/>,
                  <xref format="counter" target="civic-profile"/>, and
                  <xref format="counter" target="geo-profile"/> describe the
                  content of the Location fields. Since the location
                  format itself is not defined in this document,
                  motion and direction vectors as listed in
                  requirement 2.6 are not defined. </t>

                <t>Regarding requirement 2.6, this document provides
                the capability for the RADIUS server to indicate what
                type of location information it would like to see from
                the RADIUS client. </t>

                <t>Regarding requirement 2.7, timing information is
                    provided with the 'Sighting Time' and
                    'Time-to-Live' fields defined in
                    <xref target="Location-Information-Attribute-Attr"/>.</t>

                <t>Regarding requirement 2.8, a reference to an
                external (more detailed ruleset) is provided with the
                Extended-Location-Policy-Rules Attribute in
                <xref target="Extended-Location-Policy-Rules"/>.</t>

                <t>Regarding requirement 2.9, security headers and
                trailers are provided as part of the RADIUS protocol
                or even as part of IPsec.</t>

                <t>Regarding requirement 2.10, a version number in
                RADIUS is provided with the IANA registration of the
                attributes. New attributes are assigned a new IANA
                number.</t>
              </list>

        <t>Section 7.2 of <xref target="RFC3693"/> details the

          These requirements are listed below.
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Req. 4.:">The using protocol has to obey the
            privacy and security instructions coded in the Location
            Object (LO) regarding the transmission and storage of the
            LO. This document requires that entities that aim to make
            location information available to third parties be
            required to obey the privacy instructions.

            <t hangText="Req. 5.:">The using protocol will typically
            facilitate that the keys associated with the credentials
            are transported to the respective parties, that is, key
            establishment is the responsibility of the using
            protocol. <xref target="security-section"/> of this
            document specifies how security mechanisms are used in RADIUS and
              how they can be reused to provide security protection
            for the Location Object. Additionally, the privacy
            considerations (see <xref target="privacy"/>) are also

        <t>Section 7.3 of <xref target="RFC3693"/> details the

        requirements are listed below.

          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Req. 7.  (LS Rules):">With the scenario shown in <xref
                target="req-scenario-1"/>, the decision of a Location
                Server to provide a Location Recipient access to
                location information is based on Rule Maker-defined
                privacy rules that are stored at the home
                network. With regard to the scenario shown in
                <xref target="req-scenario-2"/>, the Rule
                Maker-defined privacy rules are sent from the RADIUS
                server to the NAS (see Sections <xref format="counter"
                target="Basic-Location-Policy-Rules"/>,
                <xref format="counter"
                target="Extended-Location-Policy-Rules"/>, and

              before transmitting location information from the NAS to
              the RADIUS server or even to third parties. In the case
              of an out-of-band agreement between the owner of the NAS
              and the owner of the RADIUS server, privacy might be
              applied on a higher granularity. For the scenario shown
              in <xref target="req-scenario-1"/>, the visited network
              is already in possession of the user's location
              information prior to the authentication and
              authorization of the user. A correlation between the
              location and the user identity might, however, still not
              be possible for the visited network (as explained in
              <xref target="privacy"/>). A Location
              Server in the visited network has to evaluate available
              rulesets.

            <t hangText="Req. 9.  (Viewer Rules):">The Rule Maker

              unlinkable pseudonyms is provided by the usage of a
              corresponding authentication and key-exchange
              protocol. Such protocols are available, for example,
              with the support of EAP as network-access authentication
              methods. Some EAP methods support passive user-identity
              confidentiality, whereas others even support active
              user-identity confidentiality. This issue is further
              discussed in <xref target="security-section"/>. The

                signaling messages can be protected with IPsec. This

            data object integrity, data object confidentiality, and replay
            protection. As described in
                <xref target="security-section"/>, these requirements
            are fulfilled with the usage of
