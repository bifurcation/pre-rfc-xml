    <abstract>
      <t>Procedures and protocol mechanisms to enable efficient and accurate
      measurement of packet loss, delay, and throughput in MPLS networks are
      defined in RFC 6374.</t>

      <t>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the set of MPLS protocol
      functions applicable to the construction and operation of packet-
      switched transport networks.</t>

      <t>This document describes a profile of the general MPLS loss, delay,
      and throughput measurement techniques that suffices to meet the specific
      requirements of MPLS-TP.</t>

      <t>This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
      (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
      Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
      Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge
      (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of
      a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Procedures for the measurement of packet loss, delay, and throughput
      in MPLS networks are defined in <xref target="RFC6374"
      />.  This document describes a profile, i.e., a simplified subset, of
      these procedures that suffices to meet the specific requirements of
      MPLS-based transport networks <xref target="RFC5921" /> as defined in
      <xref target="RFC5860" />.  This profile is presented for the
      convenience of implementors who are concerned exclusively with the
      transport network context.</t>

      <t>The use of the profile specified in this document is purely optional.
      Implementors wishing to provide enhanced functionality that is within
      the scope of <xref target="RFC6374" /> but outside the
      scope of this profile may do so, whether or not the implementation is
      restricted to the transport network context.</t>

      <t>The assumption of this profile is that the devices involved in a
      measurement operation are configured for measurement by a means
      external to the measurement protocols themselves, for example, via a
      Network Management System (NMS) or separate configuration protocol.
      The manageability considerations in <xref
      target="RFC6374" /> apply, and further information
      on MPLS-TP network management can be found in <xref target="RFC5950"
      />.</t>

      <t>This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
      (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
      Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
      Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge
      (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of
      a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</t>

    <section title="MPLS-TP Measurement Considerations">
      <t>The measurement considerations discussed in Section 2.9 of <xref
      target="RFC6374" /> apply also in the context of
      MPLS-TP, except for the following, which pertain to topologies excluded
      from MPLS-TP:

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Equal Cost Multipath considerations (Section 2.9.4 of <xref
          target="RFC6374" />)</t>

          <t>Considerations for direct Loss Measurement (LM) in the presence
          of Label Switched Paths constructed via the Label Distribution
          Protocol (LDP) or utilizing Penultimate Hop Popping (Section 2.9.8
          of <xref target="RFC6374" />)</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Packet Loss Measurement (LM) Profile">
      <t>When an LM session is externally configured, the values of several
      protocol parameters can be fixed in advance at the endpoints involved in
      the session, so that negotiation of these parameters is not required.
      These parameters, and their default values as specified by this profile,
      are as follows:</t>

        <texttable align="left" style="headers">
          <ttcol width="60%">Parameter</ttcol>
          <ttcol>Default Value</ttcol>

          <c>Query control code</c>
          <c>In-band Response Requested</c>

          <c>Byte/packet Count (B) Flag</c>
          <c>Packet count</c>

          <c>Traffic-class-specific (T) Flag</c>
          <c>Traffic-class-scoped</c>

          <c>Origin Timestamp Format (OTF)</c>
          <c>Truncated IEEE 1588v2</c>
        </texttable>

       <t>A simple implementation may assume that external configuration will
       ensure that both ends of the communication are using the default values
       for these parameters.  However, implementations are strongly advised
       to validate the values of these parameters in received messages so that
       configuration inconsistencies can be detected and reported.</t>

       <t>LM message rates (and test message rates, when inferred LM is used)
       should be configurable by the network operator on a per-channel basis.
       The following intervals should be supported:</t>

        <texttable align="left" style="headers">
          <ttcol width="20%">Message Type</ttcol>
          <ttcol>Supported Intervals</ttcol>

          <c>LM Message</c>
          <c>100 milliseconds, 1 second, 10 seconds, 1 minute, 10 minutes</c>

          <c>Test Message</c>
          <c>10 milliseconds, 100 milliseconds, 1 second, 10 seconds, 1 minute</c>
        </texttable>
    </section>

    <section title="Packet Delay Measurement (DM) Profile">
      <t>When a DM session is externally configured, the values of several
      protocol parameters can be fixed in advance at the endpoints involved in
      the session, so that negotiation of these parameters is not required.
      These parameters, and their default values as specified by this profile,
      are as follows:</t>

          <c>Responder Timestamp Format (RTF)</c>

          <c>Truncated IEEE 1588v2</c>

      <t>This document delineates a subset of the procedures specified in

      considerations discussed in <xref target="RFC6374"

<abstract><t>Many service provider service level agreements (SLAs) depend on the ability to measure and monitor performance metrics for packet loss and one-way and two-way delay, as well as related metrics such as delay variation and channel throughput.  This measurement capability also provides operators with greater visibility into the performance characteristics of their networks, thereby facilitating planning, troubleshooting, and evaluation.  This document specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and accurate measurement of these performance metrics in MPLS networks.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>This document provides a security framework for Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  Extended from MPLS technologies, MPLS-TP introduces new OAM capabilities, transport oriented path protection mechanism, and strong emphasis on static provisioning supported by network management systems.  This document addresses the security aspects that are relevant in the context of MPLS-TP specifically.  It describes the security requirements for MPLS-TP; potential securities threats and migration procedures for MPLS-TP networks and MPLS-TP inter-connection to MPLS and GMPLS networks.  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.  This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving IETF Consensus before publication as an RFC and will be subject to an IETF Last Call.  [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC and insert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published RFC has IETF Consensus.]</t></abstract>
