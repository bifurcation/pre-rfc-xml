		<t> This document defines an additional header field for
		    use in Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) reports to permit the

	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> <xref target="ARF"/> defined the Abuse Reporting Format,
		    an extensible message format for Email Feedback Reports.
		    These reports are used to report incidents of email
		    abuse.  ARF was extended by
		    <xref target="AUTHFAILURE-REPORT"/> to
		    enable the reporting of email authentication failures.
		    These specifications provided for the source IP address
		    to be included in a report.  As explained in
		    <xref target="LOG"/>, the deployment of IP address
		    sharing techniques requires the source port values to be
		    included in reports if unambiguous identification of the
		    origin of abuse is to be achieved. </t>

		<t> This document defines an ARF reporting field
		    to contain this information and provides guidance for
		    its use. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="keywords" title="Keywords">
		<t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
		    "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
		    "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
		    document are to be interpreted as described in
		    <xref target="KEYWORDS"/>. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="field" title="Source-Port Field Definition">
		<t> A new ARF header field called "Source-Port" is defined.
		    When present in a report, it MUST contain the client
		    port of the TCP connection from which the reported
		    message originated, corresponding to the "Source-IP" field
		    that contains the client address of that same connection,
		    thereby describing completely the origin of
		    the abuse incident. </t>

		<t> Per, <xref target="ABNF"/>, the formal syntax is:

			<figure><artwork>
  source-port = "Source-Port:" [CFWS] 1*5DIGIT [CFWS] CRLF
			</artwork></figure> </t>

		<t> "CFWS", which represents email-style comments or folding
		    white space, is imported from <xref target="MAIL"/>. </t>

		<t> When any report is generated that includes the "Source-IP"
		    field (see Section 3.2 of <xref target="ARF"/>),
		    this field SHOULD also be present, unless the port number
		    is unavailable. </t>

		<t> Use of this field is RECOMMENDED for reports generated per
		    <xref target="AUTHFAILURE-REPORT"/> (see Section 3.1 of
		    that document). </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="clocks" title="Time Accuracy">
		<t> <xref target="LOG"/> underscores the importance of
		    accurate clocks when generating reports that include
		    source port information because of the fact that source
		    ports can be recycled very quickly in Internet Service
		    Provider environments.  The same considerations
		    described there apply here. </t>

		<t> Report generators that include an Arrival-Date report
		    field MAY choose to express the value of that date in
		    Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) to enable simpler
		    correlation with local records at sites that are following
		    the provisions of <xref target="LOG"/>. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
		<t> IANA has added the following entry to the
		    "Feedback Report Header Fields" registry:

		    <list style="hanging">
			<t hangText="Field Name:"> Source-Port </t>

			<t hangText="Description:"> TCP source port
				from which the original message was
				received </t>

			<t hangText="Multiple Appearances:"> No </t>

			<t hangText="Related &quot;Feedback-Type&quot;:"> any </t>

			<t hangText="Reference:"> [RFC6692] </t>
			
			<t hangText="Status:"> current </t>
		    </list> </t>

	<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
		<t> This extension introduces no new security considerations
		    not already covered in <xref target="ARF"/>. </t>

		<t> Some security considerations related to the general
		    topic of source port logging can be found in
		    <xref target="LOG"/>. </t>

<abstract>
<t>Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax.  Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
   capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
   interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
   should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

<list>
<t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119.
</t></list></t>
<t>
   Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement
   level of the document in which they are used.
