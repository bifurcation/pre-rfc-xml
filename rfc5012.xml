<abstract>

<t>This document defines terminology and enumerates requirements for the
context resolution of emergency calls placed by the public using
voice-over-IP (VoIP) and general Internet multimedia systems, where
Internet protocols are used end to end.</t>

</abstract>

</front>
<middle>

<section title="Introduction">

<t>Users of both voice-centric (telephone-like) and non-voice services,
such as text communication for hearing-disabled users (see <xref
  target="RFC3351"/> and <xref target="toip"/>), expect to be able to initiate a
request for help in case of an emergency.</t>

<t>Unfortunately, the existing mechanisms to support emergency calls that have
evolved within the public circuit-switched telephone network (PSTN) are not
appropriate to handle evolving IP-based voice, text, and real-time multimedia
communications.  This document outlines the key requirements that IP-based end
systems and network elements, such as <xref target="RFC3261">Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP)</xref> proxies, need to satisfy in order to provide emergency
call services, which at a minimum, offer the same functionality as existing
PSTN services, with the additional overall goal of making emergency calling
more robust, less costly to implement, and multimedia-capable.</t>

<t>This document only focuses on end-to-end IP-based calls, i.e., 
where the emergency call originates from an IP end system and 
terminates in an IP-capable public safety answering point (PSAP), conveyed entirely over an IP 
network.</t>

<t>We first define terminology in <xref target="terminology"/>.  The
document then outlines various functional issues that relate to placing
an IP-based emergency call, including a description of baseline
requirements (<xref target="base_requirements"/>), identification of the
emergency caller's location (<xref target="location"/>), use of a
service identifier to declare a call to be an emergency call (<xref
target="identifier"/>), and finally, the mapping function required to
route the call to the appropriate PSAP (<xref target="mapping"/>).</t>

<t>The primary purpose of the mapping protocol is to produce a PSAP URI
drawn from a preferred set of URI schemes such as SIP or SIPS URIs,
based on both location information <xref target="RFC4119"></xref> and a
service identifier in order to facilitate the IP end-to-end completion
of an emergency call.</t>

<t>Aside from obtaining a PSAP URI, the mapping protocol is useful for
obtaining other information as well.  There may be a case, for example,
where an appropriate emergency number is not known, only the location.  The
mapping protocol can then return a geographically appropriate emergency
number based on the input.</t>

<?rfc needLines="10" ?>

<t>Since some PSAPs may not immediately support IP, or because some 
user equipment (UE) may not initially support emergency service identifiers, it 
may be necessary to also support emergency service identifiers that 
utilize less-preferred URI schemes, such as a tel URI in order to 
complete an emergency call via the PSTN.</t>

<t>Identification of the caller, while not incompatible with the
requirements for messaging outlined within this document, is considered
to be outside the scope of this document.</t>

<t>Location is required for two separate purposes: first, to support the 
routing of the emergency call to the appropriate PSAP and second, to 
display the caller's location to the call taker to help in dispatching 
emergency assistance to the appropriate location.</t>

<t>This latter use, the display of location information to the PSAP, is 
orthogonal to the mapping protocol, and is outside the scope of this 
document.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="req_terminology" title="Requirements Terminology">

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
<xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>, with the important qualification  
that, unless otherwise stated, these terms apply to the design of the 
mapping protocol, not its implementation or application.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

<section title="Emergency Services">

<t><list style="hanging">

<t hangText="Basic emergency service:"> Basic emergency service 
allows a caller to reach a PSAP serving its current location, but the PSAP 
may not be able to determine the identity or geographic location of the 
caller, except by the call taker asking the caller.</t>

<t hangText="Enhanced emergency service:"> In enhanced emergency
service, the PSAP call taker can determine the caller's current
location.</t>

</list></t>

</section>

<section title="Service Providers">

<t><list style="hanging">

<t hangText="Internet Access Provider (IAP):"> An organization that
provides physical and data link (layer 2) network connectivity to its
customers or users, e.g., through digital subscriber lines, cable TV
plants, Ethernet, leased lines, or radio frequencies.  Examples of such
organizations include telecommunication carriers,
<?rfc needLines="10" ?>
municipal utilities, larger enterprises with their own network infrastructure, and government
organizations, such as the military.</t>

<t hangText="Internet Service Provider (ISP):"> An organization that
provides IP network-layer services to its customers or users.  This
entity may or may not provide the physical-layer and data link (layer-2)
connectivity, such as fiber or Ethernet, i.e., it may or may not play
the role of an IAP.</t>

<t hangText="Application Service Provider (ASP):"> The organization or 
entity that provides application-layer services, which may include voice 
(see "Voice Service Provider").  This entity can be a private 
individual, an enterprise, a government, or a service provider.  An ASP 
is more general than a Voice Service Provider, since emergency calls 
may use other media beyond voice, including text and video.  For a 
particular user, the ASP may or may not be the same organization as his 
IAP or ISP.</t>

<t hangText="Voice Service Provider (VSP):"> A specific type of 
Application Service Provider that provides voice related services 
based on IP, such as call routing, a SIP URI, or PSTN termination.  In this 
document, unless noted otherwise, any reference to "Voice Service 
Provider" or "VSP" may be used interchangeably with "Application/Voice 
Service Provider" or "ASP/VSP".</t>

</list></t>
</section>

<section title="Actors">

<t><list style="hanging">
<t hangText="(Emergency) caller:"> The term "caller" or "emergency 
caller" refers to the person placing an emergency call or sending an 
emergency instant message (IM).</t>

<t hangText="User Equipment (UE):"> User equipment is the device or
software operated by the caller to place an emergency call. A SIP user
agent (UA) is an example of user equipment.</t>

<t hangText="Call taker:"> A call taker is an agent at the PSAP that 
accepts calls and may dispatch emergency help.  Sometimes the 
functions of call taking and dispatching are handled by different groups 
of people, but these divisions of labor are not generally visible to the 
caller and thus do not concern us here.</t>

</list></t>
</section>
<?rfc needLines="10" ?>
<section title="Call Routing Entities">

<t><list style="hanging">

<t hangText="Emergency Service Routing Proxy (ESRP):"> An ESRP 
is an emergency call routing support entity that invokes the 
location-to-PSAP URI mapping function, to return an appropriate PSAP 
URI, or the URI for another ESRP.  Client mapping requests could also 
be performed by a number of entities, including entities that instantiate 
the SIP proxy role and the SIP user agent client role.</t>

<t hangText="Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP):"> A PSAP is a facility where emergency calls are received under the responsibility of a public
authority.  (This terminology is used by both the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), in ETSI SR 002 180,
and the National Emergency Number Association (NENA).)  In the United Kingdom, PSAPs are called Operator Assistance
Centres; in New Zealand, Communications Centres.  Within this document,
it is assumed, unless stated otherwise, that PSAPs support the receipt
of emergency calls over IP, using appropriate application layer
protocols, such as SIP for call signaling and RTP for media.</t>

</list></t>

</section>

<section title="Location">

<t><list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Location:"> A geographic identification assigned to a 
region or feature based on a specific coordinate system, or by other 
precise information such as a street number and name. It can be 
either a civic or geographic location.</t>

<t hangText="Civic location:"> A described location based on some reference
system, such as jurisdictional region or postal delivery grid.  A street
address is a common example of a civic location.</t>

<t hangText="Geographic location:"> A reference to a point that is able
to be located, as described by a set of defined coordinates within a
geographic coordinate system, such as latitude and longitude within the
WGS-84 datum.  For example, a 2-D geographic location is defined as an
(x,y) coordinate value pair according to the distance north or south of
the equator and east or west of the prime meridian.</t>

<t hangText="Location validation:"> A caller location is considered
valid if the civic or geographic location is recognizable within an
acceptable location reference system (e.g., United States Postal Address
or the WGS-84 datum) and can be mapped to one or more PSAPs.  While it
is desirable to determine that a location exists, validation may not
ensure that such a location exists, but rather may only
<?rfc needLines="10" ?>
ensure that the location falls within some range of known values.  Location validation
ensures that a location is able to be referenced for mapping, but makes
no assumption about the association between the caller and the caller's
location.</t>

</list></t>
</section>

<section title="Identifiers, Numbers, and Dial Strings">

<t><list style="hanging">

<t hangText="(Emergency) service number:"> The (emergency) service number is a
string of digits used to reach the (emergency) service.  The emergency service
number is often just called the emergency number.  It is the number typically
dialed on devices directly connected to the PSTN and the number reserved for
emergency calls by national or regional numbering authorities.  It only
contains the digits 0 through 9, #, and *.  The service number may
depend on the location of the caller.  For example, the general emergency service number in
the United States is 911 and the poison control service number is
18002221222. In most cases, the service number and dial string are the same; they
may differ in some private phone networks.  A service number may be carried in <xref
target="RFC3966">tel URLs</xref>, along with a context identifier.  In the
North American numbering plan, some service numbers are three-digit N11 or service codes, but not all emergency numbers have
three digits. A caller may have to dial a service dial string (below) that differs from the
service number when using a PBX.</t>

<t hangText="(Emergency) service dial string:"> The service dial string
identifies the string of digits that a caller must dial to reach a particular
(emergency) service.  In devices directly connected to the PSTN, the service
dial string is the same as the service number and may thus depend on the
location of the caller.  However, in private phone networks, such as in PBXs,
the service dial string consists of a dialing prefix to reach an outside line,
followed by the emergency number.  For example, in a hotel, the dial string for
emergency services in the United States might be 9911.  Dial strings may
contain indications of pauses or wait-for-secondary-dial-tone indications.
Service dial strings are outside the scope of this document.</t>

<t hangText="(Emergency) service identifier:"> The (emergency) service
identifier describes the emergency service, independent of the user
interface mechanism, the signaling protocol that is used to reach the
service, or the caller's geographic location.  It is a protocol constant
and used within the mapping and signaling protocols.  An example is the
<xref target="service-urn">service URN</xref>.</t>

<t hangText="(Emergency) service URL:"> The service URL is a
protocol-specific (e.g., SIP) or protocol-agnostic (e.g., <xref
target="RFC3860">im:</xref>) identifier that contains the address 
of the PSAP or other emergency service.  It depends on the specific 
signaling or data transport protocol used to reach the emergency 
service.</t>

<t hangText="Service URN:"> A service URN is an implementation of a
service identifier, which can be applied to both emergency and
non-emergency contexts, e.g., urn:service:sos or urn:service:counseling. 
Within this document, service URNs are referred to as 'emergency service
URNs' <xref target="service-urn"></xref>.</t>

<t hangText="Home emergency number:"> A home emergency number is the
emergency number valid at the caller's customary home location, e.g.,
his permanent residence.  The home location may or may not coincide with
the service area of the caller's VSP.</t>

<t hangText="Home emergency dial string:"> A home dial string is the
dial string valid at the caller's customary home location, e.g.,
his permanent residence.</t>

<t hangText="Visited emergency number:"> A visited emergency number is
the emergency number valid at the caller's current physical location. 
We distinguish the visited emergency number if the caller is traveling
outside his home region.</t>

<t hangText="Visited emergency dial string:"> A visited emergency dial string is
the dial string number valid at the caller's current physical location. </t>

</list></t>
</section>

<section title="Mapping">

<t><list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Mapping:"> Mapping is the process of resolving a location
to one or more PSAP URIs that directly identify a PSAP, or point to an
intermediary that knows about a PSAP and that is designated as
responsible for serving that location.</t>

<t hangText="Mapping client:"> A mapping client interacts with the 
mapping server to learn one or more PSAP URIs for a given location.</t>

<t hangText="Mapping protocol:"> A protocol used to convey the 
mapping request and response.</t>

<t hangText="Mapping server:"> The mapping server holds information 
about the location-to-PSAP URI mapping.</t>

<t hangText="Mapping service:"> A network service that uses a 
distributed mapping protocol to perform a mapping between a location 
and a PSAP, or intermediary that knows about the PSAP, and is used 
to assist in routing an emergency call.</t>

</figure>
</t>

<t><xref target="framework"/> shows the interaction between the entities
involved in the call.  There are a number of different deployment
choices, as can be easily seen from the figure.</t>

<t>Is the Internet Access Provider also the Application/Voice
Service Provider?  In the Internet today, the roles of Internet access
provider and application/voice service provider are typically provided
by different entities.  As a consequence, the Application/Voice
Service Provider is typically not able to directly determine the
physical location of the emergency caller.</t>

<t>The overlapping squares in the figure indicate that some functions
can be collapsed into a single entity.  As an example, the
Application/Voice Service Provider might be the same entity as the
Internet Access Provider.  There is, however, no requirement that
this must be the case.  Additionally, we consider that end systems might
act as their own ASP/VSP, e.g., either for enterprises or for
residential users.</t>

<t>Various potential interactions between the entities depicted in <xref
target="framework"/> are described below:</t>

<t><list style='numbers'>

<t>Location information might be available to the end host itself.</t>

<t>Location information might, however, also be obtained from the
Internet Access Provider.</t>

<t>The emergency caller might need to consult a mapping service 
to determine the PSAP (or other relevant information) that is appropriate 
for the physical location of the emergency caller, possibly considering 
other attributes, such as appropriate language support by the emergency 
call taker.</t>

<t>The emergency caller might get assistance for emergency call
routing by infrastructure elements that are emergency call routing
support entities, such as an Emergency Service Routing Proxy (ESRP) in
SIP.</t>

<t>Location information is used by emergency call routing support 
entities for subsequent mapping requests.</t>

<t>Emergency call routing support entities might need to consult a 
mapping service to determine where to route the emergency call.</t>

<t>For infrastructure-based emergency call routing (in contrast to
UE-based emergency call routing), the emergency call routing support
entity needs to forward the call to the PSAP.</t>

<t>The emergency caller may interact directly with the PSAP, where the
UE invokes mapping, and initiates a connection, without relying on any
intermediary emergency call routing support entities.</t>

</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="base_requirements" title="High-Level Requirements">

<t>Below, we summarize high-level architectural requirements that 
guide some of the component requirements detailed later in the 
document.</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Re1.  Application/Voice service provider existence:"> The 
initiation of an IP-based emergency call SHOULD NOT assume the 
existence of an Application/Voice Service Provider (ASP/VSP).</t>

<t>Motivation:  The caller may not have an application/voice service 
provider. For example, a residence may have its own DNS domain and 
run its own SIP proxy server for that domain.  On a larger scale, a 
university might provide voice services to its students and staff, but 
might not be a telecommunication provider.</t>

<t hangText="Re2.  International applicability:"> Regional, political, and 
organizational aspects MUST be considered during the design of 
protocols and protocol extensions that support IP-based emergency 
calls.</t>

<t>Motivation: It must be possible for a device or software developed or
purchased in one country to place emergency calls in another country.  System
components should not be biased towards a particular set of emergency numbers
or languages. Also, different countries have evolved different ways of
organizing emergency services, e.g., either centralizing them or
having smaller regional subdivisions, such as the United States or 
municipalities, handle emergency calls within their jurisdiction.</t>

<t hangText="Re3.  Distributed administration:"> Deployment of 
IP-based emergency services MUST NOT depend on a single central 
administrative authority.</t>

<t>Motivation: The design of the mapping protocol must make it 
possible to deploy and administer emergency calling features on a 
regional or national basis without requiring coordination with other 
regions or nations.  The system cannot assume, for example, that 
there is a single global entity issuing certificates for PSAPs, ASP/VSPs, 
IAPs, or other participants.</t>

<t hangText="Re4.  Multi-mode communication:"> IP-based emergency 
calls MUST support multiple communication modes, including, for example, 
audio, video, and text.</t>
<?rfc needLines="10" ?>
<t>Motivation: Within the PSTN, voice and text telephony (often called 
TTY or text-phone in North America) are the only commonly supported 
media.  Emergency calling must support a variety of media. Such media 
should include voice, conversational text 
(<xref target="RFC4103">RFC 4103</xref>), instant messaging, and 
video.</t>

<t hangText="Re5.  Mapping result usability:"> The mapping protocol 
MUST return one or more URIs that are usable within a standard 
signaling protocol (i.e., without special emergency extensions).</t>

<t>Motivation:  For example, a SIP URI that is returned by the mapping
protocol needs to be usable by any SIP-capable phone within a SIP-initiated emergency call.  This is in contrast to a "special purpose"
URI, which may not be recognizable by a legacy SIP device.</t>

<t hangText="Re6.  PSAP URI accessibility:"> The mapping protocol 
MUST support interaction between the client and server where no 
enrollment to a mapping service exists or is required.</t>

<t>Motivation: The mapping server may well be operated by a service 
provider, but access to the server offering the mapping must not 
require use of a specific ISP or ASP/VSP.</t>

<t hangText="Re7.  Common data structures and formats:"> The mapping
protocol SHOULD support common formats (e.g., PIDF-LO) for location data.</t>

<t>Motivation:  Location databases should not need to be transformed or 
modified in any unusual or unreasonable way in order for the mapping 
protocol to use the data.  For example, a database that contains civic 
addresses used by location servers may be used for multiple 
purposes and applications beyond emergency service location-to-PSAP 
URI mapping.</t>

<t hangText="Re8.  Anonymous mapping:"> The mapping protocol 
MUST NOT require the true identity of the target for which the location 
information is attributed.</t>

<t>Motivation: Ideally, no identity information is provided via the mapping 
protocol.  Where identity information is provided, it may be in the form of 
an unlinked pseudonym (<xref target="RFC3693">RFC 3693</xref>).</t>

<section anchor="location" title="Identifying the Caller's Location">

<t>Location can either be provided directly (by value), or via a pointer
(by reference), and represents either a civic location, or a geographic
location.  An important question is how and when to attach location
information to the VoIP emergency signaling messages.  In general, we
can distinguish three modes of operation of how a location is associated
with an emergency call:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">

<t hangText="UA-inserted:"> The caller's user agent inserts the location
information into the call-signaling message.</t>

<t hangText="UA-referenced:"> The caller's user agent provides a pointer
(i.e., a location reference), via a permanent or temporary identifier,
to the location information, which is stored by a location server
somewhere else and then retrieved by the PSAP, ESRP, or other authorized
entity.</t>

<t hangText="Proxy-inserted:"> A proxy along the call path inserts the 
location or location reference.</t>

</list></t>

<t>The following requirements apply:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">

<t hangText="Lo1.  Reference datum:"> The mapping protocol MUST 
support the WGS-84 coordinate reference system and MAY support 
other coordinate reference systems.</t>

<t>Motivation:  Though many different datums exist around the world,
this document recommends the WGS-84 datum since it is designed to
describe the whole earth, rather than a single continent or other
region, and is commonly used to represent Global Positioning System
coordinates.</t>

<t hangText="Lo2.  Location delivery by-value:"> The mapping 
protocol MUST support the delivery of location information using a 
by-value method, though it MAY also support de-referencing a URL 
that references a location object.</t>

<t>Motivation:  The mapping protocol is not required to support the ability 
to de-reference specific location references.</t>

<t hangText="Lo3.  Alternate community names:"> The mapping protocol
MUST support both the jurisdictional community name and the postal
community name fields within the <xref target="RFC4119">PIDF-LO</xref>
data.</t>

<t>Motivation:  The mapping protocol must accept queries with either a postal
or jurisdictional community name field, or both, and provide appropriate
responses.  If a mapping query contains only one community name and the
database contains both jurisdictional and postal community names, the mapping
protocol response SHOULD return both community names.</t>

<t hangText="Lo4.  Validation of civic location:"> The mapping protocol
MUST be able to report the results of validating civic locations (street
addresses).</t>

<t>Motivation:  Location validation provides an opportunity to help
ascertain ahead of time whether or not a successful mapping to the
appropriate PSAP will likely occur when it is required.  Validation may
also help to avoid delays during emergency call setup due to invalid
location data.</t>

<t hangText="Lo5.  Information about location data used for mapping:"> 
The mapping protocol MUST support the ability to provide ancillary 
information about the resolution of location data used to retrieve a PSAP 
URI.</t>

<t>Motivation: The mapping server may not use all the data elements in 
the provided location information to determine a match, or may be able to 
find a match based on all of the information except for some specific 
data elements.  The uniqueness of this information set may be used to 
differentiate among emergency jurisdictions.  Precision or resolution in 
the context of this requirement might mean, for example, explicit 
identification of the data elements that were used successfully in the 
mapping.</t>

<t hangText="Lo6.  Contact for location problems:"> The 
mapping protocol MUST support a mechanism to contact an appropriate
authority to resolve mapping-related issues for the queried location.
For example, the querier may want to report problems with the response values
or indicate that the mapping database is mistaken on declaring a civic
location as non-existent.</t>

<t>Motivation:  Initially, authorities may provide URLs where a human
user can report problems with an address or location.  In addition, web
services may be defined to automate such reporting.  For example, the
querier may wish to report that the mapping database may be missing a
newly built or renamed street or house number.</t>

<t hangText="Lo7.  Limits to validation:"> Successful validation of a 
civic location MUST NOT be required to place an emergency call.</t>

<t>Motivation: In some cases, a civic location may not be considered 
valid.  This fact should not result in the call being dropped or rejected by 
any entity along the call setup signaling path to the PSAP.</t>

<t hangText="Lo8.  3D sensitive mapping:"> The mapping protocol MUST 
implement support for both 2D and 3D location information, and MAY 
accept either a 2D or 3D mapping request as input.</t>

<t>Motivation:  It is expected that queriers may provide either 2D or 3D
data.  When a 3D request is presented within an area only defined by 2D
data within the mapping server, the mapping result would be the same as
if the height or altitude coordinate had been omitted from the
mapping request.</t>

<t hangText="Lo9.  Database type indicator:"> The mapping protocol MAY 
support a mechanism that provides an indication describing a specific 
type of location database used.</t>

<t>Motivation: It is useful to know the source of the data stored in the 
database used for location validation, either for civic or 
geographic location matching. In the United States, sources of data
could include the United States Postal Service, the Master Street Address
Guide (MSAG), or commercial map data providers.</t>

</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="identifier" title="Emergency Service Identifier">

<t>Emergency service identifiers are protocol constants that allow
protocol entities, such as SIP proxy servers, to distinguish emergency
calls from non-emergency calls and to identify the specific emergency
service desired.  Emergency service identifiers are a subclass of
service identifiers that more generally identify services reachable by
callers.  An example of a service identifier is the service URN <xref
target="service-urn"></xref>, but other identifiers, such
as <xref target="RFC3966">tel URIs</xref>, may also serve this role during
a transition period.</t>

<t>Since this document only addresses emergency services, we use the
terms "emergency service identifier" and "service identifier"
interchangeably.  Requirements for these identifiers include:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Id1.  Multiple emergency services:"> The mapping protocol
MUST be able to support different emergency services distinguished by different service identifiers.</t>

<t>Motivation: Some jurisdictions may offer multiple types of emergency
services that operate independently and can be contacted directly; for
example, fire, police, and ambulance services.</t>

<t hangText="Id2.  Extensible emergency service identifiers:"> The
mapping protocol MUST support an extensible list of emergency
identifiers, though it is not required to provide mappings for every
possible service.</t>

<t>Motivation:  Extensibility is required since new emergency services may be
introduced over time, either globally or in some jurisdictions.  The
availability of emergency services depends on the locations.  For example, the
Netherlands are unlikely to offer a mountain rescue service.</t> 

<t hangText="Id3.  Discovery of emergency number:"> The mapping protocol
MUST be able to return the location-dependent emergency number for the
location indicated in the query.</t>

<t>Motivation:  Users are trained to dial the appropriate emergency
number to reach emergency services.  There needs to be a way to figure
out the emergency number at the current location of the caller.</t>

<t hangText="Id4.  Home emergency number recognition:"> User equipment MUST
be able to translate a home emergency number into an emergency service
identifier.</t>

<t>Motivation:  The UE could be pre-provisioned with the appropriate
information in order to perform such a translation or could discover the
emergency number by querying the mapping protocol with its home
location.</t>

<t hangText="Id5.  Emergency number replacement:"> There SHOULD be support for
replacement of the emergency number with the appropriate emergency service
identifier for each signaling protocol used for an emergency call, based on
local conventions, regulations, or preference (e.g., as in the case of an
enterprise).</t>

<t>Motivation: Any signaling protocol requires the use of some identifier 
to indicate the called party, and the user equipment may lack the capability 
to determine the actual service URL (PSAP URI).  The use of local 
conventions may be required as a transition mechanism.  Since relying on
recognizing local numbering conventions makes it difficult for devices
to be used outside their home context and for external devices to be
introduced into a network, protocols should use standardized emergency service
identifiers.</t>

<t hangText="Id6.  Emergency service identifier marking:"> Signaling
protocols MUST support emergency service identifiers to mark a call as
an emergency call.</t>

<t>Motivation: Marking ensures proper handling as an emergency call 
by downstream elements that may not recognize, for example, a
<?rfc needLines="10" ?>
local variant of a logical emergency address.  This marking 
mechanism is related to, but independent of, marking calls for
<xref target="RFC4412">prioritized call handling</xref>.</t>

<t hangText="Id7.  Handling unrecognized emergency service
identifiers:"> There MUST be support for calls that are initiated as
emergency calls even if the specific emergency service requested is not
recognized by the ESRP.  Such calls will then be routed to a generic
emergency service.</t>

<t>Motivation:  Fallback routing allows new emergency services to be introduced
incrementally, while avoiding non-routable emergency calls.  For example, a
call for marine rescue services would be routed to a general PSAP if the
caller's location does not offer marine rescue services yet.</t>

<t hangText="Id8. Return fallback service identifier:"> The mapping
protocol MUST be able to report back the actual service mapped if the
mapping protocol substitutes another service for the one requested.</t>

<t>Motivation: A mapping server may be configured to automatically
look up the PSAP for another service if the user-requested service is
not available for that location. For example, if there is no marine
rescue service, the mapping protocol might return the PSAP URL for
general emergencies and include the "urn:service.sos" identifier in the
response to alert the querier to that fact.</t>

<t hangText="Id9.  Discovery of visited emergency numbers:"> The mapping protocol MUST support a mechanism to allow the end device to learn visited emergency numbers.</t>

<t>Motivation: Travelers visiting a foreign country may observe the
local emergency number, e.g., seeing it painted on the side of a fire
truck, and then rightfully expect to be able to dial that emergency
number. Similarly, a local "good Samaritan" may use a tourist's cell phone to
summon help.</t>

</list></t>
</section>

<section anchor="mapping" title="Mapping Protocol">

<t>There are two basic approaches to invoke the mapping protocol.  We
refer to these as caller-based and mediated.  In each case, the mapping
client initiates a request to a mapping server via a mapping protocol. 
A proposed mapping protocol, LoST, is outlined in <xref
target="lost"/>.</t>

<t>For caller-based resolution, the caller's user agent invokes the 
mapping protocol to determine the appropriate PSAP based on the 
location provided.  The resolution may take place well before the 
actual emergency call is placed, or at the time of the call.</t>

<t>For mediated resolution, an emergency call routing support entity, 
such as a SIP (outbound) proxy or redirect server, invokes the 
mapping service.</t>

<t>Since servers may be used as outbound proxy servers by 
clients that are not in the same geographic area as the proxy server, 
any proxy server has to be able to translate any caller location to the 
appropriate PSAP.  (A traveler may, for example, accidentally or 
intentionally configure its home proxy server as its outbound proxy 
server, even while far away from home.)</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Ma1.  Baseline query protocol:"> A 
mandatory-to-implement protocol MUST be specified.</t>

<t>Motivation: An over-abundance of similarly capable choices appears 
undesirable for interoperability.</t>

<t hangText="Ma2. Extensible protocol:"> The mapping protocol MUST 
be designed to support the extensibility of location data elements, both 
for new and existing fields.</t>

<t>Motivation: This is needed, for example, to accommodate future 
extensions-to-location information that might be included in the 
PIDF-LO (<xref target="RFC4119"></xref>).</t>

<t hangText="Ma3.  Incrementally deployable:"> The mapping protocol MUST
be designed to support its incremental deployment.</t>

<t>Motivation: It must not be necessary, for example, to have a global 
street level database before deploying the system.  It is acceptable to 
have some misrouting of calls when the database does not (yet) contain 
accurate PSAP service area information.</t>

<t hangText="Ma4.  Any time mapping:"> The mapping protocol MUST 
support the ability of the mapping function to be invoked at any time, 
including while an emergency call is in process and before an emergency 
call is initiated.</t>

<t>Motivation: If the mapping query fails at call time, it may be
advantageous to be able to fall back to the result of an earlier
mapping query.  This prior knowledge would be obtained by 
performing a mapping query at any time prior to an emergency call.</t>
<?rfc needLines="10" ?>
<t hangText="Ma5. Anywhere mapping:"> The mapping protocol MUST 
support the ability to provide mapping information in response to an 
individual query from any (earthly) location, regardless of where the 
mapping client is located, either geographically or by network location.
</t>

<t>Motivation: The mapping client, such as an ESRP, may not 
necessarily be anywhere close to the caller or the appropriate PSAP, 
but must still be able to obtain mapping information.</t>

<t hangText="Ma6.  Appropriate PSAP:"> The mapping protocol 
MUST support the routing of an emergency call to the PSAP responsible 
for a particular geographic area.</t>

<t>Motivation: Routing to the wrong PSAP will result in delays in 
handling emergencies as calls are redirected, and therefore will 
also result in inefficient use of PSAP resources at the initial point of 
contact.  It is important that the location determination mechanism not 
be fooled by the location of IP telephony gateways or dial-in lines into 
a corporate LAN (and dispatch emergency help to the gateway or 
campus, rather than the caller), multi-site LANs and similar 
arrangements.</t>

<t hangText="Ma7.  Multiple PSAP URIs:"> The mapping protocol MUST 
support a method to return multiple PSAP URIs, which cover the same 
geographic area.</t>

<t>Motivation:  Different contact protocols (e.g., PSTN via tel URIs and
IP via SIP URIs) may be routed to different PSAPs. Less likely, two PSAPs
may overlap in their coverage region.</t>

<t hangText="Ma8.  Single primary URI per contact protocol:"> Though the
mapping protocol may be able to include multiple URIs in the response, it
SHOULD return only one primary URI per contact protocol used, so that clients
are not required to select among different targets for the same contact
protocol.</t>

<t>Motivation:  There may be two or more URIs returned when multiple 
contact protocols are available (e.g., SIP and SMS).  The client may 
select among multiple contact protocols based on its capabilities, 
preference settings, or availability.</t>
<?rfc needLines="8" ?>
<t hangText="Ma9.  Non-preferred URI schemes:"> The mapping protocol MAY
support the return of a less-preferred URI scheme,  such as a tel URI.</t>

<t>Motivation:   In order to provide incremental support to non-IP 
PSAPs, it may be necessary to be able to complete an emergency 
call via the PSTN.</t>

<t hangText="Ma10.  URI properties:"> The mapping protocol MUST 
support the ability to provide ancillary information about a contact 
that allows the mapping client to determine relevant properties of the 
PSAP URI.</t>

<t>Motivation:  In some cases, the same geographic area is served by
several PSAPs; for example, a corporate campus might be served by both a
corporate security department and the municipal PSAP.  The mapping
protocol should then return URIs for both, with information allowing the
querying entity to choose one or the other.  This determination could be
made by either an ESRP, based on local policy, or by direct user choice,
in the case of caller-based methods.</t>

<t hangText="Ma11.  Mapping referral:"> The mapping protocol MUST 
support a mechanism for the mapping client to contact any mapping 
server and be referred to another mapping server that is more qualified 
to answer the query.</t>

<t>Motivation:  Referrals help mitigate the impact of incorrect
configuration that directs a client to the wrong initial mapping
server.</t>

<t hangText="Ma12.  Split responsibility:"> The mapping protocol MUST 
support the division of data subset handling between multiple mapping 
servers within a single level of a civic location hierarchy.</t>

<t>Motivation: For example, two mapping servers for the same city or 
county may handle different streets within that city or county.</t>

<t hangText="Ma13.  URL for error reporting:"> The mapping protocol 
MUST support the ability to return a URL that can be used to report a 
suspected or known error within the mapping database.</t>

<t>Motivation: If an error is returned, for example, there needs to be a 
URL that points to a resource that can explain or potentially help 
resolve the error.</t>

<t hangText="Ma14.  Resilience to mapping server failure:"> The mapping 
protocol MUST support a mechanism that enables the client to fail over 
to different (replica) mapping server.</t>

<t>Motivation:  The failure of a mapping server should not preclude the
mapping client from receiving an answer to its query.</t>

<t hangText="Ma15.  Traceable resolution:"> The mapping protocol 
SHOULD support the ability of the mapping client to be able to determine 
the entity or entities that provided the emergency address resolution 
information.</t>

<t>Motivation:  To improve reliability and performance, it is important
to be able to trace which servers contributed to the resolution of a
query.</t>

<t hangText="Ma16.  Minimal additional delay:"> Mapping protocol 
execution SHOULD minimize the amount of delay within the overall 
call-setup time.</t>

<t>Motivation:  Since outbound proxies will likely be asked to 
resolve the same geographic coordinates repeatedly, a suitable 
time-limited caching mechanism should be supported.</t>

<t hangText="Ma17.  Freshness indication:"> The mapping protocol SHOULD
support an indicator describing how current the information provided by
the mapping source is.</t>

<t>Motivation: This is especially useful when an alternate mapping is 
requested, and alternative sources of mapping data may not have 
been created or updated with the same set of information or within 
the same time frame.  Differences in currency between mapping data 
contained within mapping sources should be minimized.</t>
