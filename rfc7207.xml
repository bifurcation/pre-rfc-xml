<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<!-- [authors]
  As stated in our response message, we prefer to keep
  the original, explicit introduction of the acronym "ECB".
  The incidental equality of the reference anchor to the acronym
  does not mean that the introduction of the acronym should be dropped.
  The 2nd line in the paragraph below has been changed accordingly.
-->
  <t>
    The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) is composed of
    the European Central Bank (ECB) <xref target="ECB" />
    and the national central banks (NCBs)
    of all 27 EU Member States (Article 107.01 of the Treaty) --
    whether they have adopted the Euro currency or not.
    One central bank belonging to the ESCB is Deutsche Bundesbank
    <xref target="DBBK" />, which, for the purpose of this document,
    is acting on behalf of the ESCB.
    The term Eurosystem is used to refer to the entity composed of the ECB
    and the NCBs of those member states that have adopted the Euro currency.
    For further information on the tasks of the ESCB and the Eurosystem,
    please refer to the ECB web site
    (<xref target="ECB" />, <xref target="ESCB" />,
    <xref target="Eurosystem" />).
  </t>

  <t>
    The ESCB provides the TARGET2
    (Trans-European Automated Realtime Gross Settlement Express Transfer)
    system for market infrastructure; it is an interbank payment system
    for the real-time processing
    of cross-border transfers throughout the European Union.
    In addition, the ESCB is currently implementing TARGET2-Securities,
    a future securities settlement platform that offers a new, harmonized
    and centralized method of settling securities in central bank money.
    The TARGET2-Securities project was initiated by the Eurosystem as
    platform owner in 2006. TARGET2-Securities is currently under development.
    Four central banks of the Eurosystem -- Deutsche Bundesbank,
    Banque de France, Banca d'Italia, and Banco de Espana (4CB) -- are
    entrusted with the development and the operation of the platform.
    For details, see <xref target="T2S_ECB" /> and <xref target="T2S_DBBK" />.
  </t>

  <t>
    The future users of TARGET2-Securities will communicate and exchange
    information with the platform via messages
    (a set of structured information) following the ISO 20022 Standard
    <xref target="ISO20022-RA" />.
  </t>

<!-- [rfced] The use of the conjunction "but" seems odd here because
the use for similar purposes does not seem to contrast with the
initial statement. Could "but" be changed to "and"?

Original:
   This document specifies and registers with IANA a URN Namespace for
   the Eurosystem, which will be populated initially by names for
   abstract and concrete entities used in TARGET2-Securities messaging,
   but may be used for similar purposes in the future.

Perhaps:
   This document specifies and registers with IANA a URN Namespace for
   the Eurosystem; it will be populated initially by names for
   abstract and concrete entities used in TARGET2-Securities messaging,
   and it may be used for similar purposes in the future.


[authors]
  As stated in our reponse message, the contrast between
  "initially" and "in the future" in our opinion is strong and
  important, and it justifies the "but".

  So please do not change to the original text in this respect.

  However, you might want to split the sentence in two sentences
  as shown above while keeping the "but" - this change is
  not (yet) applied below.
-->

  <t>
    This document specifies and registers with IANA a URN Namespace
    for the Eurosystem, which will be populated initially by names
    for abstract and concrete entities used in TARGET2-Securities
    messaging, but may be used for similar purposes in the future.
  </t>

</section>

<section anchor="names_cons" title="Namespace Considerations">

  <t>
    The goal of the requested namespace is to ensure the stability and
    uniqueness of the names of various items that are used within the messages
    exchanged between the Eurosystem and the users of TARGET2-Securities
    (or potentially, other future projects of the Eurosystem).
  </t>

  <t>
    It is essential that names of items (such as the XML schema describing the
    message itself) can be used to identify the resource even years after the
    message has been exchanged.
    This context requires a new namespace owned by,
    and under the perpetual control of, the Eurosystem.
  </t>

  <t>
    The messaging context of the needed identifiers necessitates
    the usage of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) as specified in
    <xref target="RFC3986"> Internet STD 66 </xref>.
  </t>

  <t>
    The persistent identifiers needed are protocol-independent resource
    names -- the same resource may exist in multiple physical locations,
    and thus be accessible via multiple URLs, but there's the need for
    a single abstract identifier as a handle (name) for it.
  </t>

  <t>
    Thus, the logical choice for the placement of such a namespace is
    the use of Uniform Resource Names (URNs), as defined by
    <xref target="RFC1737" /> and <xref target="RFC2141" />
    (and its work-in-progress successor),
    by specifying a new URN Namespace <xref target="RFC3406" />
    for the Eurosystem.
  </t>

<!-- [rfced] This document mentions two different "work-in-progress
successor" documents, which seem to be:
 draft-ietf-urnbis-rfc3406bis-urn-ns-reg and
 draft-ietf-urnbis-rfc2141bis-urn

As they are currently Internet-Drafts, they can be added as informative
references. If you would like to add them in order to be more specific
than "work-in-progress successor", please let us know. If so, the
reference entries could appear as follows (for the current versions):

[NS-REG-BIS] Saint-Andre, P., "Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace
             Definition Mechanisms", Work in Progress, February 2014.

[URN-SYNTAX] Saint-Andre, P., Ed., "Uniform Resource Name (URN)
             Syntax", Work in Progress, January 2014.


[authors]
  As detailed in our response message, the matter is
  controversial and far from WG consensus; proper references
  would have to be explicitly to the -03 versions of these drafts
  (by different authors).  There's no harm in the surplus clauses in
  the template, which simply state that these extensions in those
  potential successors to RFC 2141 and RFC 3406  don't apply.

  To avoid adding to the controversy, please keep the text "as is";
  no change applied in the paragraph above.
-->

</section>

<section anchor="community_cons" title="Community Considerations">

  <t>
    The Eurosystem messages carrying the resource names are exchanged in
    IP networks.  Although the mass production use of the assigned URNs
    will be contained in messages carried in cryptographic digital
    envelopes or Virtual Private Networks, the message-related resources
    being persistently named need to be referred to and resolved in the
    public Internet. The transparency requirements (needed for
    establishing and maintaining public trust into the subject financial
    transaction systems), open software development processes, and
    software deployment require the origin and authority for the URNs to
    be easily identified, and the URNs to be resolved on the public
    Internet.  URI references to the Eurosystem resources will be used in
    connection with identifiers drawn from previously standardized Formal
    URN Namespaces allocated to other international treaty organizations,
    and it is mandatory that the authority behind the new URNs be easily
    and clearly identified, and be at a perceived "equivalent" standards
    level, parallel to the existing ones.  Therefore, a mnemonic, Formal
    URN Namespace Identifier is needed for the intended purpose.
  </t>

  <t>
    Thus, this document specifies a "Formal URN Namespace" using the
    procedures laid down in <xref target="RFC3406"> RFC 3406 </xref>
    (and incorporates some of the additional information under discussion
    for its work-in-progress successor into the registration template
    below).
  </t>

  <t>
    The requested URN Namespace Identifier (NID) is 'eurosystem'.

        <vspace blankLines="1" />
        The fragment part of URI references to 'eurosystem' URNs

      </t>

      <t hangText="Identifier uniqueness considerations:">
        <vspace blankLines="1" />
        Identifiers are opaquely assigned by Eurosystem URN Registration
        that guarantees uniqueness.
        This is simply achieved by reliably keeping track of already assigned
        names and comparing all new proposed names to the ones already present
        in the database.
        If the name already has been assigned, a new one has to be proposed.
      </t>

      <t hangText="Identifier persistence considerations:">
        <vspace blankLines="1" />
        Assigned URNs will not be reused and will remain valid
        beyond the lifecycle of the referenced resources.
        However, it should be noted that although the URNs remain valid,
        the status of the referenced resource may change.
      </t>

      <t hangText="Process of identifier assignment:">
        <vspace blankLines="1" />
        Names are granted by Eurosystem URN Registration

        Future changes to the assignment methods may allow others
        to assign sub-spaces of the flat namespace,
        but again, this knowledge is only valid internally and should
        never be inferred or relied upon externally.
      </t>

      <t hangText="Process of identifier resolution:">
        <vspace blankLines="1" />
        Eurosystem URNs are resolved via URN resolvers run under Eurosystem
        responsibility.
        <vspace blankLines="1" />
