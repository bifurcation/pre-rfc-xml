    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a framework and several scenarios for a
      pseudowire (PW) dual-homing local protection mechanism that avoids
      unnecessary switchovers and does not depend on whether a control plane
      is used. A Dual-Node Interconnection (DNI) PW is used to carry traffic between the
      dual-homing Provider Edge (PE) nodes when a failure occurs in one of the Attachment Circuits (AC) or PWs.
      This PW dual-homing local protection mechanism is complementary to existing PW protection mechanisms.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC6372"/> and <xref target="RFC6378"/> describe the
      framework and mechanism of MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) linear protection, which can provide
      protection for the MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) or pseudowire (PW) between the edge nodes.
      This mechanism does not protect against failure of the Attachment Circuit
      (AC) or the Provider Edge (PE) node. <xref target="RFC6718"/> and <xref
      target="RFC6870"/> describe the framework and mechanism for PW
      redundancy to provide protection against AC or PE node failure. The PW
      redundancy mechanism is based on the signaling of the Label Distribution
      Protocol (LDP), which is applicable to PWs with a dynamic control plane.
      <xref target="RFC8104"/> describes a fast
      local repair mechanism for PW egress endpoint failures, which is based
      on PW redundancy, upstream label assignment, and context-specific label
      switching. The mechanism defined in <xref
      target="RFC8104"/> is only applicable to
      PWs with a dynamic control plane.</t>

      <t>There is a need to support a dual-homing local protection mechanism
      that avoids unnecessary switches of the AC or PW and can be used
      regardless of whether a control plane is used. In some scenarios, such as mobile
      backhauling, the MPLS PWs are provisioned with dual-homing topology in
      which at least the Customer Edge (CE) node on one side is dual-homed to two PEs. If some
      fault occurs in the primary AC, operators usually prefer to have the
      switchover only on the dual-homing PE side and keep the working
      pseudowires unchanged if possible. 
This is to avoid massive PW switchover in the mobile backhaul network due to
AC failure in the mobile core site; such massive PW switchover may in turn
lead to congestion caused by migrating traffic away from the preferred paths
of network planners. Similarly, as multiple PWs share the physical AC in the 
mobile core site, it is preferable to keep using the working AC when 
one working PW fails in the Packet Switched Network (PSN) to potentially
avoid unnecessary switchover for other PWs. To meet the above requirements, a fast dual-homing local PW
      protection mechanism is needed to protect against the failures of an AC,
      the PE node, and the PSN.</t>

      <t>This document describes the framework and several typical scenarios
      of PW dual-homing local protection. A Dual-Node Interconnection
      (DNI) PW is used between the dual-homing PE nodes to carry traffic
      when a failure occurs in the AC or PW side. In order
      for the dual-homing PE nodes to determine the forwarding state of AC, PW,
      and DNI-PW, necessary state exchange and coordination between the
      dual-homing PEs is needed. The necessary mechanisms and protocol
      extensions are defined in <xref target="RFC8185"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Reference Models of Dual-Homing Local Protection">
      <t>This section shows the reference architecture of the dual-homing PW
      local protection and the usage of the architecture in different
      scenarios.</t>

      <section title="PE Architecture">
        <t><xref target="figure_1"/> shows the PE architecture for dual-homing local
        protection. This is based on the architecture in Figure 4a of <xref
        target="RFC3985"/>. In addition to the AC and the service PW between
        the local and remote PEs, a DNI-PW is used to connect the forwarders
        of the dual-homing PEs. It can be used to forward traffic between the
        dual-homing PEs when a failure occurs in the AC or service PW side. As
        <xref target="RFC3985"/> specifies: "any required switching
        functionality is the responsibility of a forwarder function". In this
        case, the forwarder is responsible for switching the payloads between
        three entities: the AC, the service PW, and the DNI-PW.</t>

      <section title="Dual-Homing Local Protection Reference Scenarios">
        <t/>

        <section title="One-Side Dual-Homing Protection">
          <t><xref target="figure_2"/> illustrates the network scenario of dual-homing PW local
          protection where only one of the CEs is dual-homed to two PE nodes.
          CE1 is dual-homed to PE1 and PE2, while CE2 is single-homed to PE3.
          A DNI-PW is established between the dual-homing PEs, which is used
          to bridge traffic when a failure occurs in the PSN or the
          AC side. A dual-homing control mechanism enables the PEs and CE to
          determine which AC should be used to carry traffic between CE1 and
          the PSN. The necessary control mechanisms and protocol
          extensions are defined in <xref
          target="RFC8185"/>.</t>

          <t>This scenario can protect against node failure of PE1 or PE2 or
          failure of one of the ACs between CE1 and the dual-homing PEs. In
          addition, dual-homing PW protection can protect against failure occurring
          in the PSN that impacts the working PW; thus, it can be an
          alternative solution of PSN tunnel protection mechanisms. This
          topology can be used in mobile backhauling application scenarios.
          For example, CE2 might be an equipment cell site such as a NodeB,
          while CE1 is the shared Radio Network Controller (RNC). PE3
          functions as an access-side MPLS device, while PE1 and PE2 function
          as core-side MPLS devices.</t>

            </figure></t>

          <t>Consider the example where in normal state AC1 from CE1 to PE1 is
	  initially active and AC2 from CE1 to PE2 is initially standby. PW1
	  is configured as the working PW and PW2 is configured as the
	  protection PW.</t>

          <t>When a failure occurs in AC1, then the state of AC2 changes to
          active based on the AC dual-homing control mechanism. In order to
          keep the switchover local and continue using PW1 for traffic
          forwarding as preferred according to traffic planning, the forwarder
          on PE2 needs to connect AC2 to the DNI-PW, and the forwarder on PE1
          needs to connect the DNI-PW to PW1. In this way, the failure in AC1
          will not impact the forwarding of the service PWs across the
          network. After the switchover, traffic will go through the
          bidirectional path:
          CE1&nbhy;(AC2)-PE2-(DNI-PW)-PE1-(PW1)-PE3-(AC3)-CE2.</t>

          <t>When a failure in the PSN affects the working PW (PW1),
          according to PW protection mechanisms <xref target="RFC6378"/>,
          traffic is switched onto the protection PW (PW2) while the state of
          AC1 remains active. Then, the forwarder on PE1 needs to connect AC1
          to the DNI-PW, and the forwarder on PE2 needs to connect the DNI-PW
          to PW2. In this way, the failure in the PSN will not impact
          the state of the ACs. After the switchover, traffic will go through
          the bidirectional path:
          CE1&nbhy;(AC1)&nbhy;PE1-(DNI-PW)-PE2-(PW2)-PE3-(AC3)-CE2.</t>

          <t>When a failure occurs in the working PE (PE1), it is equivalent
          to a failure of the working AC, the working PW, and the DNI-PW. The
          state of AC2 changes to active based on the AC dual-homing control
          mechanism. In addition, according to the PW protection mechanism, traffic is
          switched on to the protection PW "PW2". In this case, the forwarder
          on PE2 needs to connect AC2 to PW2. After the switchover, traffic
          will go through the bidirectional path:
          CE1-(AC2)-PE2-(PW2)-PE3-(AC3)-CE2.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Two-Side Dual-Homing Protection">
          <t><xref target="figure_3"/> illustrates the network scenario of dual-homing PW
          protection where the CEs in both sides are dual-homed. CE1 is
          dual-homed to PE1 and PE2, and CE2 is dual-homed to PE3 and PE4. A
          dual-homing control mechanism enables the PEs and CEs to determine
          which AC should be used to carry traffic between the CE and the PSN. DNI-PWs are used between the dual-homing PEs on both sides.
          One service PW is established between PE1 and PE3, and another service
          PW is established between PE2 and PE4. The role of working and
          protection PWs can be determined by either configuration or 
          existing signaling mechanisms.</t>

          <t>This scenario can protect against node failure on one of the
          dual-homing PEs or failure on one of the ACs between the CEs
          and their dual-homing PEs. Also, dual-homing PW protection can
          protect against the occurrence of failure in the PSN that impacts one
          of the PWs; thus, it can be used as an alternative solution of PSN
          tunnel protection mechanisms. Note, this scenario is mainly used for
          services requiring high availability as it requires redundancy of
          the PEs and network utilization. In this case, CE1 and CE2 can be
          regarded as service access points.</t>

    <section title="Generic Dual-Homing PW Protection Mechanism">
      <t>As shown in the above scenarios, with the described dual-homing PW
      protection, failures in the AC side will not impact the forwarding
      behavior of the PWs in the PSN, and vice-versa.</t>

      <t>In order for the dual-homing PEs to coordinate traffic forwarding
      during failures, synchronization of the status information of the
      involved entities and coordination of switchover between the dual-homing
      PEs are needed. For PWs with a dynamic control plane, such
      synchronization and coordination information can be achieved with a dynamic
      protocol, such as that described in <xref target="RFC7275"/>, possibly with some
      extensions. For PWs that are manually configured without a control
      plane, a new mechanism is needed to exchange the status information and
      coordinate switchover between the dual-homing PEs, e.g., over an embedded
      PW control channel. This is described in <xref
      target="RFC8185"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The scenarios defined in this document do not affect the security
      model as defined in <xref target="RFC3985"/>.</t>

      <t>With the proposed protection mechanism, the disruption of a
      dual-homed AC, a component that is outside the core network, would have
      a reduced impact on the traffic flows in the core network. This could
      also avoid unnecessary congestion in the core network.</t>

      <t>The security consideration of the DNI-PW is the same as for service
      PWs in the data plane <xref target="RFC3985"/>. Security considerations
      for the coordination/control mechanism will be addressed in the
      companion document, RFC 8185, which defines the mechanism.
