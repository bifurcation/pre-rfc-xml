<section title="Introduction">

<section title="Scope and Target Audience">

<t>This document gives an overview of the IETF network management standards and
summarizes existing and ongoing development of IETF Standards Track network management protocols and data models. The document refers to other overview documents where they exist and classifies the standards for easy orientation.</t>

<t>The target audience of the document is, on the one hand, IETF working groups, which aim to select appropriate standard management protocols and data models to address their needs concerning network management. On the other hand, the document can be used as an overview and guideline by non-IETF Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) planning to use IETF management technologies and data models for the realization of management applications. The document can also be used to initiate a discussion between the bodies with the goal to gather new requirements and to detect possible gaps. Finally, this document is directed to all interested parties that seek to get an overview of the current set of the IETF network management protocols such as network administrators or newcomers to the IETF.</t>

<t>Section 2 gives an overview of the IETF core network management standards with a special focus on Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), syslog, IP Flow Information eXport / Packet SAMPling (IPFIX/PSAMP), and Network Configuration (NETCONF). <xref target="protocols" /> discusses IETF management protocols and mechanisms with a specific focus, e.g., IP address management or IP performance management. <xref target="dms" /> discusses IETF data models, such as MIB modules, IPFIX Information Elements, Syslog Structured Data Elements, and YANG modules designed to address a specific set of management issues and provides two complementary overviews for the network management data models standardized within the IETF. <xref target="i-dms" /> focuses on a broader view of models classified into categories such as generic and infrastructure data models as well as data models matched to different layers. Whereas <xref target="f-dms" /> structures the data models following the management application view and maps them to the network management tasks fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security management.</t>

<t>Appendix A guides the reader for the high-level selection of management standards. For this, the section classifies the protocols according to high-level criteria, such as push versus pull mechanisms, passive versus active monitoring, as well as categorizes the protocols concerning the network management task they address and their data model extensibility.
If the reader is interested only in a subset of the IETF network management protocols and data models described in this document, Appendix A can be used as a dispatcher to the corresponding chapter. Appendix B gives an overview of the new work on Energy Management in the IETF.</t>

<t>This document mainly refers to Proposed, Draft, or Internet Standard documents from the IETF (see <xref target="RFCSEARCH" />). Whenever valuable, Best Current Practice (BCP) documents are referenced. In exceptional cases, and if the document provides substantial guideline for standard usage or fills an essential gap, Experimental and Informational RFCs are noticed and ongoing work is mentioned.</t>

<t>Information on active and concluded IETF working groups (e.g., their charters, published or currently active documents, and mail archives) can be found at <xref target="IETF-WGS" />).</t>

<t>Note that this document does not cover OAM technologies on the data-path including MPLS forwarding plane and control plane protocols (e.g., OAM of tunnels, MPLS-TP OAM, and pseudowire) as well as the corresponding management models and MIB modules. For a list of related work, see <xref target="relwork"/>.</t>

</section> <!-- Scope and Target Audience -->


<section anchor="relwork" title="Related Work">


<t>"Internet Protocols for the Smart Grid" <xref target="RFC6272"/> gives an overview and guidance on the key protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite. In analogy to <xref target="RFC6272"/>, this document gives an overview of the IETF network management standards and their usage scenarios.</t>

<t>"Overview of the 2002 IAB Network Management Workshop" <xref
target="RFC3535"/> documented strengths and weaknesses of some IETF management protocols. In choosing existing protocol solutions to meet the management requirements, it is recommended that these strengths and weaknesses be considered, even though some of the recommendations from the 2002 IAB workshop have become outdated, some have been standardized, and some are being worked on within the IETF.</t>

<t>"Guidelines for Considering Operations and
Management of New Protocols and Extensions" <xref target="RFC5706"/> recommends working groups consider
operations and management needs and then select appropriate management
protocols and data models. This document can be used to ease surveying the IETF
Standards Track network management protocols and management data models.</t>
<t>"Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Management Overview" <xref
target="RFC4221"/> describes the management architecture for MPLS and indicates
the interrelationships between the different MIB modules used for MPLS network
management, where "Operations, Administration, and Maintenance Framework
for MPLS-Based Transport Networks" <xref target="RFC6371"/> describes the OAM Framework for MPLS-based Transport Networks.</t>

<t>"An Overview of Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)
Mechanisms" <xref target="OAM-OVERVIEW"/> gives an overview of the OAM toolset for detecting and reporting connection failures or measuring connection performance parameters.</t>

<t>"An Overview of the OAM Tool Set for MPLS-based Transport Networks" <xref target="OAM-ANALYSIS" /> provides an overview of the OAM toolset for MPLS-based Transport Networks including a brief summary of MPLS-TP OAM requirements and functions and of generic mechanisms created in the MPLS data plane to allow the OAM packets run in-band and share their fate with data packets.  The protocol definitions for each MPLS-TP OAM tool are listed in separate documents, which are referenced.</t>


<t><xref target="MPLSTP-MIB" >"MPLS-TP MIB-based Management Overview"</xref> describes the MIB-based architecture for MPLS-TP, and indicates the interrelationships between different existing MIB modules that can be leveraged for MPLS-TP network management and identifies areas where additional MIB modules are required.</t>

<t>Note that so far, the IETF has not developed specific technologies for the management of sensor networks. IP-based sensors or constrained devices in such an environment, i.e., with very limited memory and CPU resources, can use, e.g., application-layer protocols to do simple resource management and monitoring.</t>

<section anchor="snmp" title="Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)">

<section title="Architectural Principles of SNMP" anchor="princ_of_snmp">

<t>The SNMPv3 Framework <xref target="RFC3410"/>, builds upon both the original SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 Frameworks. The basic structure and components for the SNMP Framework did not change between its versions and comprises the following components:

<list style="symbols">
<t>managed nodes, each with an SNMP entity providing remote access to management instrumentation (the agent),</t>
<t>at least one SNMP entity with management applications (the manager), and</t>
<t>a management protocol used to convey management information between the SNMP entities and management information.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>During its evolution, the fundamental architecture of the SNMP Management Framework remained consistent based on a modular architecture, which consists of:

<list style="symbols">
<t>a generic protocol definition independent of the data it is carrying,</t>
<t>a protocol-independent data definition language,</t>
<t>an information repository containing a data set of management information definitions (the Management Information Base, or MIB), and</t>
<t>security and administration.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>As such, the following standards build up the basis of the current SNMP Management Framework:</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>the SNMPv3 protocol <xref target="STD62"/>,</t>
<t>the modeling language SMIv2 <xref target="STD58"/>, and</t>
<t>the MIB modules for different management issues.</t>
</list>

<t>The SNMPv3 Framework extends the architectural principles of SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 by:</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>building on these three basic architectural components, in some cases, incorporating them from the SNMPv2 Framework by reference, and</t>
<t>by using the same layering principles in the definition of new capabilities in the security and administration portion of the architecture.</t>
</list>

</section> <!-- Architectural Principles of SNMP -->

<section title="SNMP and Its Versions">

<t>SNMP is based on three conceptual entities: Manager, Agent, and the Management Information Base (MIB). In any configuration, at least one manager node runs SNMP management software. Typically, network devices, such as bridges, routers, and servers, are equipped with an agent. The agent is responsible for providing access to a local MIB of objects that reflects the resources and activity at its node. Following the manager-agent paradigm, an agent can generate notifications and send them as unsolicited messages to the management application.</t>

<t>SNMPv2 enhances this basic functionality with an Inform PDU, a bulk transfer capability and other functional extensions like an administrative model for access control, security extensions, and Manager-to-Manager communication. SNMPv2 entities can have a dual role as manager and agent. However, neither SNMPv1 nor SNMPv2 offers sufficient security features. To address the security deficiencies of SNMPv1/v2, SNMPv3 <xref target="STD62"/> has been issued.</t>

<t><xref target="BCP074">"Coexistence between Version 1, Version 2, and Version 3 of the Internet-standard Network Management Framework"</xref> gives an overview of the relevant Standard documents on the three SNMP versions. The BCP document furthermore describes how to convert MIB modules from SMIv1 to SMIv2 format and how to translate notification parameters.  It also describes the mapping between the message processing and security models.</t>

<t>SNMP utilizes the MIB, a virtual information store of modules of managed objects. Generally, standard MIB modules support common functionality in a device. Operators often define additional MIB modules for their enterprise or use the Command Line Interface (CLI) to configure non-standard data in managed devices and their interfaces.</t>

<t>SNMPv2 Trap and Inform PDUs can alert an operator or an application when some aspects of a protocol fail or encounter an error condition, and the contents of a notification can be used to guide subsequent SNMP polling to gather additional information about an event.</t>

<t>SNMP is widely used for the monitoring of fault and performance data and with its stateless nature, SNMP also works well for status polling and determining the operational state of specific functionality. The widespread use of counters in standard MIB modules permits the interoperable comparison of statistics across devices from different vendors. Counters have been especially useful in monitoring bytes and packets going in and out over various protocol interfaces. SNMP is often used to poll a basic parameter of a device (e.g., sysUpTime, which reports the time since the last re-initialization of the network management portion of the device) to check for operational liveliness and to detect discontinuities in counters. Some operators also use SNMP for configuration management in their environment (e.g., for systems based on Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) such as cable modems).</t>

<t>SNMPv1 <xref target="RFC1157"/> has been declared Historic and its use is not recommended due to its lack of security features. <xref target="RFC1901">"Introduction to Community-based SNMPv2"</xref> is an Experimental RFC, which has been declared Historic, and its use is not recommended due to its lack of security features.</t>

<t>Use of SNMPv3 <xref target="STD62"/> is recommended due to its security features, including support for authentication, encryption, message timeliness and integrity checking, and fine-grained data access controls. An overview of the SNMPv3 document set is in <xref target="RFC3410"/>.</t>

<t>Standards exist to use SNMP over diverse transport and link-layer protocols, including Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) <xref target="STD07"/>, User Datagram Protocol (UDP) <xref target="STD06"/>, Ethernet <xref target="RFC4789"/>, and others (see <xref target="snmptsv"/>).</t>

</section> <!-- SNMP and its Versions -->


<section anchor="smi" title="Structure of Managed Information (SMI)">

<t>SNMP MIB modules are defined with the notation and grammar specified as the Structure of Managed Information (SMI). The SMI uses an adapted subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) <xref target="ITU-X680"/>.</t>

<t>The SMI is divided into three parts: module definitions, object definitions, and notification definitions.</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>Module definitions are used when describing information modules. An ASN.1 macro, MODULE-IDENTITY, is used to concisely convey the semantics of an information module.</t>
<t>Object definitions are used when describing managed objects. An ASN.1 macro, OBJECT-TYPE, is used to concisely convey the syntax and semantics of a managed object.</t>
<t>Notification definitions are used when describing unsolicited transmissions of management information. An ASN.1 macro, NOTIFICATION-TYPE, is used to concisely convey the syntax and semantics of a notification.</t>
</list>

<t>SMIv1 is specified in <xref target="RFC1155">"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets"</xref> and <xref target="RFC1212">"Concise MIB Definitions"</xref>, both part of <xref target="STD16" />. <xref target="RFC1215"/> specifies conventions for defining SNMP traps. Note that SMIv1 is outdated and its use is not recommended.</t>

<t>SMIv2 is the new notation for managed information definitions and should be used to define MIB modules. SMIv2 is specified in the following RFCs.  With the exception of BCP 74, they are all part of <xref target="STD58" />:</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t><xref target="RFC2578"/> defines Version 2 of the Structure of Management Information (SMIv2),</t>
<t><xref target="RFC2579"/> defines the textual conventions macro for defining new types and it provides a core set of generally useful textual convention definitions,</t>
<t><xref target="RFC2580"/> defines conformance statements and requirements for defining agent and manager capabilities, and</t>
<t><xref target="BCP074"/> defines the mapping rules for and the conversion of MIB modules between SMIv1 and SMIv2 formats.</t>

<section anchor="snmpsec" title="Security Requirements on the SNMP Management Framework">

<t>Several of the classical threats to network protocols are applicable to management problem space and therefore are applicable to any security model used in an SNMP Management Framework. This section lists primary and secondary threats, and threats that are of lesser importance (see <xref target="RFC3411"/> for the detailed description of the security threats).</t>

<t>The primary threats against which SNMP Security Models can provide protection are, "modification of information" by an unauthorized entity, and "masquerade", i.e., the danger that management operations not authorized for some principal may be attempted by assuming the identity of another principal.</t>
<t>Secondary threats against which SNMP Security Models can provide protection are "message stream modification", e.g., reordering, delay, or replay of messages, and "disclosure", i.e., the danger of eavesdropping on the exchanges between SNMP engines.</t>

<t>There are two threats against which the SNMP Security Model does not protect, since they are deemed to be of lesser importance in this context: Denial of Service and Traffic Analysis (see <xref target="RFC3411"/>).</t>

<section anchor="snmpusm" title="User-Based Security Model (USM)">

<t>SNMPv3 <xref target="STD62"/> introduced the User-based Security Model (USM). USM is specified in <xref target="RFC3414"/> and provides authentication and privacy services for SNMP. Specifically, USM is designed to secure against the primary and secondary threats discussed in <xref target="snmpsec"/>. USM does not secure against Denial of Service and attacks based on Traffic Analysis.</t>

<t>The USM supports following security services:</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>Data integrity is the provision of the property that data has not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner, nor have data sequences been altered to an extent greater than can occur non-maliciously.</t>
<t>Data origin authentication is the provision of the property that the claimed identity of the user on whose behalf received data was originated is supported.</t>
<t>Data confidentiality is the provision of the property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.</t>
<t>Message timeliness and limited replay protection is the provision of the property that a message whose generation time is outside of a specified time window is not accepted.</t>
</list>

<t>See <xref target="RFC3414"/> for a detailed description of SNMPv3 USM.</t>

</section> <!-- User-Based Security Model (USM)-->


<section anchor="snmpvacm" title="View-Based Access Control Model (VACM)">

<t>SNMPv3 <xref target="STD62"/> introduced the View-based Access Control (VACM) facility. The VACM is defined in <xref target="RFC3415"/> and enables the configuration of agents to provide different levels of access to the agent's MIB. An agent entity can restrict access to a certain portion of its MIB, e.g., restrict some principals to view only performance-related statistics or disallow other principals to read those performance-related statistics. An agent entity can also restrict the access to monitoring (read-only) as opposed to monitoring and configuration (read-write) of a certain portion of its MIB, e.g., allowing only a single designated principal to update configuration parameters.</t>

<t>VACM defines five elements that make up the Access Control Model: groups, security level, contexts, MIB views, and access policy. Access to a MIB module is controlled by means of a MIB view.</t>


<t>See <xref target="RFC3415"/> for a detailed description of SNMPv3 VACM.</t>

</section> <!-- SNMP Security and Access Control Models -->


<section title="SNMP Transport Subsystem and Transport Models">

<t>The User-based Security Model (USM) was designed to be independent of other existing security infrastructures to ensure it could function when third-party authentication services were not available. As a result, USM utilizes a separate user and key-management infrastructure. Operators have reported that the deployment of a separate user and key-management infrastructure in order to use SNMPv3 is costly and hinders the deployment of SNMPv3.</t>

<t>SNMP Transport Subsystem <xref target="RFC5590"/> extends the original SNMP architecture and Transport Model and enables the use of transport protocols to provide message security unifying the administrative security management for SNMP and other management interfaces.</t>

<t>Transport Models are tied into the SNMP Framework through the Transport Subsystem. The Transport Security Model <xref target="RFC5591"/> has been designed to work on top of lower-layer, secure Transport Models.</t>

<t>The SNMP Transport Model defines an alternative to existing standard transport mappings described in <xref target="RFC3417"/>, e.g., for SNMP over UDP, in <xref target="RFC4789"/> for SNMP over IEEE 802 networks, and in the Experimental RFC <xref target="RFC3430"/> defining SNMP over TCP.</t>

<section anchor="snmptsv" title="SNMP Transport Security Model">

<t>The SNMP Transport Security Model <xref target="RFC5591"/> is an alternative to the existing SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 Community-based Security Models <xref target="BCP074"/>, and the User-based Security Model <xref target="RFC3414"/>, part of <xref target="STD62" />.</t>

<t>The Transport Security Model utilizes one or more lower-layer security mechanisms to provide message-oriented security services. These include authentication of the sender, encryption, timeliness checking, and data integrity checking.</t>

<t>A secure Transport Model sets up an authenticated and possibly encrypted session between the Transport Models of two SNMP engines. After a transport-layer session is established, SNMP messages can be sent through this session from one SNMP engine to the other. The new Transport Model supports the sending of multiple SNMP messages through the same session to amortize the costs of establishing a security association.</t>

<t>The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Model <xref target="RFC5592"/> and the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Transport Model <xref target="RFC6353"/> are current examples of Transport Security Models.</t>

<t>The SSH Transport Model makes use of the commonly deployed SSH security and key-management infrastructure. Furthermore, <xref target="RFC5592"/> defines MIB objects for monitoring and managing the SSH Transport Model for SNMP.</t>

<t>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Transport Model <xref target="RFC6353"/> uses either the TLS protocol <xref target="RFC5246"/> or the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol <xref target="RFC6347"/>. The TLS and DTLS protocols provide authentication and privacy services for SNMP applications. The TLS Transport Model supports the sending of SNMP messages over TLS and TCP and over DTLS and UDP. Furthermore, <xref target="RFC6353"/> defines MIB objects for managing the TLS Transport Model for SNMP.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC5608"/> describes the use of a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) service by SNMP secure Transport Models for authentication of users and authorization of services. Access control authorization, i.e., how RADIUS attributes and messages are applied to the specific application area of SNMP Access Control Models, and VACM in particular has been specified in <xref target="RFC6065"/>.</t>

<section anchor="syslog" title="Syslog Protocol">

<t>Syslog is a mechanism for distribution of logging information initially used on Unix systems (see <xref target="RFC3164"/> for BSD syslog). The IETF Syslog Protocol <xref target="RFC5424"/> introduces a layered architecture allowing the use of any number of transport protocols, including reliable and secure transports, for transmission of syslog messages.</t>

<t>The Syslog protocol enables a machine to send system log messages across networks to event message collectors. The protocol is simply designed to transport and distribute these event messages. By default, no acknowledgements of the receipt are made, except the reliable delivery extensions specified in <xref target="RFC3195"/> are used. The Syslog protocol and process does not require a stringent coordination between the transport sender and the receiver. Indeed, the transmission of syslog messages may be started on a device without a receiver being configured, or even actually physically present. Conversely, many devices will most likely be able to receive messages without explicit configuration or definitions.</t>

<t>BSD syslog had little uniformity for the message format and the content of syslog messages. The body of a BSD syslog message has traditionally been unstructured text. This content is human friendly, but difficult to parse for applications. With the Syslog Protocol <xref target="RFC5424" />, the IETF has standardized a new message header format, including timestamp, hostname, application, and message ID, to improve filtering, interoperability, and correlation between compliant implementations.</t>

<t>The Syslog protocol <xref target="RFC5424"/> also introduces a mechanism for defining Structured Data Elements (SDEs). The SDEs allow vendors to define their own structured data elements to supplement standardized elements. <xref target="RFC5675"/> defines a mapping from SNMP notifications to syslog messages. <xref target="RFC5676"/> defines an SNMP MIB module to represent
syslog messages for the purpose of sending those 
syslog messages as notifications to SNMP
notification receivers.  <xref target="RFC5674"/> defines the way alarms are sent in syslog, which includes the mapping of ITU-perceived severities onto syslog message fields and a number of alarm-specific definitions from ITU-T X.733 <xref target="ITU-X733"/> and the IETF Alarm MIB <xref target="RFC3877"/>.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC5848">"Signed Syslog Messages"</xref> defines a mechanism to add origin authentication, message integrity, replay resistance, message sequencing, and detection of missing messages to the transmitted syslog messages to be used in conjunction with the Syslog protocol.</t>

<t>The Syslog protocol's layered architecture provides support for a number of transport mappings. For interoperability purposes and especially in managed networks, where the network path has been explicitly provisioned for UDP syslog traffic, the Syslog protocol can be used over UDP <xref target="RFC5426"/>. However, to support congestion control and reliability, <xref target="RFC5426"/> strongly recommends the use of the TLS transport.</t>

<t>Furthermore, the IETF defined the TLS Transport Mapping for syslog in <xref target="RFC5425"/>, which provides a secure connection for the transport of syslog messages. <xref target="RFC5425"/> describes the security threats to syslog and how TLS can be used to counter such threats. <xref target="RFC6012"/> defines the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Transport Mapping for syslog, which can be used if a connectionless transport is desired.</t>

<section anchor="ipfix" title="IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX) and Packet SAMPling (PSAMP) Protocols">


<t>"Specification of the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Protocol for the Exchange of IP Traffic Flow Information" (the IPFIX Protocol) <xref target="RFC5101"/> defines a push-based data export mechanism for transferring IP flow information in a compact binary format from an Exporter to a Collector.</t>

<t>"Architecture for IP Flow Information Export" (the IPFIX Architecture) <xref target="RFC5470"/> defines the components involved in IP flow measurement and reporting of information on IP flows, particularly, a Metering Process generating Flow Records, an Exporting Process that sends metered flow information using the IPFIX protocol, and a Collecting Process that receives flow information as IPFIX Data Records.</t>

<t>After listing the IPFIX requirements in <xref target="RFC3917"/>, NetFlow Version 9 <xref target="RFC3954"/> was taken as the basis for the IPFIX protocol and the IPFIX architecture.</t>
 
<t>IPFIX can run over different transport protocols. The IPFIX Protocol <xref target="RFC5101"/> specifies Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) <xref target="RFC4960"/> as the mandatory transport protocol to implement. Optional alternatives are TCP <xref target="STD07"/> and UDP <xref target="STD06"/>.</t>

<t>SCTP is used with its Partial Reliability extension (PR-SCTP) specified in <xref target="RFC3758"/>. <xref target="RFC6526" /> specifies an extension to <xref target="RFC5101"/>, when using the PR-SCTP <xref target="RFC3758"/>. The extension offers several advantages over IPFIX export, e.g., the ability to calculate Data Record losses for PR-SCTP, immediate reuse of Template IDs within an SCTP stream, reduced likelihood of Data Record loss, and reduced demands on the Collecting Process.</t>

<t>IPFIX transmits IP flow information in Data Records containing IPFIX Information Elements (IEs) defined by the IPFIX Information Model <xref target="RFC5102"/>. IPFIX IEs are quantities with unit and semantics defined by the Information Model. When transmitted over the IPFIX protocol, only their values need to be carried in Data Records. This compact encoding allows efficient transport of large numbers of measured flow values. Remaining redundancy in Data Records can be further reduced by the methods described in <xref target="RFC5473"/> (for further discussion on IPFIX IEs, see <xref target="dms"/>).</t>

<t>The IPFIX Information Model is extensible. New IEs can be registered at IANA (see "IPFIX Information Elements" in <xref target="IANA-PROT"/>). IPFIX also supports the use of proprietary, i.e., enterprise-specific IEs.</t>

<t>The PSAMP protocol <xref target="RFC5476"/> extends the IPFIX protocol by means of transferring information on individual packets. <xref target="RFC5475"/> specifies a set of sampling and filtering techniques for IP packet selection, based on the PSAMP Framework <xref target="RFC5474"/>. The PSAMP Information Model <xref target="RFC5477"/> provides a set of basic IEs for reporting packet information with the IPFIX/PSAMP protocol.</t>

<t>The IPFIX model of an IP traffic flow is unidirectional. <xref target="RFC5103"/> adds means of reporting bidirectional flows to IPFIX, for example, both directions of packet flows of a TCP connection.</t>

<t>When enterprise-specific IEs are transmitted with IPFIX, a Collector receiving Data Records may not know the type of received data and cannot choose the right format for storing the contained information. <xref target="RFC5610"/> provides a means of exporting extended type information for enterprise-specific Information Elements from an Exporter to a Collector.</t>

<t>Collectors may store received flow information in files. The IPFIX file format <xref target="RFC5655"/> can be used for storing IP flow information in a way that facilitates exchange of traffic flow information between different systems and applications.</t>

<t>In terms of IPFIX and PSAMP configurations, the Metering and Exporting Processes are configured out of band. As the IPFIX protocol is a push mechanism only, IPFIX cannot configure the Exporter. The actual configuration of selection processes, caches, Exporting Processes, and Collecting Processes of IPFIX- and PSAMP-compliant monitoring devices is executed using the NETCONF protocol <xref target="RFC6241"/> (see <xref target="netconf"/>). The "Configuration Data Model for IPFIX and PSAMP" (the IPFIX Configuration Data Model) <xref target="CONF-MODEL" /> has been specified using Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams. The data model is formally defined using the YANG modeling language <xref target="RFC6020"/> (see <xref target="yangdml"/>).</t>

<t>At the time of this writing, a framework for IPFIX flow mediation is in preparation, which addresses the need for mediation of flow information in IPFIX applications in large operator networks, e.g., for aggregating huge amounts of flow data and for anonymization of flow information (see the problem statement in <xref target="RFC5982"/>).</t>

<t>The IPFIX Mediation Framework <xref target="RFC6183"/> defines the intermediate device between Exporters and Collectors, which provides an IPFIX mediation by receiving a record stream from, e.g., a Collecting Process, hosting one or more Intermediate Processes to transform this stream, and exporting the transformed record stream into IPFIX messages via an Exporting Process.</t>

<t>Examples for mediation functions are flow aggregation, flow selection, and anonymization of traffic information (see <xref target="RFC6235"/>).</t>

<t>Privacy, integrity, and authentication of the Exporter and Collector are important security requirements for IPFIX <xref target="RFC3917"/>. Confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of IPFIX data transferred from an Exporting Process to a Collecting Process must be ensured. The IPFIX and PSAMP protocols do not define any new security mechanisms and rely on the security mechanism of the underlying transport protocol, such as TLS <xref target="RFC5246"/> and DTLS <xref target="RFC6347"/>.</t>

<t>The primary goal of IPFIX is the reporting of the flow accounting for flexible flow definitions and usage-based accounting. As described in the IPFIX Applicability Statement <xref target="RFC5472"/>, there are also other applications such as traffic profiling, traffic engineering, intrusion detection, and QoS monitoring, that require flow-based traffic measurements and can be realized using IPFIX. Furthermore, the IPFIX Applicability Statement explains the relation of IPFIX to other framework and protocols such as PSAMP, RMON (Remote Network Monitoring MIB, <xref target="secfm"/>), and IPPM (IP Performance Metrics, <xref target="ippm"/>)). Similar flow information could be also used for security monitoring. The addition of Performance Metrics in the IPFIX IANA registry <xref target="IANA-IPFIX"/>, will extend the IPFIX use case to performance management.</t>

<t>Note that even if the initial IPFIX focus has been around IP flow information exchange, non-IP-related IEs are now specified in the IPFIX IANA registration (e.g., MAC (Media Access Control) address, MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) labels, etc.). At the time of this writing, there are requests to widen the focus of IPFIX and to export non-IP related IEs (such as SIP monitoring IEs).</t>

<t>The IPFIX structured data <xref target="RFC6313"/> is an extension to the IPFIX protocol, which supports hierarchical structured data and lists (sequences) of Information Elements in Data Records. This extension allows the definition of complex data structures such as variable-length lists and specification of hierarchical containment relationships between templates. Furthermore, the extension provides the semantics to express the relationship among multiple list elements in a structured Data Record.</t>

<section title="Network Configuration">

<section anchor="netconf" title="Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)">

<t>The IAB workshop on Network Management <xref target="RFC3535"/> determined advanced requirements for configuration management:</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>robustness: Minimizing disruptions and maximizing stability,</t>
<t>a task-oriented view,</t>
<t>extensibility for new operations,</t>
<t>standardized error handling,</t>
<t>clear distinction between configuration data and operational state,</t>
<t>distribution of configurations to devices under transactional constraints,</t>

<t>a data modeling language with a human-friendly syntax,</t>
<t>easy conflict detection and configuration validation, and</t>
<t>secure transport, authentication, and robust access control.</t>
</list>

<t>The NETCONF protocol <xref target="RFC6241"/> provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices and aims to address the configuration management requirements pointed out in the IAB workshop. It uses an XML-based data encoding for the configuration data as well as the protocol messages. The NETCONF protocol operations are realized on top of a simple and reliable Remote Procedure Call (RPC) layer. A key aspect of NETCONF is that it allows the functionality of the management protocol to closely mirror the native command-line interface of the device.</t>

<t>The NETCONF working group developed the NETCONF Event Notifications Mechanism as an optional capability, which provides an asynchronous message notification delivery service for NETCONF <xref target="RFC5277"/>. The NETCONF notification mechanism enables using general purpose notification streams, where the originator of the notification stream can be any managed device (e.g., SNMP notifications).</t>

<t>The NETCONF Partial Locking specification introduces fine-grained locking of the configuration datastore to enhance NETCONF for fine-grained transactions on parts of the datastore <xref target="RFC5717"/>.</t>

<t>The NETCONF working group also defined the necessary data model to
   monitor the NETCONF protocol <xref target="RFC6022"/>, by using the modeling language YANG <xref target="RFC6020" /> (see <xref target="yangdml"/>). The monitoring data model includes information about NETCONF datastores, sessions, locks, and statistics, which facilitate the management of a NETCONF server.</t>

<t>NETCONF connections are required to provide authentication, data integrity, confidentiality, and replay protection. NETCONF depends on the underlying transport protocol for this capability. For example, connections can be encrypted in TLS or SSH, depending on the underlying protocol.</t>

<t>The NETCONF working group defined the SSH transport protocol as the mandatory transport binding <xref target="RFC6242"/>. Other optional transport bindings are TLS <xref target="RFC5539"/>, Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP) over TLS <xref target="RFC4744"/>, and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) over HTTP over TLS <xref target="RFC4743"/>.</t>

<t>The NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM) <xref target="RFC6536"/> provides standard mechanisms to restrict protocol access to particular users with a pre-configured subset of operations and content.</t>

<section anchor="yangdml" title="YANG - NETCONF Data Modeling Language">

<t>Following the guidelines of the IAB management workshop <xref target="RFC3535"/>, the NETMOD working group developed a data modeling language defining the semantics of operational and configuration data, notifications, and operations <xref target="RFC6020"/>. The new data modeling language, called YANG, maps directly to XML-encoded content (on the wire) and will serve as the normative description of NETCONF data models.</t>

<t>YANG has the following properties addressing specific requirements on a modeling language for configuration management:</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>YANG provides the means to define hierarchical data models. It supports reusable data types and groupings, i.e., a set of schema nodes that can be reused across module boundaries.</t>

<t>YANG supports the distinction between configuration and state data. In addition, it provides support for modeling event notifications and the specification of operations that extend the base NETCONF operations.</t>

<t>YANG allows the expression of constraints on data models by means of type restrictions and XML Path Language (XPATH) 1.0 <xref target="XPATH"/> expressions. XPATH expressions can also be used to make certain portions of a data model conditional.</t>

<t>YANG supports the integration of standard- and vendor-defined data models. YANG's augmentation mechanism allows the seamless augmentation of standard data models with proprietary extensions.</t>

<t>YANG data models can be partitioned into collections of features, allowing low-end devices only to implement the core features of a data model while high-end devices may choose to support all features. The supported features are announced via the NETCONF capability exchange to management applications.</t>

<t>The syntax of the YANG language is compact and optimized for human readers. An associated XML-based syntax called the YANG Independent Notation (YIN) <xref target="RFC6020"/> is available to allow the processing of YANG data models with XML-based tools. The mapping rules for the translation of YANG data models into Document Schema Definition Languages (DSDL), of which RELAX NG is a major component, are defined in <xref target="RFC6110"/>.</t>

<t>Devices implementing standard data models can document deviations from the data model in separate YANG modules. Applications capable of discovering deviations can make allowances that would otherwise not be possible.</t>

</list>

<t>A collection of common data types for IETF-related standards is provided in <xref target="RFC6021"/>. This standard data type library has been derived to a large extend from common SMIv2 data types, generalizing them to a less-constrained NETCONF Framework.</t>

<t>The document "An Architecture for Network Management using NETCONF and YANG" describes how NETCONF and YANG can be used to build network management applications that meet the needs of network operators <xref target="RFC6244"/>.</t>

<t>The Experimental RFC <xref target="RFC6095"/> specifies extensions for YANG, introducing language abstractions such as class inheritance and recursive data structures.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC6087"/> gives guidelines for the use of YANG within the IETF and other standardization organizations.</t>

<t>Work is underway to standardize a translation of SMIv2 data models into YANG data models preserving investments into SNMP MIB modules, which are widely available for monitoring purposes <xref target="SMI-YANG" />.</t>

<t>Several independent and open source implementations of the YANG data modeling language and associated tools are available.</t>

<t>While YANG is a relatively recent data modeling language, some data models
have already been produced. The specification of the base NETCONF protocol
operations has been revised and uses YANG as the normative modeling language to
specify its operations <xref target="RFC6241"/>. The IPFIX working group prepared the normative model for configuring and monitoring IPFIX- and PSAMP-compliant monitoring devices using the YANG modeling language <xref target="CONF-MODEL" />.</t>

<t>At the time of this writing, the NETMOD working group is developing core system and interface data models. Following the example of the IPFIX configuration model, IETF working groups will prepare models for their specific needs.</t>

<section anchor="protocols" title="Network Management Protocols and Mechanisms with Specific Focus">

<t>This section reviews additional protocols the IETF offers for management and discusses for which applications they were designed and/or have already been successfully deployed. These are protocols that have mostly reached Proposed Standard status or higher within the IETF.</t>

<section title="IP Address Management">

<section anchor="dhcp" title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)">

<t>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) <xref target="RFC2131"/> provides a framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP network and, as such, enables autoconfiguration in IP networks. In addition to IP address management, DHCP can also provide other configuration information, such as default routers, the IP addresses of recursive DNS servers, and the IP addresses of NTP servers. As described in <xref target="RFC6272"/>, DHCP can be used for IPv4 and IPv6 Address Allocation and Assignment as well as for Service Discovery.</t>

<t>There are two versions of DHCP: one for IPv4 (DHCPv4) <xref target="RFC2131"/> and one for IPv6 (DHCPv6) <xref target="RFC3315"/>. DHCPv4 was defined as an extension to BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) <xref target="RFC0951"/>. DHCPv6 was subsequently defined to accommodate new functions required by IPv6 such as assignment of multiple addresses to an interface and to address limitations in the design of DHCPv4 resulting from its origins in BOOTP. While both versions bear the same name and perform the same functionality, the details of DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 are sufficiently different that they can be considered separate protocols.</t>

<t>In addition to the assignment of IP addresses and other configuration information, DHCP options like the Relay Agent Information option (DHCPv4) <xref target="RFC3046"/> and, the Interface-Id Option (DHCPv6) <xref target="RFC3315"/> are widely used by ISPs.</t>

<t>DHCPv6 includes Prefix Delegation <xref target="RFC3633"/>, which is used to provision a router with an IPv6 prefix for use in the subnetwork supported by the router.</t>

<t>The following are examples of DHCP options that provide configuration information or access to specific servers. A complete list of DHCP options is available at <xref target="IANA-PROT"/>.</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t><xref target="RFC3646">"DNS Configuration options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPV6 (DHCPv6)"</xref> describes DHCPv6 options for passing a list of available DNS recursive name servers and a domain search list to a client.</t>
<t><xref target="RFC2610">"DHCP Options for Service Location Protocol"</xref> describes DHCPv4 options and methods through which entities using the Service Location Protocol can find out the address of Directory Agents in order to transact messages and how the assignment of scope for configuration of Service Location Protocol (SLP) User and Service Agents can be achieved.</t>
<t><xref target="RFC3319">"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv6) Options for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Servers"</xref> specifies DHCPv6 options that allow SIP clients to locate a local SIP server that is to be used for all outbound SIP requests, a so-called "outbound proxy server".</t>
<t><xref target="RFC4280">"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Options for Broadcast and Multicast Control Servers"</xref> defines DHCPv6 options to discover the Broadcast and Multicast Service (BCMCS) controller in an IP network.</t>
</list>

<t>Built directly on UDP and IP, DHCP itself has no security provisions. There are two different classes of potential security issues related to DHCP: unauthorized DHCP Servers and unauthorized DHCP Clients. The recommended solutions to these risks generally involve providing security at lower layers, e.g., careful control over physical access to the network, security techniques implemented at Layer 2 but also IPsec at Layer 3 can be used to provide authentication.</t>

<section anchor="adhoc" title="Ad Hoc Network Autoconfiguration">

<t>Ad hoc nodes need to configure their network interfaces with locally unique addresses as well as globally routable IPv6 addresses, in order to communicate with devices on the Internet. The IETF AUTOCONF working group developed <xref target="RFC5889"/>, which describes the addressing model for ad hoc networks and how nodes in these networks configure their addresses.</t>

<t>The ad hoc nodes under consideration are expected to be able to support multi-hop communication by running MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Network) routing protocols as developed by the IETF MANET working group.</t>

<t>From the IP layer perspective, an ad hoc network presents itself as a Layer 3 multi-hop network formed over a collection of links. The addressing model aims to avoid problems for parts of the system that are ad hoc unaware, such as standard applications running on an ad hoc node or regular Internet nodes attached to the ad hoc nodes.</t>

<section anchor="policy" title="Policy-Based Management">

<section title="IETF Policy Framework">

<t>The IETF specified a general policy framework <xref target="RFC2753"/> for managing, sharing, and reusing policies in a vendor-independent, interoperable, and scalable manner. <xref target="RFC3460"/> specifies the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) as an object-oriented information model for representing policy information. PCIM has been developed jointly in the IETF Policy Framework (POLICY) working group and the Common Information Model (CIM) activity in the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF). PCIM has been published as extensions to CIM <xref target="DMTF-CIM"/>.</t>

<t>The IETF Policy Framework is based on a policy-based admission control specifying two main architectural elements: the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) and the Policy Decision Point (PDP). For the purpose of network management, policies allow an operator to specify how the network is to be configured and monitored by using a descriptive language. Furthermore, it allows the automation of a number of management tasks, according to the requirements set out in the policy module.</t>

<t>The IETF Policy Framework has been accepted by the industry as a standard-based policy management approach and has been adopted by different SDOs, e.g., for 3GGP charging standards.</t>
 
</section> <!-- IETF Policy Framework -->

<section anchor="cops" title="Use of Common Open Policy Service (COPS) for Policy Provisioning (COPS-PR)">

<t><xref target="RFC3159"/> defines the Structure of Policy Provisioning Information (SPPI), an extension to the SMIv2 modeling language used to write Policy Information Base (PIB) modules. COPS-PR <xref target="RFC3084"/> uses the Common Open Policy Service (COPS) protocol <xref target="RFC2748"/> for the provisioning of policy information. COPS provides a simple client/server model for supporting policy control over QoS signaling protocols. The COPS-PR specification is independent of the type of policy being provisioned (QoS, security, etc.) but focuses on the mechanisms and conventions used to communicate provisioned information between policy-decision-points (PDPs) and policy enforcement points (PEPs). Policy data is modeled using PIB modules.</t>

<t>COPS-PR has not been widely deployed, and operators have stated that its use of binary encoding for management data makes it difficult to develop automated scripts for simple configuration management tasks in most text-based scripting languages. In the IAB Workshop on Network Management <xref target="RFC3535"/>, the consensus of operators and protocol developers indicated a lack of interest in PIB modules for use with COPS-PR.</t>

<t>As a result, even if COPS-PR and the Structure of Policy Provisioning
Information (SPPI) were initially approved as Proposed Standards, the
IESG has not approved any PIB modules as Proposed Standard, 
and the use of COPS-PR is not recommended.</t>

<section anchor="ippm" title="IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)">

<t>The IPPM working group has defined metrics for accurately measuring and reporting the quality, performance, and reliability of Internet data delivery. The metrics include connectivity, one-way delay and loss, round-trip delay and loss, delay variation, loss patterns, packet reordering, bulk transport capacity, and link bandwidth capacity.</t>

<t>These metrics are designed for use by network operators and their customers, and they provide unbiased quantitative measures of performance. The IPPM metrics have been developed inside an active measurement context, that is, the devices used to measure the metrics produce their own traffic. However, most of the metrics can be used inside a passive context as well. At the time of this writing, there is no work planned in the area of passive measurement.</t>

<t>As a property, individual IPPM performance and reliability metrics need to be well defined and concrete: thus, implementable. Furthermore, the methodology used to implement a metric needs to be repeatable with consistent measurements.</t>

<t>IPPMs have been adopted by different organizations, e.g., the Metro Ethernet Forum.</t>

<t>Note that this document does not aim to cover OAM technologies on the
data-path and, as such, the discussion of IPPM-based active versus passive
monitoring as well as the data plane measurement and its diagnostics is rather
incomplete. For a detailed overview and discussion of IETF OAM standards and
IPPM measurement mechanisms, the reader is referred to the documents listed at
the end of <xref target="relwork"/> ("Related Work") but especially to <xref target="OAM-OVERVIEW" />.</t>

<t>The following are essential IPPM documents:</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t><xref target="RFC2330">"Framework for IP Performance Metrics"</xref> defines a general framework for particular metrics developed by the IPPM working group, and it defines the fundamental concepts of 'metric' and 'measurement methodology'. It also discusses the issue of measurement uncertainties and errors as well as introduces the notion of empirically defined metrics and how metrics can be composed.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC2679">"A One-way Delay Metric for IPPM"</xref> defines a metric for the one-way delay of packets across Internet paths. It builds on notions introduced in the IPPM Framework document.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC2681">"A Round-trip Delay Metric for IPPM"</xref> defines a metric for the round-trip delay of packets across network paths and closely follows the corresponding metric for one-way delay.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC3393">"IP Packet Delay Variation Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)"</xref> refers to a metric for variation in the delay of packets across network paths and is based on the difference in the one-way-delay of selected packets called "IP Packet Delay Variation (ipdv)".</t>

<t><xref target="RFC2680">"A One-way Packet Loss Metric for IPPM"</xref> defines a metric for one-way packet loss across Internet paths.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC5560">"A One-Way Packet Duplication Metric"</xref> defines a metric for the case where multiple copies of a packet are received, and it discusses methods to summarize the results of streams.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC4737">"Packet Reordering Metrics"</xref> defines metrics to evaluate whether a network has maintained packet order on a packet-by-packet basis and discusses the measurement issues, including the context information required for all metrics.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC2678">"IPPM Metrics for Measuring Connectivity"</xref> defines a series of metrics for connectivity between a pair of Internet hosts.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC5835">"Framework for Metric Composition"</xref> describes a detailed framework for composing and aggregating metrics.</t>

<t><xref target="BCP170">"Guidelines for Considering New Performance Metric Development"</xref> describes the framework and process for developing Performance Metrics of protocols and applications transported over IETF-specified protocols.</t>
</list>


<t>To measure these metrics, two protocols and a sampling method have been standardized:</t>

<list style="symbols">

<t><xref target="RFC4656">"A One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP)"</xref> measures unidirectional characteristics such as one-way delay and one-way loss between network devices and enables the interoperability of these measurements. OWAMP is discussed in more detail in <xref target="OAM-OVERVIEW" />.</t>


<t><xref target="RFC5357">"A Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)"</xref> adds round-trip or two-way measurement capabilities to OWAMP. TWAMP is discussed in more detail in <xref target="OAM-OVERVIEW" />.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC3432">"Network performance measurement with periodic streams"</xref> describes a periodic sampling method and relevant metrics for assessing the performance of IP networks, as an alternative to the Poisson sampling method described in <xref target="RFC2330"/>.</t>

<section anchor="radius" title="Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)">

<t><xref target="RFC2865">"Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"</xref> describes a client/server protocol for carrying authentication, authorization, and configuration information between a Network Access Server (NAS), which desires to authenticate its links, and a shared authentication server. The companion document <xref target="RFC2866">"Radius Accounting"</xref> describes a protocol for carrying accounting information between a NAS and a shared accounting server. <xref target="RFC2867"/> adds required new RADIUS accounting attributes and new values designed to support the provision of tunneling in dial-up networks.</t>

<t>The RADIUS protocol is widely used in environments like enterprise networks, where a single administrative authority manages the network and protects the privacy of user information. RADIUS is deployed in the networks of fixed broadband access provider as
well as cellular broadband operators.</t>

<t>RADIUS uses attributes to carry the specific authentication, authorization, information, and configuration details. RADIUS is extensible with a known limitation of a maximum of 255 attribute codes and 253 octets as attribute content length. RADIUS has Vendor-Specific Attributes (VSAs), which have been used both for vendor-specific purposes (as an addition to standardized attributes) as well as to extend the limited attribute code space.</t>

<t>The RADIUS protocol uses a shared secret along with the MD5 hash algorithm to secure passwords <xref target="RFC1321"/>. Based on the known threads, additional protection like IPsec tunnels <xref target="RFC4301"/> are used to further protect the RADIUS traffic. However, building and administering large IPsec-protected networks may become a management burden, especially when the IPsec-protected RADIUS infrastructure should provide inter-provider connectivity. Moving towards TLS-based security solutions <xref target="RFC5246"/> and establishing dynamic trust relationships between RADIUS servers has become a trend. Since the introduction of TCP transport for RADIUS <xref target="RFC6613" />, it became natural to have TLS support for RADIUS. An ongoing work is "Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for RADIUS" <xref target="RFC6614" />.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC2868">"RADIUS Attributes for Tunnel Protocol Support"</xref> defines a number of RADIUS attributes designed to support the compulsory provision of tunneling in dial-up network access. Some applications involve compulsory tunneling, i.e., the tunnel is created without any action from the user and without allowing the user any choice in the matter. In order to provide this functionality, specific RADIUS attributes are needed to carry the tunneling information from the RADIUS server to the tunnel end points. <xref target="RFC3868">"Signalling Connection Control Part User Adaptation Layer (SUA)"</xref> defines the necessary attributes, attribute values, and the required IANA registries.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC3162">"RADIUS and IPv6"</xref> specifies the operation of RADIUS over IPv6 and the RADIUS attributes used to support the IPv6 network access. <xref target="RFC4818">"RADIUS Delegated-IPv6-Prefix Attribute"</xref> describes how to transport delegated IPv6 prefix information over RADIUS.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC4675">"RADIUS Attributes for Virtual LAN and Priority Support"</xref> defines additional attributes for dynamic Virtual LAN assignment and prioritization, for use in provisioning of access to IEEE 802 local area networks usable with RADIUS and diameter.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC5080">"Common Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) Implementation Issues and Suggested Fixes"</xref> describes common issues seen in RADIUS implementations and suggests some fixes. Where applicable, unclear statements and errors in previous RADIUS specifications are clarified. People designing extensions to RADIUS protocol for various deployment cases should get familiar with "RADIUS Design Guidelines" <xref target="RFC6158"/> in order to avoid, e.g., known interoperability challenges.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC5090">"RADIUS Extension for Digest Authentication"</xref> defines an extension to the RADIUS protocol to enable support of Digest Authentication, for use with HTTP-style protocols like the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and HTTP.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC5580">"Carrying Location Objects in RADIUS and DIAMETER"</xref> describes procedures for conveying access-network ownership and location information based on civic and geospatial location formats in RADIUS and diameter.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC5607">"Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) Authorization for Network Access Server (NAS) Management"</xref> specifies required RADIUS attributes and their values for authorizing a management access to a NAS. Both local and remote management are supported, with access rights and management privileges. Specific provisions are made for remote management via Framed Management protocols, such as SNMP and NETCONF, and for management access over a secure transport protocol.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC3579">"RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service) Support For Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)"</xref> describes how to use RADIUS to convey an EAP <xref target="RFC3748"/> payload between the authenticator and the EAP server using RADIUS. RFC 3579 is widely implemented, for example, in WLAN and 802.1 X environments. <xref target="RFC3580">"IEEE 802.1X Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) Usage Guidelines"</xref> describes how to use RADIUS with IEEE 802.1X authenticators. In the context of 802.1X and EAP-based authentication, the VSAs described in <xref target="RFC2458"/> have been widely accepted by the industry. <xref target="RFC2869">"RADIUS Extensions"</xref> is another important RFC related to EAP use. RFC 2869 describes additional attributes for carrying AAA information between a NAS and a shared accounting server using RADIUS. It also defines attributes to encapsulate EAP message payload.</t>

<t>There are different MIB modules defined for multiple purposes to use with RADIUS (see Sections <xref target="secaaa" format="counter"/> and <xref target="secsec" format="counter"/>).</t>

</section> <!-- RADIUS -->

<section anchor="diameter" title="Diameter Base Protocol (Diameter)">

<t>Diameter <xref target="RFC3588"/> provides an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) framework for applications such as network access or IP mobility. Diameter is also intended to work in local AAA and in roaming scenarios. Diameter provides an upgrade path for RADIUS but is not directly backwards compatible.</t>

<t>Diameter is designed to resolve a number of known problems with RADIUS. Diameter supports server failover, reliable transport over TCP and SCTP, well-documented functions for proxy, redirect and relay agent functions, server-initiated messages, auditability, and capability negotiation. Diameter also provides a larger attribute space for Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs) and identifiers than RADIUS. Diameter features make it especially appropriate for environments, where the providers of services are in different administrative domains than the maintainer (protector) of confidential user information.</t>

<t>Other notable differences to RADIUS are as follows:</t>

<list style="symbols">
  <t>Network and Transport Layer Security (IPsec or TLS),</t>
  <t>Stateful and stateless models,</t>
  <t>Dynamic discovery of peers (using DNS Service Record (SRV) and Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR)),</t>
  <t>Concept of an application that describes how a specific set of commands and Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs) are treated by diameter nodes. Each application has an IANA-assigned unique identifier,</t>
  <t>Support of application layer acknowledgements, failover methods and state machines,</t>
  <t>Basic support for user-sessions and accounting,</t>
  <t>Better roaming support,</t>
  <t>Error notification, and</t>
  <t>Easy extensibility.</t>
</list>

<t>The Diameter protocol is designed to be extensible to support, e.g., proxies, brokers, mobility and roaming, Network Access Servers (NASREQ), and Accounting and Resource Management. Diameter applications extend the Diameter base protocol by adding new commands and/or attributes. Each application is defined by a unique IANA-assigned application identifier and can add new command codes and/or new mandatory AVPs.</t>

<t>The Diameter application identifier space has been divided into Standards Track and 'First Come First Served' vendor-specific applications. The following are examples of Diameter applications published at IETF:</t>

<list style="symbols">
  <t>Diameter Base Protocol Application <xref target="RFC3588"/>: Required support from all Diameter implementations.</t>

      <t>Diameter Base Accounting Application <xref target="RFC3588"/>: A Diameter application using an accounting protocol based on a server-directed model with capabilities for real-time delivery of accounting information.</t>

<t>Diameter Mobile IPv4 Application <xref target="RFC4004"/>: A Diameter application that allows a Diameter server to authenticate, authorize, and collect accounting information for Mobile IPv4 services rendered to a mobile node.</t>

<t>Diameter Network Access Server Application (NASREQ, <xref target="RFC4005"/>): A Diameter application used for AAA services in the NAS environment.</t>

<t>Diameter Extensible Authentication Protocol Application <xref target="RFC4072"/>: A Diameter application that carries EAP packets between a NAS and a back-end authentication server.</t>

<t>Diameter Credit-Control Application <xref target="RFC4006"/>: A Diameter application that can be used to implement real-time credit-control for a variety of end-user services such as network access, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) services, messaging services, and download services.</t>

<t>Diameter Session Initiation Protocol Application <xref target="RFC4740"/>: A Diameter application designed to be used in conjunction with SIP and provides a Diameter client co-located with a SIP server, with the ability to request the authentication of users and authorization of SIP resources usage from a Diameter server.</t>

<t>Diameter Quality-of-Service Application <xref target="RFC5866"/>: A Diameter application allowing network elements to interact with Diameter servers when allocating QoS resources in the network.</t>

<t>Diameter Mobile IPv6 IKE (MIP6I) Application <xref target="RFC5778"/>: A Diameter application that enables the interaction between a Mobile IP home agent and a Diameter server and is used when the mobile node is authenticated and authorized using IKEv2 <xref target="RFC5996"/>.</t>

<t>Diameter Mobile IPv6 Auth (MIP6A) Application <xref target="RFC5778"/>: A Diameter application that enables the interaction between a Mobile IP home agent and a Diameter server and is used when the mobile node is authenticated and authorized using the Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol <xref target="RFC4285"/>.</t>

</list>

<t>The large majority of Diameter applications are vendor-specific and mainly used in various SDOs outside the IETF. One example SDO using diameter extensively is 3GPP (e.g., 3GPP 'IP Multimedia Subsystem' (IMS) uses diameter-based interfaces (e.g., Cx) <xref target="3GPPIMS"/>). Recently, during the standardization of the '3GPP Evolved Packet Core' <xref target="3GPPEPC"/>, diameter was chosen as the only AAA signaling protocol.</t>

<t>One part of diameter's extensibility mechanism is an easy and consistent way of creating new commands for the need of applications. RFC 3588 proposed to define diameter command code allocations with a new RFC. This policy decision caused undesired use and redefinition of existing command codes within SDOs. Diverse RFCs have been published as simple command code allocations for other SDO purposes (see <xref target="RFC3589"/>, <xref target="RFC5224"/>, <xref target="RFC5431"/>, and <xref target="RFC5516"/>). <xref target="RFC5719"/> changed the command code policy and added a range for vendor-specific command codes to be allocated on a 'First Come First Served' basis by IANA.</t>

<t>The implementation and deployment experience of diameter has led to the ongoing development of an update of the base protocol <xref target="DIAMETER" />, which introduces TLS as the preferred security mechanism and deprecates the in-band security negotiation for TLS.</t>

<t>Some Diameter protocol enhancements and clarifications that logically fit better into <xref target="DIAMETER" />, are also needed on the existing deployments based on RFC 3588. Therefore, protocol extensions specifically usable in large inter-provider roaming network scenarios are made available for RFC 3588. Two currently existing specifications are mentioned below:</t>


<list style="symbols">

<t>"Clarifications on the Routing of Diameter Requests Based on the Username and the Realm" <xref target="RFC5729"/> defines the behavior required for Diameter agents to route requests when the User-Name AVP contains a NAI formatted with multiple realms. These multi-realm Network Access Identifiers are used in order to force the routing of request messages through a predefined list of mediating realms.</t>

<t>"Diameter Straightforward-Naming Authority Pointer (S-NAPTR) Usage" <xref target="RFC6408"/> describes an improved DNS-based dynamic Diameter agent discovery mechanism without having to do diameter capability exchange beforehand with a number of agents.</t>

</list>

<t>There have been a growing number of Diameter Framework documents from the IETF that basically are just a collection of AVPs for a specific purpose or a system architecture with semantic AVP descriptions and a logic for "imaginary" applications. From a standardization point of view, this practice allows the development of larger system architecture documents that do not need to reference AVPs or application logic outside the IETF. Below are examples of a few recent AVP and Framework documents:</t>

<list style="symbols">
  <t>"Diameter Mobile IPv6: Support for Network Access Server to Diameter Server Interaction" <xref target="RFC5447"/> describes the bootstrapping of the Mobile IPv6 framework and the support of interworking with existing AAA infrastructures by using the diameter NAS-to-home-AAA server interface.</t>

  <t>"Traffic Classification and Quality of Service (QoS) Attributes for Diameter" <xref target="RFC5777"/> defines a number of Diameter AVPs for traffic classification with actions for filtering and QoS treatment.</t>

  <t>"Diameter Proxy Mobile IPv6: Mobile Access Gateway and Local Mobility Anchor Interaction with Diameter Server" <xref target="RFC5779"/> defines AAA interactions between Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) entities (MAG and LMA) and a AAA server within a PMIPv6 Domain.</t>

<section anchor="capwap" title="Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP)">

<t>Wireless LAN (WLAN) product architectures have evolved from single autonomous Access Points to systems consisting of a centralized Access Controller (AC) and Wireless Termination Points (WTPs). The general goal of centralized control architectures is to move access control, including user authentication and authorization, mobility management, and radio management from the single access point to a centralized controller, where an Access Point pulls the information from the AC.</t>
 
<t>Based on "Architecture Taxonomy for Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP)" <xref target="RFC4118"/>, the CAPWAP working group developed the CAPWAP protocol <xref target="RFC5415"/> to facilitate control, management, and provisioning of WTPs specifying the services, functions, and resources relating to 802.11 WLAN Termination Points in order to allow for interoperable implementations of WTPs and ACs. The protocol defines the CAPWAP control plane, including the primitives to control data access. The protocol document also specifies how configuration management of WTPs can be done and defines CAPWAP operations responsible for debugging, gathering statistics, logging, and managing firmware as well as discusses operational and transport considerations.</t>

<t>The CAPWAP protocol is prepared to be independent of Layer 2 technologies, and meets the objectives in "Objectives for Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP)" <xref target="RFC4564"/>. Separate binding extensions enable the use with additional wireless technologies. <xref target="RFC5416"/> defines the CAPWAP Protocol Binding for IEEE 802.11.</t>

<t>CAPWAP Control messages, and optionally CAPWAP Data messages, are secured using DTLS <xref target="RFC6347"/>. DTLS is used as a tightly integrated, secure wrapper for the CAPWAP protocol.</t>

<t>For information on MIB modules related to CAPWAP, see <xref target="seccm"/>.</t>

<section anchor="ancp" title="Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP)">

<t>The Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) <xref target="RFC6320"/> realizes a control plane between a service-oriented Layer 3 edge device, the NAS and a Layer 2 Access Node (AN), e.g., Digital Subscriber Line Access Module (DSLAM). As such, ANCP operates in a multi-service reference architecture and communicates QoS-, service-, and subscriber-related configuration and operation information between a NAS and an AN.</t>

<t>The main goal of this protocol is to configure and manage access equipment and allow them to report information to the NAS in order to enable and optimize configuration.</t>

<t>The framework and requirements for an AN control mechanism and the use cases for ANCP are documented in <xref target="RFC5851"/>.</t>

<t>ANCP offers authentication and authorization between AN and NAS nodes and provides replay protection and data-origin authentication. The ANCP solution is also robust against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Furthermore, the ANCP solution is recommended to offer confidentiality protection. Security Threats and Security Requirements for ANCP are discussed in <xref target="RFC5713"/>.</t>

</section> <!-- Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP)-->


<section anchor="acap" title="Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP)">

<t>The Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) <xref target="RFC2244"/> is designed to support remote storage and access of program option, configuration, and preference information. The datastore model is designed to allow a client relatively simple access to interesting data, to allow new information to be easily added without server reconfiguration, and to promote the use of both standardized data and custom or proprietary data. Key features include "inheritance", which can be used to manage default values for configuration settings and access control lists that allow interesting personal information to be shared and group information to be restricted.</t>

<t>ACAP's primary purpose is to allow applications access to their configuration data from multiple network-connected computers. Users can then use any network-connected computer, run any ACAP-enabled application, and have access to their own configuration data. To enable wide usage client simplicity has been preferred to server or protocol simplicity whenever reasonable.</t>

<t>The ACAP 'authenticate' command uses Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) <xref target="RFC4422"/> to provide basic authentication, authorization, integrity, and privacy services. All ACAP implementations are required to implement the CRAM-MD5 (Challenge-Response Authentication Mechanism) <xref target="RFC2195"/> for authentication, which can be disabled based on the site security policy.</t>

</section> <!-- ACAP -->

<section anchor="xcap" title="XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP)">
<t>The Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) <xref target="RFC4825"/> has been designed for and is commonly used with SIP-based solutions, in particular, for instant messages, presence, and SIP conferences. XCAP is a protocol that allows a client to read, write, and modify application configuration data stored in XML format on a server, where the main functionality is provided by so-called "XCAP Application Usages".</t>

<t>XCAP is a protocol that can be used to manipulate per-user data. XCAP is a set of conventions for mapping XML documents and document components into HTTP URIs, rules for how the modification of one resource affects another, data validation constraints, and authorization policies associated with access to those resources. Because of this structure, normal HTTP primitives can be used to manipulate the data. Like ACAP, XCAP supports the configuration needs for a multiplicity of applications.</t>

<t>All XCAP servers are required to implement HTTP Digest Authentication <xref target="RFC2617"/>. Furthermore, XCAP servers are required to implement HTTP over TLS (HTTPS) <xref target="RFC2818"/>. It is recommended that administrators use an HTTPS URI as the XCAP root URI, so that the digest client authentication occurs over TLS.</t>

<t>The following list summarizes important XCAP application usages:</t>

<list style="symbols">

<t>XCAP server capabilities <xref target="RFC4825"/> can be read by clients to determine which extensions, application usages, or namespaces a server supports.</t>

<t>A resource lists application is any application that needs access to a list of resources, identified by a URI, to which operations, such as subscriptions, can be applied  <xref target="RFC4826"/>.</t>

<t>A Resource List Server (RLS) Services application is a SIP application, where a server receives SIP SUBSCRIBE requests for resources and generates subscriptions towards the resource list  <xref target="RFC4826"/>.</t>

<t>A Presence Rules application uses authorization policies, also known as authorization rules, to specify what presence information can be given to which watchers, and when  <xref target="RFC4827"/>.</t>

<t>A 'pidf-manipulation' application defines how XCAP is used to manipulate the contents of PIDF-based presence documents <xref target="RFC4827"/>.</t>

<section anchor="dms" title="Network Management Data Models">

<t>This section provides two complementary overviews for the network management data models standardized at IETF. The first subsection focuses on a broader view of models classified into categories such as generic and infrastructure data models as well as data models matched to different layers.
The second subsection is structured following the management application view and focuses mainly on the data models for the network management tasks fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security management (see <xref target="FCAPS"/>).</t>

<t>Note that the IETF does not use the FCAPS view as an organizing principle for its data models. However, the FCAPS view is used widely outside of the IETF for the realization of management tasks and applications. <xref target="f-dms"/> aims to address the FCAPS view to enable people outside of the IETF to understand the relevant data models in the IETF.</t>

<t>The different data models covered in this section are MIB modules, IPFIX Information Elements, Syslog Structured Data Elements, and YANG modules. There are many technology-specific IETF data models, such as transmission and protocol MIBs, which are not mentioned in this document and can be found at <xref target="RFCSEARCH"/>.</t>

<t>This section gives an overview of management data models that have reached Draft or Proposed Standard status at the IETF. In exceptional cases, important Informational RFCs are referenced. The advancement process for management data models beyond Proposed Standard status, has been defined in <xref target="BCP027"/> with a more pragmatic approach and special considerations on data model specification interoperability. However, most IETF management data models never advanced beyond Proposed Standard.</t>

<section anchor="i-dms" title="IETF Network Management Data Models">

<t>The data models defined by the IETF can be broadly classified into the following categories depicted in Figure 1.</t>

<section anchor="genDM" title="Generic Infrastructure Data Models">

<t>Generic infrastructure data models provide core abstractions that many other data models are built upon. The most important example is the interfaces data model defined in the IF-MIB <xref target="RFC2863"/>. It provides the basic notion of network interfaces and allows expressing stacking/layering relationships between interfaces. The interfaces data model also provides basic monitoring objects that are widely used for performance and fault management.</t>
  
<t>The second important infrastructure data model is defined in the
Entity MIB <xref target="RFC4133"/>. It exports the containment hierarchy of the physical entities (slots, modules, ports) that make up a networking device and, as such, it is a key data model for inventory management. Physical entities can have pointers to other data models that provide more specific information about them (e.g., physical ports usually point to the related network interface). Entity MIB extensions exist for physical sensors such as temperature sensors embedded on line cards or sensors that report fan rotation speeds <xref target="RFC3433"/>. The Entity State MIB <xref target="RFC4268" /> models states and alarms of physical entities. Some vendors have extended the basic Entity MIB with several proprietary data models.</t>

<section anchor="llDM" title="Link-Layer Data Models">

<t>A number of data models exist in the form of MIB modules covering the link
layers IP runs over, such as Asymmetric Bit-Rate DSL (ADSL) <xref
target="RFC4706"/>, Very high bit-rate Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL) <xref
target="RFC5650"/>, GMPLS <xref target="RFC4803"/>, ISDN <xref
target="RFC2127"/>, ATM <xref target="RFC2515"/> <xref target="RFC3606"/>,
Cable Modems <xref target="RFC4546"/>, or Ethernet <xref target="RFC4188"/>
<xref target="RFC4318"/> <xref target="RFC4363"/>. These so-called transmission
data models typically extend the generic network interfaces data model with
interface type specific information. Most of the link-layer data models focus
on monitoring capabilities that can be used for performance and fault
management functions and, to some lesser extent, for accounting and security
management functions. Meanwhile, the IEEE has taken over the responsibility to
maintain and further develop data models for the IEEE 802 family of protocols
<xref target="RFC4663"/>. The cable modem industry consortium DOCSIS is working
with the IETF to publish data models for cable modem networks as IETF Standards
Track specifications.</t>

<section anchor="nlDM" title="Network-Layer Data Models">

<t>There are data models in the form of MIB modules covering IP/ICMP <xref target="RFC4293"/> <xref target="RFC4292"/> network protocols and their extensions (e.g., Mobile IP), the core protocols of the Internet. In addition, there are data models covering popular unicast routing protocols (OSPF <xref target="RFC4750"/>, IS-IS <xref target="RFC4444"/>, BGP-4 <xref target="RFC4273"/>) and multicast routing protocols (PIM <xref target="RFC5060"/>).</t>

<t>Detailed models also exist for performance measurements in the form of IP Performance Metrics <xref target="RFC2330"/> (see <xref target="ippm"/>).</t>

<section anchor="tlDM" title="Transport-Layer Data Models">

<t>There are data models for the transport protocols TCP <xref target="RFC4022"/>, UDP <xref target="RFC4113"/>, and SCTP <xref target="RFC3873"/>. For TCP, a data model providing extended statistics is defined in <xref target="RFC4898"/>.</t>


</section> <!-- Transport Layer Data Models -->

<section anchor="alDM" title="Application-Layer Data Models">

<t>Some data models have been developed for specific application protocols (e.g., SIP <xref target="RFC4780"/>). In addition, there are data models that provide a generic infrastructure for instrumenting applications in order to obtain data useful primarily for performance management and fault management <xref target="RFC2287"/> <xref target="RFC2564"/>. In general, however, generic application MIB modules have been less successful in gaining widespread deployment.</t>

</section> <!-- Application Layer Data Models -->

<section anchor="infDM" title="Network Management Infrastructure Data Models">

<t>A number of data models are concerned with the network management system itself. This includes, in addition to a set of SNMP MIB modules for monitoring and configuring SNMP itself <xref target="RFC3410"/>, some MIB modules providing generic functions such as the calculation of expressions over MIB objects, generic functions for thresholding and event generation, event notification logging functions, and data models to represent alarms <xref target="RFC2981"/> <xref target="RFC2982"/> <xref target="RFC3014"/> <xref target="RFC3877"/>. In addition, there are data models that allow the execution of basic reachability and path discovery tests <xref target="RFC4560"/>. Another collection of MIB modules provides remote monitoring functions, ranging from the data link layer up to the application layer. This is known as the "RMON family of MIB modules" <xref target="RFC3577"/>.</t>

<t>The IPFIX Protocol <xref target="RFC5101"/> (<xref target="ipfix"/>) is used to export information about network flows collected at so-called Observation Points (typically, a network interface). The IEs <xref target="RFC5102"/> carried in IPFIX cover the majority
of the network and transport layer header fields and a few link-layer-specific fields. 

Work is underway to further extend the standardized information that can be carried in IPFIX.</t>

<t>The Syslog Protocol document <xref target="RFC5424"/> (<xref target="syslog"/>) defines an initial set of Structured Data Elements (SDEs) that relate to content time quality, content origin, and meta-information about the message, such as language.

<section anchor="f-dms" title="Network Management Data Models - FCAPS View">

<t>This subsection follows the management application view and aims to match the data models to network management tasks for fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security management (<xref target="FCAPS"/>). As OAM is a general term that refers to a toolset, which can be used for fault detection, isolation, and performance measurement, aspects of FCAPS in the context of the data path, such as fault and performance management, are also discussed in <xref target="OAM-OVERVIEW" >"An Overview of Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Mechanisms"</xref>.</t>

<t>Some of the data models do not fit into one single FCAPS category per design
but span multiple areas. For example, there are many technology-specific IETF
data models, such as transmission and protocol MIBs, which cover multiple FCAPS
categories, and therefore are not mentioned in this subsection and can be found
at <xref target="RFCSEARCH"/>.</t> 

<section anchor="secfm" title="Fault Management">

<t>Fault management encloses a set of functions to detect, isolate, notify, and correct faults encountered in a network as well as to maintain and examine error logs. The data models below can be utilized to realize a fault management application.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC3418"/>, part of SNMPv3 standard <xref target="STD62"/>, is a MIB module containing objects in the system group that are often polled to determine if a device is still operating, and sysUpTime can be used to detect if the network management portion of the system has restarted and counters have been re-initialized.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC3413"/>, part of SNMPv3 standard <xref target="STD62"/>, is a MIB module including objects designed for managing notifications, including tables for addressing, retry parameters, security, lists of targets for notifications, and user customization filters.</t>

<t>The Interfaces Group MIB <xref target="RFC2863"/> builds on the old standard for MIB II <xref target="STD17"/> and is used as a primary MIB module for managing and monitoring the status of network interfaces. The Interfaces Group MIB defines a generic set of managed objects for network interfaces, and it provides the infrastructure for additional managed objects specific to particular types of network interfaces, such as Ethernet.</t>  

<t><xref target="RFC4560"/> defines a MIB module for performing ping, traceroute, and lookup operations at a host. For troubleshooting purposes, it is useful to be able to initiate and retrieve the results of ping or traceroute operations when they are performed at a remote host.</t> 
 
<t>The RMON (Remote Network Monitoring) MIB <xref target="STD59"/> can be configured to recognize conditions on existing MIB variables (most notably error conditions) and continuously check for them. When one of these conditions occurs, the event may be logged, and management stations may be notified in a number of ways (for further discussion on RMON, see <xref target="PerfMgmt"/>).</t>

<t>DISMAN-EVENT-MIB in <xref target="RFC2981"/> and DISMAN-EXPRESSION-MIB in <xref target="RFC2982"/> provide a superset of the capabilities of the RMON alarm and event groups. These modules provide mechanisms for thresholding and reporting anomalous events to management applications.</t>

<t>The Alarm MIB in <xref target="RFC3877"/> and the Alarm Reporting Control MIB in <xref target="RFC3878"/> specify mechanisms for expressing state transition models for persistent problem states. Alarm MIB defines the following:
<list style="symbols" >
<t>a mechanism for expressing state transition models for persistent problem states,</t>
<t>a mechanism to correlate a notification with subsequent state transition notifications about the same entity/object, and</t>
<t> a generic alarm reporting mechanism (extends ITU-T work on X.733 <xref target="ITU-X733"/>).
</t></list>
</t>
<t>In particular, <xref target="RFC3878"/> defines objects for controlling the reporting of alarm conditions and extends ITU-T work on M.3100 Amendment 3 <xref target="ITU-M3100"/>.</t>

<t>Other MIB modules that may be applied to fault management with SNMP include:</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB <xref target="RFC3014"/> describes managed objects used for logging SNMP Notifications.</t>
<t>ENTITY-STATE-MIB <xref target="RFC4268"/> describes extensions to the Entity MIB to provide information about the state of physical entities.</t>
<t>ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB <xref target="RFC3433"/> describes managed objects for extending the Entity MIB to provide generalized access to information related to physical sensors, which are often found in networking equipment (such as chassis temperature, fan RPM, power supply voltage).</t>
</list>

<t>The Syslog protocol document <xref target="RFC5424"/> defines an initial set of SDEs that relate to content time quality, content origin, and meta-information about the message, such as language. Proprietary SDEs can be used to supplement the IETF-defined SDEs.</t>

<t>The IETF has standardized MIB Textual-Conventions for facility and severity labels and codes to encourage consistency between syslog and MIB representations of these event properties <xref target="RFC5427"/>. The intent is that these textual conventions will be imported and used in MIB modules that would otherwise define their own representations.</t>

<t>An IPFIX MIB module <xref target="RFC5815"/> has been defined for monitoring IPFIX Meters, Exporters, and Collectors (see <xref target="ipfix"/>). The ongoing work on the PSAMP MIB module extends the IPFIX MIB modules by managed objects for monitoring PSAMP implementations <xref target="PSAMP-MIB" />.</t>

<t>The NETCONF working group defined the data model necessary to monitor the NETCONF protocol <xref target="RFC6022"/> with the modeling language YANG. The monitoring data model includes information about NETCONF datastores, sessions, locks, and statistics, which facilitate the management of a NETCONF server. The NETCONF monitoring document also defines methods for NETCONF clients to discover the data models supported by a NETCONF server and defines the operation &lt;get-schema&gt; to retrieve them.</t>

</section> <!-- Fault Management -->

<section anchor="seccm" title="Configuration Management">

<t>Configuration management focuses on establishing and maintaining consistency of a system and defines the functionality to configure 
its functional and physical attributes as well as operational information throughout its life. Configuration management includes configuration of network devices, inventory management, and software management. The data models below can be used to utilize configuration management.</t>

<t>MIB modules for monitoring of network configuration (e.g., for physical and logical network topologies) already exist and provide some of the desired capabilities. New MIB modules might be developed for the target functionality to allow operators to monitor and modify the operational parameters, such as timer granularity, event reporting thresholds, target addresses, etc.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC3418"/>, part of <xref target="STD62"/>, contains objects in the system group useful, e.g., for identifying the type of device and the location of the device, the person responsible for the device. The SNMPv3 standard <xref target="STD62"/> furthermore includes objects designed for configuring principals, access control rules, notification destinations, and for configuring proxy-forwarding SNMP agents, which can be used to forward messages through firewalls and NAT devices.</t>

<t>The Entity MIB <xref target="RFC4133"/> supports mainly inventory management and is used for managing multiple logical and physical entities matched to a single SNMP agent. This module provides a useful mechanism for identifying the entities comprising a system and defines event notifications for configuration changes that may be useful to management applications.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC3165"/> defines a set of managed objects that enable the delegation of management scripts to distributed managers.</t>

<t>For configuring IPFIX and PSAMP devices, the IPFIX working group developed the IPFIX Configuration Data Model <xref target="CONF-MODEL" />, by using the YANG modeling language and in close collaboration with the NETMOD working group (see <xref target="yangdml"/>). The model specifies the necessary data for configuring and monitoring Selection Processes, caches, Exporting Processes, and Collecting Processes of IPFIX- and PSAMP-compliant monitoring devices.</t>

<t>At the time of this writing, the NETMOD working group is developing core system and interface models in YANG.</t>


<t>The CAPWAP protocol exchanges message elements using the Type-Length-Value (TLV) format. The base TLVs are specified in <xref target="RFC5415"/>, while the TLVs for IEEE 802.11 are specified in <xref target="RFC5416"/>. The CAPWAP Base MIB <xref target="RFC5833"/> specifies managed objects for the modeling the CAPWAP protocol and provides configuration and WTP status-monitoring aspects of CAPWAP, where the CAPWAP Binding MIB <xref target="RFC5834"/> defines managed objects for the modeling of the CAPWAP protocol for IEEE 802.11 wireless binding. 
<vspace blankLines="0"/>
Note: RFC 5833 and RFC 5834 have been published as Informational RFCs to provide the basis for future work on a SNMP management of the CAPWAP protocol.</t>

<section anchor="secaaa" title="Accounting Management">

<t>Accounting management collects usage information of network resources. Note that the IETF does not define any mechanisms related to billing and charging. Many technology-specific MIBs (link layer, network layer, transport layer, or application layer) contain counters but are not primarily targeted for accounting and, therefore, are not included in this section.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC4670">"RADIUS Accounting Client MIB for IPv6"</xref> defines RADIUS Accounting Client MIB objects that support version-neutral IP addressing formats.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC4671">"RADIUS Accounting Server MIB for IPv6"</xref> defines RADIUS Accounting Server MIB objects that support version-neutral IP addressing formats.</t>

<t>IPFIX/PSAMP Information Elements:</t>

<t>As expressed in <xref target="ipfix"/>, the IPFIX Architecture <xref target="RFC5470"/> defines components involved in IP flow measurement and reporting of information on IP flows. As such, IPFIX records provide fine-grained measurement data for flexible and detailed usage reporting and enable usage-based accounting.</t>

<t>The IPFIX Information Elements (IEs) have been initially defined in the IPFIX Information Model <xref target="RFC5102"/> and registered with IANA <xref target="IANA-IPFIX"/>. The IPFIX IEs are composed of two types:</t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>IEs related to identification of IP flows such as header information, derived packet properties, IGP and BGP next-hop IP address, BGP AS, etc., and</t>
<t>IEs related to counter and timestamps, such as per-flow counters (e.g., octet count, packet count), flow start times, flow end times, and flow duration, etc.</t>
</list>

<t>The Information Elements specified in the IPFIX Information Model <xref target="RFC5102"/> are used by the PSAMP protocol where applicable. PSAMP Parameters defined in the PSAMP protocol specification are registered at <xref target="IANA-PSAMP"/>. An additional set of PSAMP Information Elements for reporting packet information with the IPFIX/PSAMP protocol such as Sampling-related IEs are specified in the PSAMP Information Model <xref target="RFC5477"/>. These IEs fulfill the requirements on reporting of different sampling and filtering techniques specified in <xref target="RFC5475"/>.</t>

</section> <!-- Accounting Management -->

<section anchor="PerfMgmt" title="Performance Management">

<t>Performance management covers a set of functions that evaluate and report the performance of network elements and the network, with the goal to maintain the overall network performance at a defined level. Performance management functionality includes monitoring and measurement of network performance parameters, gathering statistical information, maintaining and examining activity logs. The data models below can be used for performance management tasks.</t>

<t>The RMON (Remote Network Monitoring) MIB <xref target="STD59"/> defines objects for collecting data related to network performance and traffic from remote monitoring devices. An organization may employ many remote monitoring probes, one per network segment, to monitor its network. These devices may be used by a network service provider to access a
(distant) client network.
Most of the objects in the RMON MIB module are suitable for the monitoring of any type of network, while some of them are specific to the monitoring of Ethernet networks.</t>

<t>RMON allows a probe to be configured to perform diagnostics and to collect network statistics continuously, even when communication with the management station may not be possible or efficient. The alarm group periodically takes statistical samples from variables in the probe and compares them to previously configured thresholds. If the monitored variable crosses a threshold, an event is generated.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC3577">"Introduction to the Remote Monitoring (RMON) Family of MIB Modules"</xref> describes the documents associated with the RMON Framework and how they relate to each other.</t>

<t>The RMON-2 MIB <xref target="RFC4502"/> extends RMON by providing RMON analysis up to the application layer and defines performance data to monitor. The SMON MIB <xref target="RFC2613"/> extends RMON by providing RMON analysis for switched networks.</t>

<t>"Remote Monitoring MIB Extensions for High Capacity Alarms" <xref target="RFC3434"/> describes managed objects for extending the alarm thresholding capabilities found in the RMON MIB and provides similar threshold monitoring of objects based on the Counter64 data type.</t>

<t>"Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base for High Capacity Networks" <xref target="RFC3273"/> defines objects for managing RMON devices for use on high-speed networks.</t>

<t>"Remote Monitoring MIB Extensions for Interface Parameters Monitoring" <xref target="RFC3144"/> describes an extension to the RMON MIB with a method of sorting the interfaces of a monitored device according to values of parameters specific to this interface.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC4710"/> describes Real-Time Application Quality of Service Monitoring (RAQMON), which is part of the RMON protocol family. RAQMON supports end-to-end QoS monitoring for multiple concurrent applications and does not relate to a specific application transport. RAQMON is scalable and works well with encrypted payload and signaling. RAQMON uses TCP to transport RAQMON PDUs.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC4711"/> proposes an extension to the Remote Monitoring MIB <xref target="STD59"/> and describes managed objects used for RAQMON. <xref target="RFC4712"/> specifies two transport mappings for the RAQMON information model using TCP as a native transport and SNMP to carry the RAQMON information from a RAQMON Data Source (RDS) to a RAQMON Report Collector (RRC).</t>

<t>"Application Performance Measurement MIB" <xref target="RFC3729"/> uses the architecture created in the RMON MIB and defines objects by providing measurement and analysis of the application performance as experienced by end-users. <xref target="RFC3729"/> enables the measurement of the quality of service delivered to end-users by applications.</t>

<t>"Transport Performance Metrics MIB" <xref target="RFC4150"/> describes managed objects used for monitoring selectable Performance Metrics and statistics derived from the monitoring of network packets and sub-application level transactions. The metrics can be defined through reference to existing IETF, ITU, and other SDOs' documents.</t>

<t>The IPPM working group has defined <xref target="RFC4148">"IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Metrics Registry"</xref>. Note that with the publication of <xref target="RFC6248"/>, <xref target="RFC4148"/> and the corresponding IANA registry for IPPM metrics have been declared Obsolete and shouldn't be used.</t> 

<t>The IPPM working group defined the "Information Model and XML Data Model for Traceroute Measurements" <xref target="RFC5388"/>, which defines a common information model dividing the IEs into two semantically separated groups (configuration elements and results elements) with an additional element to relate configuration elements and results elements by means of a common unique identifier. Based on the information model, an XML data model is provided to store the results of traceroute measurements.</t>

<t>"Session Initiation Protocol Event Package for Voice Quality Reporting" <xref target="RFC6035"/> defines a SIP event package that enables the collection and reporting of metrics that measure the quality for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) sessions.</t>

</section> <!-- Performance Management -->

<section anchor="secsec" title="Security Management">

<t>Security management provides the set of functions to protect the network and system from unauthorized access and includes functions such as creating, deleting, and controlling security services and mechanisms, key management, reporting security-relevant events, and authorizing user access and privileges. Based on their support for authentication and authorization, RADIUS and diameter are seen as security management protocols. The data models below can be used to utilize security management.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC3414"/>, part of <xref target="STD62"/>, specifies the procedures for providing SNMPv3 message-level security and includes a MIB module for remotely monitoring and managing the configuration parameters for the USM.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC3415"/>, part of <xref target="STD62"/>, describes the procedures for controlling access to management information in the SNMPv3 architecture and includes a MIB module, which defines managed objects to access portions of an SNMP engine's Local Configuration
Datastore (LCD). As such, this MIB module enables remote management of the configuration parameters of the VACM.</t>

<t>The NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM) <xref target="RFC6536"/> addresses the need for access control mechanisms for the operation and content layers of NETCONF, as defined in <xref target="RFC6241"/>. As such, the NACM proposes standard mechanisms to restrict NETCONF protocol access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations and content within a particular server.</t>

<t>There are numerous MIB modules defined for multiple purposes to use with RADIUS:</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t><xref target="RFC4668">"RADIUS Authentication Client MIB for IPv6"</xref> defines RADIUS Authentication Client MIB objects that support version-neutral IP addressing formats and defines a set of extensions for RADIUS authentication client functions.</t>
<t><xref target="RFC4669">"RADIUS Authentication Server MIB for IPv6"</xref> defines RADIUS Authentication Server MIB objects that support version-neutral IP addressing formats and defines a set of extensions for RADIUS authentication server functions.</t>
<t><xref target="RFC4672">"RADIUS Dynamic Authorization Client MIB"</xref> defines the MIB module for entities implementing the client side of the Dynamic Authorization Extensions to RADIUS <xref target="RFC5176"/>.</t>
<t><xref target="RFC4673">"RADIUS Dynamic Authorization Server MIB"</xref> defines the MIB module for entities implementing the server side of the Dynamic Authorization Extensions to RADIUS <xref target="RFC5176"/>.</t>
</list>

<t>The MIB Module definitions in <xref target="RFC4668"/>, <xref target="RFC4669"/>, <xref target="RFC4672"/>, <xref target="RFC4673"/> are intended to be used only for RADIUS over UDP and do not support RADIUS over TCP. There is also a recommendation that RADIUS clients and servers implementing RADIUS over TCP should not reuse earlier listed MIB modules to perform statistics counting for RADIUS-over-TCP connections.</t>

<t>Currently, there are no standardized MIB modules for diameter applications, which can be considered as a lack on the management side of diameter nodes. </t>

<t>
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification
defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI
reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative
grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual
specifications of each URI scheme.

<t>
   The Internet Standards Process [1] requires that all IETF Standards
   Track specifications must have &quot;multiple, independent, and
   interoperable implementations&quot; before they can be advanced beyond
   Proposed Standard status.  This document specifies the process which
   the IESG will use to determine if a MIB specification document meets
   these requirements.  It also discusses the rationale for this
   process.

<section title="High-Level Classification of Management Protocols and Data Models">

<t>The following subsections aim to guide the reader for the fast selection of the management standard in interest and can be used as a dispatcher to forward to the appropriate chapter. The subsections below classify the protocols on one hand according to high-level criteria such as push versus pull mechanism, and passive versus active monitoring. On the other hand, the protocols are categorized concerning the network management task they address or the data model extensibility they provide. Based on the reader's requirements, a reduced set of standard protocols and associated data models can be selected for further reading.</t> 

<t>As an example, someone outside of IETF typically would look for the TWAMP protocol in the Operations and Management Area working groups as it addresses performance management. However, the protocol TWAMP has been developed by the IPPM working group in the Transport Area.</t>  

<t>Note that not all protocols have been listed in all classification sections. Some of the protocols, especially the protocols with specific focus in <xref target="protocols" /> cannot be clearly classified. Note also that COPS and COPS-PR are not listed in the tables, as COPS-PR is not recommended to use (see <xref target="policy" />).</t> 

<section title="Protocols Classified by Standards Maturity in the IETF">

<t>This section classifies the management protocols according their standard maturity in the IETF. The IETF standard maturity levels Proposed, Draft, or Internet Standard, are defined in <xref target="RFC2026"/> (as amended by <xref target="RFC6410" />). An Internet Standard is characterized by a high degree of technical maturity and by a generally held belief that the specified protocol or service provides significant benefit to the Internet community.</t>

<t>The table below covers the standard maturity of the different protocols listed in this document. Note that only the main protocols (and not their extensions) are noted. An RFC search tool listing the current document status is available at <xref target="RFCSEARCH"/>.</t>

<section title="Passive versus Active Monitoring">

<t>Monitoring can be divided into two categories: passive and active monitoring. Passive monitoring can perform the network traffic monitoring, monitoring of a device, or the accounting of network resource consumption by users. Active monitoring, as used in this document, focuses mainly on active network monitoring and relies on the injection of specific traffic (also called "synthetic traffic"), which is then monitored. The monitoring focus is indicated in the table below as "network", "device", or "accounting".</t> 

<t>This classification excludes non-monitoring protocols, such as configuration protocols: Ad hoc network autoconfiguration, ANCP, and XCAP. Note that some of the active monitoring protocols, in the context of the data path, e.g., ICMP Ping and Traceroute <xref target="RFC1470"/>, Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) <xref target="RFC5880"/>, and PWE3 Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) <xref target="RFC5085"/> are covered in <xref target="OAM-OVERVIEW" />.</t>

<t>The application of SNMP to passive traffic monitoring (e.g., with RMON-MIB) or active monitoring (with IPPM MIB) depends on the MIB modules used. However, the SNMP protocol itself does not have operations, which support active monitoring. NETCONF can be used for passive monitoring, e.g., with the NETCONF Monitoring YANG module <xref target="RFC6022"/> for the monitoring of the NETCONF protocol. CAPWAP monitors the status of a Wireless Termination Point.</t>

<t>RADIUS and diameter are considered passive monitoring protocols as they perform accounting, i.e., counting the number of packets/bytes for a specific user.</t>

<section title="New Work Related to IETF Management Standards">

<section title="Energy Management (EMAN)">

<t>Energy management is becoming an additional requirement for network
management systems due to several factors including the rising and
fluctuating energy costs, the increased awareness of the ecological
impact of operating networks and devices, and government regulation on energy consumption and production.</t>

<t>The basic objective of energy management is operating communication
networks and other equipment with a minimal amount of energy while
still providing sufficient performance to meet service-level objectives.
Today, most networking and network-attached devices neither monitor nor allow controlled energy usage as they are mainly instrumented for functions such as fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security management. These devices are not instrumented to be aware of energy consumption. There are very few means specified in IETF documents for energy management, which includes the areas of power monitoring, energy monitoring, and power state control.</t>

<t>A particular difference between energy management and other management tasks is that in some cases energy consumption of a device is not measured at the device itself but reported by a different place. For example, at a Power over Ethernet (PoE) sourcing device or at a smart power strip, where one device is effectively metering another remote device. This requires a clear definition of the relationship between the reporting devices and identification of remote devices for which monitoring information is provided. Similar considerations will apply to power state control of remote devices, for example, at a PoE sourcing device that switches on and off power at its ports. Another example scenario for energy management is a gateway to low resourced and lossy network devices in wireless a building network. Here the energy management system talks directly to the gateway but not necessarily to other devices in the building network.</t>


<t>At the time of this writing, the EMAN working group is working on the management of energy-aware devices, covered by the following items:

<list style="symbols">

<t>The requirements for energy management, specifying energy management properties
that will allow networks and devices to become energy aware. In addition to energy awareness requirements, the need for control functions will be discussed. Specifically, the need to monitor and control properties of devices that are remote to the reporting device should be discussed.</t>

<t>The energy management framework, which will describe extensions to the current management framework, required for energy management. This includes: power and energy monitoring, power states, power state control, and potential power state transitions. The framework will focus on energy management for IP-based network equipment (routers, switches, PCs, IP cameras, phones and the like).
Particularly, the relationships between reporting devices, remote
devices, and monitoring probes (such as might be used in low-power and lossy networks) need to be elaborated. For the case of a device
reporting on behalf of other devices and controlling those devices, the framework will address the issues of discovery and identification of remote devices.</t>

<t>The Energy-aware Networks and Devices MIB document, for monitoring energy-aware networks and devices, will address devices identification, context information, and potential relationship between reporting devices, remote devices, and monitoring probes.</t>
<t>The Power and Energy Monitoring MIB document will document defining
managed objects for the monitoring of power states and energy consumption/production. The monitoring of power states includes the following: retrieving power states, properties of power states, current power state, power state transitions, and power state statistics. The managed objects will provide means of reporting detailed properties of the actual energy rate (power) and of accumulated energy. Further, they will provide information on electrical power quality.</t>

<t>The Battery MIB document will define managed objects for battery
monitoring, which will provide means of reporting detailed properties
of the actual charge, age, and state of a battery and of battery
statistics.</t>

<t>The applicability statement will describe the variety of applications that can use the energy framework and associated MIB modules. Potential examples are building networks, home energy gateway, etc. Finally, the document will also discuss relationships of the framework to other architectures and frameworks (such as Smart Grid). The applicability statement will explain the relationship between the work in this WG and other existing standards, e.g., from the IEC, ANSI, DMTF, etc. Note that the EMAN WG will be looking into existing standards such as those from the IEC, ANSI, DMTF and others, and reuse existing work as much as possible.</t>
