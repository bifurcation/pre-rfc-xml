   <t>This document describes an experimental use case that employs autonomic
   networking for the monitoring of Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
   The use case is for detecting violations of SLAs in a distributed
   fashion. It strives to optimize and dynamically adapt the autonomic
   deployment of active measurement probes in a way that maximizes the
   likelihood of detecting service-level violations with a given
   resource budget to perform active measurements. This optimization and
   adaptation should be done without any outside guidance or intervention.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>The Internet has been growing dramatically in terms of size,
      capacity, and accessibility in recent years. 
      Communication requirements of distributed services and applications
      running on top of the Internet have become increasingly demanding. 

      Some examples are real-time interactive video or financial trading.  
      Providing such services involves stringent requirements in terms of
      acceptable latency, loss, and jitter.</t>

      <t>Performance requirements lead to the articulation of Service Level Objectives (SLOs) that must be met. 
      Those SLOs are part of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that define a contract between the provider and the consumer of a service. 
      SLOs, in effect, constitute a service-level guarantee that the consumer of the service can expect to receive (and often has to pay for).  
      Likewise, the provider of a service needs to ensure that the service-level guarantee and associated SLOs are met.      
      Some examples of clauses that relate to SLOs can be found in <xref target="RFC7297" />. 
      </t>

      <t>
      Violations of SLOs can be associated with significant financial loss,
      which can by divided into two categories. 
      First, there is the loss that can be incurred by the user of a service when the agreed service levels are not provided.  
      For example, a financial brokerage's stock orders might suffer losses when it is unable to execute stock transactions in a timely manner.  
      An electronic retailer may lose customers when its online presence is perceived by customers as sluggish. 
      An online gaming provider may not be able to provide fair access to online players, resulting in frustrated players who are lost as customers. 
      In each case, the failure of a service provider to meet promised service-level guarantees can have a substantial financial impact on users of the service.     
      Second, there is the loss that is incurred by the provider of a service
      who is unable to meet promised SLOs.  Those losses can take several
      forms, such as penalties for violating the service level agreement and
      even loss of future revenue due to reduced customer satisfaction (which,
      in many cases, is more serious). 
Hence, SLOs are a key concern for the service provider.   
      In order to ensure that SLOs are not being violated, service levels need to be continuously monitored at the network infrastructure layer in order 
      to know, for example, when mitigating actions need to be taken.  
      To that end, service-level measurements must take place.</t>

<t>Network measurements can be performed using active or passive measurement techniques. 
In passive measurements, production traffic is observed, and no monitoring
traffic is created by the measurement process itself.  
That is, network conditions are checked in a non-intrusive way. 
In the context of IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX), several documents were produced that define how to export data associated with flow records, 
i.e., data that is collected as part of passive measurement mechanisms, generally applied against flows of production traffic (e.g., <xref target="RFC7011" />).
In addition, it is possible to collect real data traffic (not just summarized
flow records) with time-stamped packets, possibly sampled
(e.g., per <xref target="RFC5474"/>), 
as a means of measuring and inferring service levels.   
Active measurements, on the other hand, are more intrusive to the network in
the sense that they involve injecting synthetic test traffic into the network 
to measure network service levels, as opposed to simply observing production traffic. 
The IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Working Group produced documents that describe active measurement mechanisms
such as the One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) <xref target="RFC4656"
/>, the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) <xref target="RFC5357" />, 
and the Cisco Service-Level Assurance Protocol <xref target="RFC6812" />. 
In addition, there are some mechanisms that do not cleanly fit into either active or passive categories, 
such as Performance and Diagnostic Metrics (PDM) Destination Option techniques <xref target="RFC8250" />.</t>

<t>Active measurement mechanisms offer a high level of control over what and how to measure. 
They do not require inspecting production traffic. 
Because of this, active measurements usually offer better accuracy and privacy
than passive measurement mechanisms. Traffic encryption and regulations that
limit the amount of payload inspection that can occur are
non-issues. Furthermore, active measurement mechanisms are able to detect
end-to-end network performance problems in a fine-grained way (e.g.,
simulating the traffic that must be handled considering specific SLOs). As a
result, active measurements are often preferred over passive measurement for
SLA monitoring. Measurement probes must be hosted in network devices and
measurement sessions must be activated to compute the current network metrics
(for example, metrics such as the ones described in <xref target="RFC4148"/>,
although note that <xref target="RFC4148"/> was obsoleted by <xref target="RFC6248"/>). This
activation should be dynamic in order to follow changes in network conditions,
such as those related to routes being added or new customer demands.</t>

<t>While offering many advantages, active measurements are expensive in terms
of network resource consumption.  Active measurements generally involve
measurement probes that generate synthetic test traffic that is directed at a
responder.  The responder needs to timestamp test traffic it receives and
reflect it back to the originating measurement probe.  The measurement probe
subsequently processes the returned packets along with time-stamping
information in order to compute service levels.   Accordingly, active
measurements consume substantial CPU cycles as well as memory of network
devices to generate and process test traffic.  In addition, synthetic traffic
increases network load.  Thus, active measurements compete for resources with other functions, including routing and switching. </t>

<t>The resources required and traffic generated by the active measurement
sessions are, in a large part, a function of the number of measured network
destinations. 
(In addition, the amount of traffic generated for each measurement plays a
role that, in turn, influences the accuracy of the measurement.)
   When more destinations are measured, a greater number of resources are
   consumed and more traffic is needed to perform the measurements. 
Thus, to have better monitoring coverage, it is necessary to deploy more
sessions, which consequently increases consumed resources. 
Otherwise, enabling the observation of just a small subset of all network
flows can lead to insufficient coverage.  
</t>
<t>
Furthermore, while some end-to-end service levels can be determined by adding
up the service levels observed across different path segments, the same is not
true for all service levels.  For example, the end-to-end delay or packet loss
from a node A to a node C routed via a node B can often be computed simply by
adding delays (or loss) from A to B and from B to C.  This allows the
decomposition of a large set of end-to-end measurements into a much smaller
set of segment measurements.  However, end-to-end jitter and mean opinion
scores cannot be decomposed as easily and, for higher accuracy, must be measured end-to-end.</t>
<t>
Hence, the decision about how to place measurement probes becomes an important management activity.  
The goal is to obtain the maximum benefits of service-level monitoring with a
limited amount of measurement overhead.  
Specifically, the goal is to maximize the number of service-level violations
that are detected with a limited number of resources. </t>

<t>The use case and the solution approach described in this document address
an important practical issue.  They are intended to provide a basis for
further experimentation to lead to solutions for wider deployment.  

This document represents the consensus of the IRTF's Network Management Research Group (NMRG).  It was discussed extensively and received three separate in-depth reviews.

    <section title="Current Approaches">

<t>For feasible deployments of active measurement
solutions to distribute the available measurement sessions along the network,
the current best practice consists of relying entirely on the human
administrator's expertise to infer the best location to activate such
sessions. This is done
through several steps. First, it is necessary to collect traffic information
in order to grasp the traffic matrix. Then, the administrator uses this
information to infer the best destinations for measurement
sessions. After that, the administrator activates sessions on the chosen subset of
destinations, taking the available resources into account.  This practice, however, does not scale well because it is still labor
intensive and error-prone for the administrator to determine which sessions
should be activated given the set of critical flows that needs to be measured. 
Even worse, this practice completely fails in networks where the most critical
flows change rapidly, resulting in dynamic changes to what would be the most
important destinations. For example, this can be the case in modern cloud
environments. This is because fast reactions are necessary to reconfigure the
sessions, and administrators are just not quick enough in computing and
activating the new set of required sessions every time the network traffic
pattern changes. Finally, the current practice for active measurements usually
covers only a fraction of the network flows that should be observed, which
invariably leads to the damaging consequence of undetected SLA violations.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Use Case Description">
<t>
The use case involves a service-level provider that needs to monitor
   the network to detect service-level violations using active service-level
   measurements and wants to be able to do so with minimal human
   intervention.  
   The goal is to conduct the measurements in an effective manner to maximize the percentage of detected service-level violations.
   The service-level provider has a bounded resource
   budget with regard to measurements that can be performed,
   specifically the number of measurements that can be
   conducted concurrently from any one network device and possibly 
   the total amount of measurement traffic on the network.  However, while
   at any one point in time the number of measurements conducted is
   limited, it is possible for a device to change which destinations to
   measure over time.  This can be exploited to achieve a balance of
   eventually covering all possible destinations using a reasonable
   amount of "sampling" where measurement coverage of a destination cannot be continuous. 
   The solution needs to be dynamic and able to cope with network conditions that may change over time. 
The solution should also be embeddable inside network devices that control the deployment of active measurement mechanisms.
</t>
<t>
   The goal is to conduct the measurements in a smart manner that
   ensures that the network is broadly covered and that the likelihood of
   detecting service-level violations is maximized.  In order to
   maximize that likelihood, it is reasonable to focus measurement
   resources on destinations that are more likely to incur a violation,
   while spending fewer resources on destinations that are more likely to
   be in compliance.  In order to do this, there are various aspects that
   can be exploited, including past measurements (destinations close to
   a service-level threshold requiring more focus than destinations
   farther from it), complementation with passive measurements such as
   flow data (to identify network destinations that are currently
   popular and critical), and observations from other parts of the
   network.  In addition, measurements can be coordinated among
   different network devices to avoid hitting the same destination at
   the same time and to share results that may be useful in
   future probe placement.
</t>
<t>
 Clearly, static solutions
   will have severe limitations.  At the same time, human administrators
   cannot be in the loop for continuous dynamic reconfigurations of measurement probes.
   Thus, an automated solution, or ideally an autonomic
   solution, is needed so that network measurements are automatically
   orchestrated and dynamically reconfigured from within the network.  
   This can be accomplished using an autonomic solution that is 
   distributed, using ASAs that are implemented 
   on nodes in the network.  
</t>

    </section>

    <section title="A Distributed Autonomic Solution">
<t>The use of Autonomic Networking (AN) <xref target="RFC7575"/> can help such detection through an efficient activation of measurement sessions.  
Such an approach, along with a detailed assessment confirming its viability,
is described in <xref target="P2PBNM-Nobre-2012" />. 
The problem to be solved by AN in the present use case is how to steer the process of 
measurement session activation by a complete solution that sets all necessary parameters 
for this activation to operate efficiently, reliably, and securely,
with no required human intervention other than setting overall policy.</t>
<t>When a node first comes online, it has no information about which measurements
are more critical than others.  
In the absence of information about past measurements and information from
measurement peers, it may start
with an initial set of measurement sessions, possibly randomly seeding a set
of starter measurements
and perhaps taking a round-robin approach for subsequent measurement rounds.  
However, as measurements are collected, a node will gain an increasing amount
of information that it can utilize to 
refine its strategy of selecting measurement targets going forward.  
For one, it may take note of which targets returned measurement 
results very close to service-level thresholds; these targets may require closer scrutiny compared to 
others.  Second, it may utilize observations that are made by its measurement peers in order to 
conclude which measurement targets may be more critical than others and to ensure that 
proper overall measurement coverage is obtained (so that not every node incidentally measures the 
same targets, while other targets are not measured at all).  
</t>

<t>We advocate for embedding P2P technology in network devices in order to use
autonomic control loops to make decisions about measurement sessions.</t>

<t>
Specifically, we advocate for network devices to implement an autonomic
function that monitors service levels for violations of SLOs and that
determines which measurement sessions to set up at any given point in time
based on current and past observations of the node and of other peer nodes.
</t>

<t>
By performing these functions locally and autonomically on the device itself,
which measurements to conduct can be modified quickly based on local observations 
while taking local resource availability into account.  
This allows a solution to be more robust and react more dynamically to 
rapidly changing service levels than a solution that has to rely on central coordination. 
However, in order to optimize decisions about which measurements to conduct, a
node will need to communicate with 
other nodes.  This allows a node to take into account other nodes'
observations in addition to its own in its decisions.  
</t>
<t>
For example, remote destinations whose observed service levels are on the verge of violating stated 
objectives may require closer monitoring than remote destinations 
that are comfortably within a range of tolerance.  
A distributed autonomic solution also allows nodes to coordinate their probing
decisions to collectively achieve the best possible measurement
coverage. Because the number of resources available for monitoring, exchanging
measurement data, and coordinating with other nodes is limited, a node may be
interested in identifying other nodes whose observations are similar to and
correlated with its own. This helps a node prioritize and decide which other nodes to
coordinate and exchange data with. All of this requires the use of a P2P overlay.  
</t>
<t>
A P2P overlay is essential for several reasons:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
It makes it possible for nodes (or more specifically, the ASAs that are deployed on those nodes) in the network to autonomically set
up measurement sessions without having to rely on a central management system
or controller to perform configuration operations associated with configuring
measurement  probes and responders.</t>
<t> It facilitates the exchange of data between different nodes to share measurement results so that 
each node can refine its measurement strategy based not just on its own
observations, but also on observations 
from its peers.  </t>  
<t> It allows nodes to coordinate their measurements to obtain the best possible test coverage and avoid 
measurements that have a very low likelihood of detecting service-level violations. </t> 
</list>
</t>
<t>The provisioning of the P2P overlay  
should be transparent for the network administrator.  An Autonomic Control Plane such as 
defined in <xref target="ACP"/> 
provides an ideal candidate for the P2P overlay to run on.     
</t>
<t>An autonomic solution for the distributed detection of SLA violations provides several benefits. 
First, it provides efficiency; this solution should optimize the resource consumption and avoid resource starvation on the network devices. 
A device that is "self-aware" of its available resources will be able to adjust measurement activities rapidly as needed, 
without requiring a separate control loop involving resource monitoring by an external system.  
   Second, placing logic about where to conduct measurements into the node
   enables rapid control loops that allow devices to react instantly to observations and
   adjust their measurement strategy.  
For example, a device could decide to adjust the amount of 
synthetic test traffic being sent during the measurement itself depending on results observed so far on this and other concurrent 
measurement sessions.  
As a result, the solution could decrease the time necessary to detect SLA violations. 
Adaptivity features of an autonomic loop could capture the network dynamics
faster than a human administrator or even a central controller. 
Finally, the solution could help to reduce the workload of human
administrators.
</t>
<t>In practice, these factors combine to maximize the likelihood of SLA
violations being detected while operating within a given resource budget,
allowing a continuous measurement strategy that takes into account past
measurement results to be conducted, observations of other measures such as
link utilization or flow data, measurement results shared between network
devices, and future measurement activities coordinated among nodes. Combined, this can result in efficient measurement decisions that achieve a golden balance between 
offering broad network coverage and honing in on service-level "hot spots".</t> 
    </section>

    <section title="Intended User Experience">
<t>The autonomic solution should not require any human intervention in the
distributed detection of SLA violations.
By virtue of the solution being autonomic, human users will not have to plan
which measurements to conduct 
in a network, which is often a very labor-intensive task that requires detailed
analysis of traffic matrices and network topologies and is not prone to easy
dynamic adjustment.  Likewise, they will not have to configure measurement
probes and responders.    

</t>
<t>
There are some ways in which a human administrator may still interact with the solution.  
First, the human administrator will, of course, be notified and obtain reports about service-level 
violations that are observed.  Second, a human administrator may set policies regarding how closely to monitor the network for service-level violations and how many resources to spend.  For example, an administrator may set 
a resource budget that is assigned to network devices for measurement operations.  With that given budget, the number of SLO violations that are detected will be maximized.  Alternatively, an administrator may 
set a target for the percentage of SLO violations that must be detected, i.e.,
a target for the ratio 
between the number of detected SLO violations and the number of total SLO
violations that are actually 
occurring (some of which might go undetected).  In that case, the solution
will aim to minimize the 
resources spent (i.e., the amount of test traffic and number of measurement sessions)
that are required to achieve that target.   
</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Implementation Considerations">

<t>The active measurement model assumes that a typical infrastructure will
have multiple network segments, multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes), and a reasonably
large number of routers. It also considers that multiple SLOs can be in place
at a given time. Since interoperability in a heterogeneous network is a goal,
features found on different active measurement mechanisms (e.g., OWAMP, TWAMP,
and Cisco Service Level Assurance Protocol) and device programmability interfaces (such as Juniper's Junos API
or Cisco's Embedded Event Manager) could be used for the implementation. The
autonomic solution should include and/or reference specific algorithms,
protocols, metrics, and technologies for the implementation of distributed
detection of SLA violations as a whole.</t>

<t>Finally, it should be noted that there are multiple deployment scenarios,
including deployment scenarios that involve physical devices hosting autonomic
functions or virtualized infrastructure hosting the same.  Co-deployment in
conjunction with Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) is a possibility for further
study.

</t>

    <section title="Device-Based Self-Knowledge and Decisions">

<t>Each device has self-knowledge about the local SLA monitoring. This could
be in the form of historical measurement data and SLOs. Besides that, the
devices would have algorithms that could decide which probes should be activated at
a given time. The choice of which algorithm is better for a specific situation
would be also autonomic.</t>
      </section>

    <section title="Interaction with Other Devices">


<t>Network devices should share information about service-level measurement results. This information can speed up the detection of SLA violations and increase the number of detected SLA violations. For example, if one device detects that a remote destination is in danger of violating an SLO, other devices may conduct additional measurements to the same destination or other destinations in its proximity.  For any given network device, the exchange of data may be more important with some devices (for example, devices in the same network neighborhood or devices that are "correlated" by some other means) than with others.   
   Defining the network devices that
   exchange measurement data (i.e., management peers) creates a new
   topology. Different approaches could be used
to define this topology (e.g., correlated peers <xref
target="P2PBNM-Nobre-2012" />). 
To bootstrap peer selection, each device should use its known neighbors (e.g., FIB and RIB tables) as initial seeds to identify possible peers.
It should be noted that a solution will benefit if topology information and network discovery functions are provided by the underlying autonomic framework.  A solution will need 
to be able to discover measurement peers as well as measurement targets,
specifically measurement targets that support active measurement responders
and that will be able to respond to measurement 
requests and reflect measurement traffic as needed.

    <section title="Comparison with Current Solutions">
        <t>There is no standardized solution for distributed autonomic
	detection of SLA violations. Current solutions are restricted to ad
	hoc scripts running on a per-node fashion to automate some
	administrator actions. There are some proposals for passive probe
	activation (e.g., DECON <xref target="DECON"/> and CSAMP <xref target="CSAMP"/>), but these do not focus on autonomic

<list style="numbers">

<t>LMAP: The Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance Working Group
standardizes the LMAP measurement system for performance management of
broadband access devices. The autonomic solution could be relevant to LMAP because
it deploys measurement probes and could be used for screening
for SLA violations. Besides that, a solution to decrease the workload of human administrators in service
providers is probably highly desirable.
</t>
<t>IPFIX: IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Working Group (now concluded)
aimed to standardize IP flows (i.e., netflows). IPFIX uses measurement probes
(i.e., metering exporters) to gather flow data. In this context, the autonomic
solution for the activation of active measurement probes could possibly be
extended to also address passive measurement probes. 
   Besides that, flow
   information could be used in making decisions regarding probe
   activation.

<t>ALTO: The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization Working Group aims to
provide topological information at a higher abstraction layer, which can be
based upon network policy, and with application-relevant service functions

i.e., the Autonomic Control Plane. If the Autonomic Control Plane were to be
compromised, an attacker could undermine the effectiveness of measurement
coordination by reporting fraudulent measurement results to peers.  This would
cause measurement probes to be deployed in an ineffective manner that would
increase the likelihood that violations of SLOs go undetected.

<t>
Likewise, the security of the solution hinges on the security of the
deployment mechanism for autonomic functions (in this case, the autonomic
function that conducts the service-level measurements).  If an attacker were
able to hijack an autonomic function, it could try to exhaust or exceed the
resources that should be spent on autonomic measurements in order to deplete
network resources, including network 
bandwidth due to higher-than-necessary volumes of synthetic test traffic
generated by measurement probes.  Again, it could also lead to reporting of
misleading results; among other things, this could result in
non-optimal selection of measurement targets and, in turn, an increase in the
likelihood that service-level violations go undetected.
