         <abstract>
         <t>This specification defines a Uniform Resource Name (URN)
         namespace for the Global System for Mobile Communications
         Association (GSMA) and a Namespace Specific String (NSS) for the
         International Mobile station Equipment Identity (IMEI), as well as an
         associated parameter for the International Mobile station Equipment
         Identity and Software Version number (IMEISV). The IMEI and IMEISV
         were introduced as part of the specification for the GSM and are
         also now incorporated by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project
         (3GPP) as part of the 3GPP specification for GSM, Universal Mobile
         Telecommunications System (UMTS), and 3GPP Long Term Evolution
         (LTE) networks. The IMEI and IMEISV are used to uniquely identify
         Mobile Equipment within these systems and are managed by the GSMA.
         URNs from this namespace almost always contain personally
         identifiable information and need to be treated accordingly.</t>

                <section title="Introduction">
                 <t>This specification defines a Uniform Resource Name (URN)
namespace for the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA)
and a Namespace Specific String (NSS) for the International Mobile station
Equipment Identity (IMEI), as well as an associated parameter for the
International Mobile station Equipment Identity and Software Version number
(IMEISV) as per the namespace registration requirement found in
RFC 3406 <xref target="RFC3406"/>. The Namespace Identifier (NID) 'gsma'
is for identities used in GSM, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System
(UMTS), and Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks. The IMEI and the IMEISV are
managed by the GSMA, so this NID is managed by the GSMA. While this
specification currently defines only the 'imei' NSS under the 'gsma' NID,
additional NSS under the 'gsma' NID may be specified in the future by the
GSMA, using the procedure for URN NSS changes and additions (currently
through the publication of future Informational RFCs approved by IETF
consensus).</t>

                 <t>The IMEI is 15 decimal digits long and includes a Type Allocation Code 
                    (TAC) of 8 decimal digits and a Serial Number (SNR) of 6 decimal digits 
                plus a Spare decimal digit. The TAC identifies the type of the Mobile 
                Equipment and is chosen from a range of values allocated to the Mobile
                Equipment manufacturer in order to uniquely identify the model of the Mobile 
                Equipment. The SNR is an individual serial number that uniquely identifies 
                each Mobile Equipment device within the TAC. The Spare digit is used as a 
                Check digit to validate the IMEI and is always set to the value 0 when 
                transmitted by the Mobile Equipment.</t>
                 <t>The IMEISV is 16 decimal digits long and includes the TAC and SNR, same as for 
the IMEI, but also includes a 2 decimal digit Software Version Number (SVN),
which is allocated by the Mobile Equipment manufacturer to identify the software 
                version of the Mobile Equipment.</t>
                 <t>The information here is meant to be a concise guide for
those wishing to use the IMEI and IMEISV as URNs.  Nothing in this document
should be construed to override 3GPP Technical Specification (TS)
23.003 <xref target="refs.TS-23.003"/>, which specifies the IMEI
and IMEISV.</t>
                 <t>The GSMA is a global trade association representing 
nearly 800 mobile phone operators across 220 territories and 
countries of the world. The primary goals of the GSMA are to ensure that
mobile phones and wireless services work globally and are easily accessible. 
Further details about the GSMA's role in allocating the IMEI and the IMEISV,
as well as the IMEI and IMEISV allocation guidelines, can be found in 
GSMA Permanent Reference Document (PRD) TS.06 <xref target="refs.DG.06"/>. </t>

                 <t>The optional 'vers' parameter and the 'ext-imei' field
in the ABNF are included for extensibility of the 'imei' NSS -- for example,
if the IMEI format is extended in the future (such as with
additional digits or using hex digits). In this case, the 'vers' parameter 
would contain a non-zero value and the 'ext-imei' would be further
defined to represent the syntax of the extended IMEI format. A value of
the 'vers' parameter equal to 0 or the absence of the 'vers' parameter
means the URN format is compliant with the format specified here.</t>

<t>Any change to the format of the 'imei' NSS requires the use of the
procedure for URN NSS changes and additions (currently through the
publication of future Informational RFCs approved by IETF consensus). The
use of the 'vers' parameter was chosen for extensibility instead of defining
a new NSS (e.g., 'imei2') because it is likely that many applications
will only need to perform string compares of the 'imeival'. So, even if
the format or length of the 'imeival' changes in the future, such
applications should continue to work without having to be updated to
understand a new NSS.</t>

                 <t>RFC 7255 <xref target="RFC7255"/> specifies how
the GSMA IMEI URN can be used as an instance ID as specified in RFC 5626 <xref
target="RFC5626"/>. Any future value of the 'vers' parameter other than 0, or
the definition of additional parameters that are intended to be used as part
of an instance ID, will require an update to RFC 7255 <xref target="RFC7255"/>. </t>

                <t> For example:</t>
                  <t><list style="hanging">                 
                   <t> urn:gsma:imei:90420156-025763-0;vers=0 </t>
                  </list></t>

                  <t>The IMEISV is an identifier that uniquely identifies
mobile devices and their associated software versions used in the GSM,
UMTS, and LTE networks. The representation of the IMEISV 
is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 <xref target="refs.TS-23.003"/>.</t>

                    <t>To represent the IMEISV, the URN parameter 'svn' is
appended to the GSMA IMEI URN and set equal to the decimal string
representation of the two software version number (svn) digits in the
IMEISV, and the Spare digit in the IMEI 'imeival' is set to zero.</t>

operator's customer care desk) and also to help guard against the
possibility of incorrect entries being provisioned in the network equipment. 
The Spare is always set to zero when transmitted by the Mobile Equipment
(including when in the IMEI URN format). 
Annex B of 3GPP TS 23.003 <xref target="refs.TS-23.003"/> specifies a

    <section anchor="Community" title="Community Considerations">
    <t>GSM, UMTS, and LTE mobile devices will be interoperating with Internet
    devices for a variety of voice and data services. To do this, they
    need to make use of Internet protocols that will operate end to end
    between devices in GSM/UMTS/LTE networks and those in the general
    Internet. Some of these protocols require the use of URNs as
    identifiers. Within the GSM/UMTS/LTE networks, mobile devices are
    identified by their IMEI or IMEISV. Internet users will need to be
    able to receive and include the GSMA URN in various Internet protocol
    elements to facilitate communication between pure Internet-based
    devices and GSM/UMTS/LTE mobile devices. Thus, the existence and syntax
    of these namespaces need to be available to the general Internet
    community, and the namespace needs to be reserved with IANA in order to
    guarantee uniqueness and prevent potential namespace conflicts both
    within the Internet and within GSM/UMTS/LTE networks. Conversely, 
    Internet implementations will not generally possess IMEI identifiers. 
    The identifiers generated by such implementations will typically be URNs 
    within namespaces other than 'gsma' and may, depending on context, even 
    be non-URN URIs. Implementations are advised to be ready to process URIs 
    other than 'gsma' namespaced URNs, so as to aid in interoperability.</t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="Namespace" title="Namespace Considerations">
    <t>A URN was considered the most appropriate URI to represent the IMEI and
    IMEISV, as these identifiers may be used and transported similarly to the
    Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), which is defined as a URN in
    RFC 4122 <xref target="RFC4122"/>. Since specifications for protocols 
    that are used to transport device identifiers often require the device
    identifier to be globally unique and in the URN format, it is necessary
    that the URN formats are defined to represent the IMEI and IMEISV. </t> 
  </section>

  <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
     <t> In accordance with BCP 66 (RFC 3406) <xref target="RFC3406"/>, IANA
     has registered the Formal URN Namespace 'gsma' in the
     "Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespaces" registry, using the
     registration template presented in <xref target="reg-template"/> of
     this document.</t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="Security" title="Security and Privacy Considerations">
     <t>IMEIs (but with the Spare value set to the value of the
     Check digit) are displayable on most mobile devices and in many cases
     are printed on the case within the battery compartment. Anyone with
     brief physical access to the mobile device can therefore easily obtain
     the IMEI. Therefore, IMEIs MUST NOT be used as security capabilities 
     (identifiers whose mere possession grants access). Unfortunately,
     there are currently examples of some applications that are using the
     IMEI for authorization. Also, some service provider's customer
     service departments have been known to use knowledge of the IMEI as
     "proof" that the caller is the legitimate owner of the mobile device.
     Both of these are inappropriate uses of the IMEI.</t>

     <t>While the specific software version of the mobile device only
     identifies the lower-layer software that has undergone and passed
     certification testing, and not the operating system or application
     software, the software version could identify software that is
     vulnerable to attacks or is known to contain security holes.
     Therefore, the IMEISV MUST only be delivered to trusted entities
     within carrier networks and not provided to the Internet at large,
     as it could help a malicious device identify that the mobile device
     is running software that is known to be vulnerable to certain attacks.
     This concern is similar to concerns regarding the use of the
     User-Agent header in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as
     specified in RFC 3261 <xref target="RFC3261"/>. Therefore, the
     IMEISV (that is, the IMEI URN with a 'svn'
     parameter) MUST NOT be delivered to devices that are not trusted.
     IMEIs are almost always personally identifiable 
     information, and so these URNs MUST be treated
     as personally identifiable information in all cases. 
     In order to prevent violating a user's privacy, the IMEI URN
     MUST NOT be included in messages intended to convey any level of
     anonymity.</t>  

    <t>Since the IMEI is permanently assigned to the mobile device and is not
    modified when the ownership of the mobile device changes (even
    upon a complete software reload of the device), the IMEI URN MUST NOT
    be used as a user identifier or user address by an application. Using the
    IMEI to identify a user or as a user address could result in
    communications destined for a previous owner of a device being 
    received by the new device owner or could allow the new device owner
    to access information or services owned by the previous device owner.</t>

    <t>Additionally, since the IMEI identifies the mobile device, it
    potentially could be used to identify and track users for the
    purposes of surveillance and call data mining if sent in the clear.</t>

    <t>Since the IMEI is personally identifiable information, uses of
    the IMEI URN with IETF protocols require a specification and IETF
    Expert Review <xref target="RFC5226"/> in order to ensure that
    privacy concerns are appropriately addressed. Protocols carrying
    the IMEI URN SHOULD at a minimum use channels that are strongly
    hop-by-hop encrypted, and it is RECOMMENDED that end-to-end
    encryption be used.</t>

    <t>Additional security considerations are specified in 3GPP TS 22.016
    <xref target="refs.TS-22.016"/>. Specifically, the IMEI is to be
    incorporated in a module that is contained within the terminal.
    The IMEI SHALL NOT be changed after the terminal's production process.
    It SHALL resist tampering, i.e., manipulation and change, by any
    means (e.g., physical, electrical, and software).</t>
