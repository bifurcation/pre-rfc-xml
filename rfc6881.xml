<abstract>
<t>The IETF and other standards organizations have efforts targeted at
standardizing various aspects of placing emergency 
calls on IP networks. This memo describes best current practice on how devices,
networks, and services using IETF protocols should use such standards to make
emergency calls.</t>
</abstract>
</front>

<middle>
<section title="Introduction">
<t>This document describes how access networks, Session Initiation Protocol
<xref target="RFC3261"/> user agents, proxy servers, and Public Safety Answering
Points (PSAPs) support emergency calling, as 
outlined in <xref target="RFC6443"></xref>, which is designed to complement the
present document in section headings, numbering, and content. 
Understanding <xref target="RFC6443"></xref> is necessary to understand this
document.  This Best Current Practice (BCP) succinctly describes the 
requirements of end devices and applications (requirements prefaced by "ED-"), access networks (including enterprise access networks)
(requirements prefaced by "AN-"), service providers (requirements prefaced by "SP-"), and PSAPs to 
achieve globally interoperable emergency calling on the Internet. </t>
<t>This document also defines requirements for "intermediate" devices
that exist between end devices or applications and the access network.  For example, a home router is
an intermediate device.  Reporting location on an emergency call (see <xref target="Location"></xref>) 
may depend on the ability of such intermediate devices to meet the requirements prefaced by "INT-".</t>
<t>The access network requirements apply to those networks that may be used to place emergency calls using IETF protocols.  Local regulations may impact the need to support this document's access network requirements.</t>
<t>Other organizations, such as the National Emergency Number Association
(NENA), define the PSAP interface.  NENA's documents reference this
document.</t>

<section title="Terminology">
<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", 
"RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref 
target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
<t>This document uses terms from <xref target="RFC3261"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5012"></xref>, and <xref target="RFC6443"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section title="Overview of How Emergency Calls Are Placed">
<t>An emergency call can be distinguished (<xref target="Identifying"></xref>) from any other call 
by a unique service URN <xref target="RFC5031"></xref> that is placed in the 
call setup signaling when a home or visited emergency dial string is detected. Because emergency 
services are local to specific geographic regions, a caller must obtain his location (<xref 
target="Location"></xref>) prior to making emergency calls. To get this
location, either a form of 
measuring (e.g., GPS) (<xref target="RFC6443"></xref> Section 6.2.3) device
location in the endpoint is deployed or the endpoint is configured (<xref 
target="LocationConfiguration"></xref>) with its location from the access network's Location
Information Server (LIS).  The location is conveyed (<xref target="Conveyance"></xref>) in the SIP 
signaling with the call. The call is routed (<xref target="Routing"></xref>) based on location 
using the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol <xref target="RFC5222"></xref>, which maps a location to 
a set of PSAP URIs. Each URI 
resolves to a PSAP or an Emergency Services Routing Proxy (ESRP) that serves a group of PSAPs. The 
call arrives at the PSAP with the location included in the SIP INVITE request. </t>

<section anchor="WhichDevices" title="Which Devices and Services Should Support Emergency Calls?">
<t>
  <list style="hanging">
  <t hangText="ED-1:">A device or application that implements SIP calling SHOULD
   support emergency calling. Some jurisdictions have regulations
   governing which devices need to support emergency calling, and
   developers are encouraged to ensure that devices they develop
   meet relevant regulatory requirements. Unfortunately, the
   natural variation in those regulations also makes it impossible
   to accurately describe the cases when developers do or do not have
   to support emergency calling.</t>

  <t hangText="SP-1:">If a device or application expects to be able to place a call for help, the service provider that 
supports it MUST facilitate emergency calling.  Some jurisdictions have regulations governing
this.</t>
  <t hangText="ED-2:">Devices that create media sessions and exchange real-time
audio, video, and/or text and that have the 
capability to establish sessions to a wide variety of addresses and communicate over private IP 
networks or the Internet SHOULD support emergency calls.  Some jurisdictions have regulations governing
this.</t>

<section anchor="Location" title="Location and Its Role in an Emergency Call">
<t>Handling location for emergency calling usually involves several steps to process, and multiple entities are involved. In 
Internet emergency calling, where the endpoint is located is determined using a variety of 
measurement or wire-tracing methods. Endpoints can be configured with their own location by the 
access network. In some circumstances, a proxy server can insert location into the signaling on 
behalf of the endpoint. The location is mapped to the URI to send the call to, and the location 
is conveyed to the PSAP (and other entities) in the signaling. Likewise, we employ Location 
Configuration Protocols (LCPs), the Location-to-Service Mapping Protocol, and Location Conveyance Protocols for these 
functions. The Location-to-Service Translation protocol 
<xref target="RFC5222"></xref> is the Location Mapping Protocol defined by the 
IETF.</t>

<section anchor="LocationTypes" title="Types of Location Information">
<t>There are several forms of location. All IETF location configuration and location conveyance protocols support both civic and geospatial (geo) 
forms. The civic forms include both postal and jurisdictional fields. A cell 
tower/sector can be represented as a point (geo or civic) or polygon. 
Endpoints, intermediate devices, and service providers receiving 
other forms of location representation MUST map them into either 
a geo or civic for use in emergency calls.
</t>
 <t>
 <list style="hanging">
<t hangText="ED-12/INT-1/SP-10:">Endpoints, intermediate devices, and service
providers MUST be prepared to handle location represented in either civic or
geo form.</t>
<t hangText="ED-13/INT-2/SP-11/AN-2:">Entities MUST NOT convert (civic to geo
or geo to civic) from the form of location that the determination mechanism
(see <xref target="LocationDetermination"/>) supplied prior to receipt by the
PSAP.</t>

 <t>
 <list style="hanging">
<t hangText="ED-15/INT-4/AN-4:">Devices, intermediate devices, and/or access networks SHOULD support a manual method to override the 
location the access network determines. When the override location is supplied
in civic form, it MUST be possible for the resultant Presence Information Data

<t hangText="AN-6/INT-5:">Access networks and intermediate devices providing wire database location information SHOULD provide interior 
location data (building, floor, room, cubicle) where possible. It is RECOMMENDED that interior location be provided when spaces

<section anchor="UAsignaling" title="SIP Signaling Requirements for User Agents">
<t>ED-62: The initial SIP signaling method is an INVITE request:
<list style="numbers">
<t>The Request URI SHOULD be the service URN in the "sos" tree. If the device does not interpret local dial strings, the Request-URI MUST be a dial string URI <xref 
target="RFC4967"></xref> with the dialed digits.</t>
<t>The To header field SHOULD be a service URN in the "sos" tree. If the device
does not interpret local dial strings, the To: MUST be a dial string URI with the dialed 
digits.</t>
<t>The From header field SHOULD contain the address of record (AoR) of the
caller.</t>
<t>A Route header field SHOULD be present with a PSAP URI obtained from LoST (see <xref 
target="Routing"></xref>). If the device does not interpret dial plans or
was unable to obtain a route from a LoST server, no such Route header field
will be present.</t>
<t>A Contact header field MUST be globally routable, for example, a
Globally Routable User Agent URI (GRUU) <xref 
target="RFC5627"></xref>, and be valid for several minutes following the termination of the call, 
provided that the User Agent Client (UAC) remains registered with the same
registrar, to permit an immediate callback to the specific device that
placed the emergency call.  It is acceptable if the UAC inserts a locally
routable URI and a subsequent back-to-back user agent (B2BUA) maps that to a
globally routable URI.</t>
<t>Other header fields MAY be included as per normal SIP behavior.</t>
<t>If a geolocation URI is included in the INVITE, a Supported header field
MUST be included with a 'geolocation-sip' or 'geolocation-http" option tag, as
appropriate <xref target="RFC6442"></xref>.</t>
<t>If a device understands the SIP location conveyance 
<xref target="RFC6442"></xref> extension and has its location available, it
MUST include location as either location-by-value or location-by-reference, or
both, according to the rules within RFC 6442.</t>
<t>An SDP offer SHOULD be included in the INVITE. If voice is supported, the
offer SHOULD include the G.711 codec; see <xref target="Media"></xref>.  As
PSAPs may support a wide range of media types and codecs, sending an offerless
INVITE may result in a lengthy return offer but is permitted.  Cautions in
<xref target="RFC3261"/> on offerless INVITEs should be considered before such
use.</t>
<t>If the device includes location-by-value, the user agent (UA) MUST support
multipart message bodies, since SDP will likely be also in the INVITE.</t>

<t>SP-33: SIP proxy servers processing emergency calls:

<t>If the proxy interprets dial plans on behalf of user agents, the proxy MUST look for 
the local emergency dial string at the location of the end device and MAY look for the home dial string. If it finds it, the proxy MUST: 
<list style="symbols">

<t>If the proxy recognizes the service URN in the Request URI and does not find a Route
header, it MUST query a LoST server immediately. If a location was provided (which should be the 
case), the proxy uses that location to query LoST.  The proxy may have to
dereference a location-by-reference to get a value.  If a location is not present and the proxy can query a LIS that
has the location of the UA, it MUST do so.  If no location is present and the proxy does not have 
access to a LIS that could provide location, the proxy MUST supply a default location (see <xref 
target="DefaultLocation"></xref>).  The location (in the signaling, obtained from a LIS, or 
default) MUST be used in a query to LoST with the service URN received with the call.  The 
resulting URI MUST be placed in a Route header added to the call.</t>
<t>The proxy  
MAY add a Geolocation header field. Such an additional location SHOULD NOT be used for routing; the 
location provided by the UA should be used.</t>
<t>Either a P-Asserted-Identity <xref target="RFC3325"></xref> or an Identity header field <xref 
target="RFC4474"></xref>, or both, SHOULD be included to identify the sender. For services that
must support emergency calls from unauthenticated devices, valid identity may
not be available.  Proxies encountering a P-Asserted-Identity will need to pass
the header to the PSAP, which is in a different domain. 

<xref target="RFC3325"/> requires a "spec(T)" to determine what happens if either the
"id" privacy service or a Privacy header is present and requests privacy. In
the
absence of another spec(T), such proxies should pass the header unmodified if
and only if the connection between the proxy and the PSAP is, as far as the
proxy can determine, protected by TLS with mutual authentication using keys
reliably known by the parties, encrypted with no less strength than AES, and
the local regulations governing the PSAP do not specify otherwise.</t>
<t>Proxies SHOULD NOT return a 424 error. They should process the INVITE as best they can.</t>
<t>Proxies SHOULD NOT obey a Geolocation-Routing value of "no" or a missing value if they must query LoST to obtain a route.  Emergency calls are always routed by location.</t>

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
<t>Security considerations for emergency calling have been documented in
