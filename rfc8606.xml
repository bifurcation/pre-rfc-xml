	The SIP Reason header field is defined to carry ISUP
	(ISDN User Part) cause values
	as well as SIP response codes. Some services in SIP networks  
	may need to know the ISUP location where the call was released
	in the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) to correctly
	interpret the reason of release.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
    <t>Section 3.4 of <xref target="RFC3326"/> describes a SIP message flow
    for canceling an INVITE request when a REL (release) message is received
    from the ISUP side. That document specifies the SIP Reason header field
    <xref target="RFC3326"/> that is used to indicate the reason of release.
The reason of release indicates why a SIP Dialog or a PSTN call, in cases where
the call was interworked to the PSTN, was terminated. The termination may be
normal, based on a failure within an entity (e.g. temporary failure) or caused
by other factors (e.g., congestion). The reason may be a SIP response or an ISUP release
cause as specified within <xref target="Q.850"/>. <xref target="RFC6432"/>
specifies that an ISUP <xref target="Q.850"/> cause code can be carried within
a SIP response, but not the Q.850 location information. The <xref
target="Q.850"/> location information identifies the part of the ISUP network
where the call was released.
    </t>
    <t>
   This document adds a location value parameter to the reason-extension
   parameter defined in <xref target="RFC3326"/> so that the <xref
   target="Q.850"/> location value can be interworked from the PSTN. The
   interworking from the PSTN needs only to include the location received by
   the interworking gateway. <xref target="Q.850"/> describes the definitions
   of the cause code values and the locations used in ISDN and DSS1 (Digital
   Subscriber Signalling System No.&nbsp;1) environments. The cause code is
   used for identifying the reason of release of a call, and the location
   identifies where the call was released.

    <section anchor="rationale" title="Rationale">
    
      <t>The primary intent of the parameter defined in this specification is for use in
         IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) networks defined by 3GPP, but it is also
	 open to be used by any other networks that include ISUP interworking 
         gateways and use Q.850 reason codes.  

The purpose of this parameter is to hold the location of the call release so
   that it can be transported from the originating PSTN entity to the SIP
   entity via a response or BYE message.
        
        The ISDN location is defined in <xref target="Q.850"/>.

	<t>This specification adds a parameter with the ISUP location value defined in <xref target="Q.850"/> to the Reason header field

      <t> While the addition of the location parameter 
         provides an indicator of the entity that added the location in the signaling
         path, it provides little more exposure than the <xref target="Q.850"/> cause itself.
The ISUP location value itself will not reveal the identity of the originating or terminating party of the call.  It shows only the ISUP network location of the device that released the call. The ISUP location does not show the physical location of the caller or callee.

      <t>This document doesn't change any of the security considerations described in
         <xref target="RFC3326"/>. The addition of the location parameter 
         provides an indicator of the <xref target="Q.850"/> location where
	 the call was released within the PSTN. This information may be used
	 for specific location-driven services but does not create any
	 additional security constraints. Because the <xref target="Q.850"/>
	 location is very imprecise, the <xref target="Q.850"/> location value
	 itself will not add any major security constraints. The use of this
	 parameter is not restricted to a specific architecture.

     <t>
     <xref target="RFC3398"/> describes detailed security considerations due to
  interworking between ISUP and SIP.    Beyond these considerations, the
  addition of the location does not introduce new security concerns. 
The location shows the network part where the call was released. Knowing this
does not increase the possibilities of extended fraud scenarios.
