<abstract>
<t>This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace
   intended for persistently and uniquely naming resources published by the
   Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS).

<section title="Introduction">
<t>
   The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems
   (CCSDS) <xref target="CCSDS" /> was formed 
   in 1982 by the major space agencies of the world to provide a forum
   for discussion of common problems in the development and operation of
   space data systems.  At the time of publication of this document, it
   is composed of eleven member agencies, twenty-eight observer agencies,
   and over 100 industrial associates.  Since its establishment, CCSDS
   has been actively developing recommendations for data- and
   information-systems standards, intended to promote interoperability
   and cross support among cooperating space agencies.
</t>
<t>CCSDS has a permanent secretariat reporting to the CCSDS Engineering
Steering Group, which maintains documents for the CCSDS protocols. CCSDS also
has its Naming Authority under the Space Assigned
Number Authority (SANA) <xref target="SANA" />
that manages its registries and namespaces.</t> 
<t>
CCSDS produces protocol standards documents requiring a permanent and unique
namespace.  CCSDS also uses Extensible Markup Language (XML) schemas to define
XML messaging in its various protocols recommendations. These schemas require
a persistent, unique, and location-independent namespace for identification
purposes. 
</t>
<t>
This namespace specification is for a formal namespace identifier (NID), as
per <xref target="RFC3406"/>. 
</t>
</section>
<section title="Requirements Language Section"> 
  <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"

</section>
 <section title="Declaration of Syntactic Structure">
   <t>The formal syntax definitions below are given in ABNF <xref target="RFC5234"/>.</t>
   <t>The namespace-specific string (NSS) in the urn:ccsds names hierarchy
   begins with a subnamespace identifier (SNID), followed by a delimiter
   and a subnamespace-dependent string</t>
   <t>CCCSDS-URN  =  "urn:ccsds:" SNID ":" SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING</t>
   <t>where &lt;SNID&gt; is a unique subnamespace identifier for the
   specification, and &lt;SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING&gt; is a unique
   identifier within the subnamespace identifier scope.</t>

   <t>&lt;SNID&gt; has the same syntax as an &lt;NID&gt; as defined in <xref target="RFC2141"/>.</t>

   <t>SANA assigns SNIDs.</t>

   <t>The syntax of &lt;SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING&gt; is dependent on the
   &lt;SNID&gt; and MUST be defined by a CCSDS document.  This
   document does not pose any additional restrictions to the
   &lt;SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING&gt; other than what is defined in the NSS
   syntax as defined by <xref target="RFC2141"/>:</t>

      <t>SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING  =  1*&lt;URN chars&gt;</t>

   <t>&lt;URN chars&gt; is defined in Section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC2141"/>.</t>
</section>
<section title="Relevant Ancillary Documentation">
<t>SANA keeps the "urn:ccsds" namespace as a registry <xref target="SANA-Reg"
/>. Procedures to register
a subnamespace identifier are 
described in the header of the registry.</t>
</section>
<section title="Identifier Uniqueness Considerations">
<t>SANA is the authority responsible for uniqueness of identifiers by the
recommendations of CCSDS. SANA will assign unique identifiers and keep a 
public registry <xref target="SANA-Reg" />.</t> 
</section>
<section title="Identifier Persistence Considerations">
<t>CCSDS is committed to guaranteeing the accessibility and
         persistence of all the resources that are assigned URNs.</t>
</section>
<section title="Process of Identifier Assignment">

<t>Assignment of identifiers is limited to CCSDS and those
         authorities explicitly designated by CCSDS.  CCSDS is committed
         to assigning URN identifiers only in accordance with the rules specified
         in this document or in future updates to this document, either
         published as IETF RFC documents or as CCSDS recommendations.</t>
</section>
<section title="Process for Identifier Resolution">

<t>
  The CCSDS namespace is not currently listed with a Resolution Discovery
   System (RDS), but nothing about the namespace prohibits the future
   definition of appropriate resolution methods or listing with an RDS.</t>
</section>
<section title="Rules for Lexical Equivalence">

  <t>The &lt;SNID&gt; part of URNs in the CCSDS hierarchy is case insensitive.
   Thus, the &lt;SNID&gt; MUST be case normalized before comparison.</t>
</section>
<section title="Conformance with URN Syntax">


 <t>The intention of this document is to only restrict the syntax of the
   &lt;SNID&gt;.  The syntax of the &lt;SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING&gt; follows the
   general syntax of a URN:</t>

      <t>SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING  =  1*&lt;URN chars&gt;</t>

   <t>Documents defining a subnamespace identifier SHOULD specify further
   syntactic restrictions in &lt;SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING&gt;.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that these documents forbid the assignment of URNs
   containing characters in the &lt;reserved&gt; set ("%", "/", "?", and "#")
   as defined in <xref target="RFC2141"/>.  This is in accordance with Section 2.2 of
   <xref target="RFC3986"/>.</t>
</section>
<section title="Validation Mechanism">

   <t>The validation mechanism of URNs in the hierarchy is specific for
   each SNID and SHOULD be defined when an SNID is assigned.</t>
   <t>URNs in the hierarchy without an assigned SNID are considered to
   be invalid.</t>
</section>
<section title="Scope">

   <t>Global URNs are relevant for the space agencies networks both in space and on Earth.</t>
</section>
</section>
<section title="Examples">

<t>URNs in this section are not guaranteed to be real and are listed
   here only for illustration purposes.  The following are examples of
   valid URNs for the "document" and "schema" categories:</t>
<t>
 <list hangIndent="5">
  <t>urn:ccsds:document:313x0y1</t>
  <t>urn:ccsds:schema:ndm:aem</t>
 </list>
</t>
</section>
<section title="Namespace Considerations">
<t>CCSDS is an international standards development organization in the field of space and Earth communications. The use of this URN hierarchy is expected to be broad, including but not limited to usage for:
<list>
 <t>CCSDS documents</t>
 <t>XML Schemas</t>
 <t>CCSDS registries</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>The CCSDS documents and registries are available openly.</t>
</section>
<section title="Community Considerations">
<t>Usage of the URN namespace has been requested within the CCSDS community for various projects.</t> 

</section>
<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>No additional security considerations are relevant, other than those
   normally related with the general use and resolution of URNs. </t>
</section>
<section title="IANA Considerations">
<t>IANA has registered the "ccsds" NID within the IANA registry of URN NIDs in the "Formal URN Namespaces" subregistry.</t>
