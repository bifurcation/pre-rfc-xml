   ******** ABSTRACT ****************
-->
<abstract>
<t>Enterprise users require mobility and secure connectivity when they
roam and connect to the services offered in the enterprise. Secure
connectivity is required when the user connects to the enterprise from
an untrusted network. Mobility is beneficial when the user moves, either
inside or outside the enterprise network, and acquires a new IP
address. This document describes a solution using Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4) and
mobility extensions to IKEv2 (MOBIKE) to provide secure connectivity
and mobility.  </t></abstract>

<!--
   ******** INTRODUCTION **********
-->
<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
<t>
A typical enterprise network consists of users connecting to the
services from a trusted network (intranet), and from an untrusted
network (Internet).  The trusted and untrusted networks are
typically separated by a demilitarized zone (DMZ).  Access to the
intranet is controlled by a firewall and a Virtual Private Network (VPN) gateway in the DMZ.
</t>
<t>Enterprise users, when roaming on untrusted networks, most often
have to authenticate themselves to the VPN gateway and set up a secure
tunnel in order to access the intranet.  The use of IPsec VPNs is very
common to enable such secure connectivity to the intranet.  When the
user is on the trusted network, VPNs are not used. However, the users
benefit tremendously when session mobility between subnets, through
the use of Mobile IPv4, is available.
</t>
<t>
There has been some work done on using Mobile IPv4 and IPsec VPNs to
provide roaming and secure connectivity to an enterprise <xref
target="RFC5265"/> <xref
target="RFC4093"/>.  The solution described in <xref
target="RFC5265" /> was designed with
certain restrictions, including requiring no modifications to the VPN
gateways, and involves the use of two layers of MIPv4, with one home
agent inside the intranet and one in the Internet or in the DMZ before
the VPN gateway.  The per-packet overhead is very high in this
solution.  It is also challenging to implement and have two instances
of MIPv4 active at the same time on a mobile node.  However, the
solution described here is only applicable when Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2)
<!--[mf] Should IKEv2 be expanded here?  It's already been used in other acronyms (MOBIKE) without expansion.  -->
 IPsec VPNs are
used.
</t>
<t>
This document describes an alternate solution that does not require
two layers of MIPv4.  The solution described in this document uses
Mobile IPv4 when the mobile node is on the trusted network and
MOBIKE-capable IPsec VPNs when the mobile node is on the untrusted
network.  The mobile node uses the tunnel inner address (TIA) given
out by the IPsec VPN gateway as the co-located care-of address (CoA) for MIPv4
registration. This eliminates the need for using an external MIPv4
home agent and the need for encapsulating the VPN tunnel inside a
MIPv4 tunnel.
</t>
<t>
The following assumptions are made for the solution described in 
this document.</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>IKEv2 <xref target="RFC4306"/> and IPsec <xref
target="RFC4301"/> are used to set up the VPN tunnels
between the mobile node and the VPN gateway.
</t>
<t>The VPN gateway and the mobile node support MOBIKE extensions as
defined in <xref target="RFC4555"/>.  
</t>
<t>When the mobile node is on the trusted network, traffic should not
go through the DMZ.  Current deployments of firewalls and DMZs
consider the scenario where only a small amount of the total
enterprise traffic goes through the DMZ. Routing through the DMZ
typically involves stateful inspection of each packet by the firewalls
in the DMZ. Moreover, the DMZ architecture assumes that the DMZ is
less secure than the internal network. Therefore, the DMZ-based
architecture allows the least amount of traffic to traverse the DMZ,
that is, only traffic between the trusted network and the external
network. Requiring all normal traffic to the mobile nodes to traverse
the DMZ would negate this architecture.
</t>
<t>When the mobile node is on the trusted network and uses a wireless
access technology, confidentiality protection of the data traffic is
provided by the particular access technology.  In some networks,
confidentiality protection MAY be available between the mobile node
and the first hop access router, in which case it is not required at
layer 2.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
This document also presents a solution for the mobile node to 
detect when it is on a trusted network, so that the IPsec tunnel
can be dropped and the mobile node can use Mobile IP in the
intranet.

<!--
   ******** SOLUTION OVERVIEW *********
-->
<section anchor="solution" title="Solution Overview">
<t>
The mobile node is configured with a home address that remains the
same irrespective of whether the mobile node is inside or outside the
enterprise network. The mobile node is also reachable at the same home
address irrespective of its current point of attachment.  When the
mobile node is connected to the intranet directly, it uses Mobile IP
for internal mobility. 
</t>
<t>
When the mobile node roams and connects to an untrusted
network outside the enterprise, it sets up a VPN tunnel to the VPN
gateway. However, it still maintains a valid binding cache entry at
the i-HA. It uses the VPN-TIA, allocated by the VPN gateway, as the
co-located CoA for registration with the i-HA. If the VPN-TIA changes
or if the mobile node moves and connects to another VPN gateway, then
it sends a Registration Request to the i-HA using the new co-located
CoA. 
</t>
<t>
If the mobile node moves while outside the enterprise and its
access network changes, it uses the MOBIKE protocol to update the VPN
gateway of its current address. The internal home agent is not aware
of the mobile node's movement as long as the mobile node is attached
to the same VPN gateway and the TIA remains the same.
</t>
<t>

solution. It also shows the possible mobile node locations and access
modes.

</artwork></figure>
</t>
<t>
The solution described above results in a Mobile IP tunnel inside an
IPsec tunnel. The Mobile IP tunnel is between the mobile node and the
home agent, and the IPsec tunnel is between the mobile node (MN) and the mVPN
gateway.  The mobile node MUST reverse tunnel through the home agent <xref
target="RFC3024" /> when the Mobile IP tunnel is inside an IPsec tunnel.
</t>
<t>
The overhead of running a Mobile IP tunnel inside an IPsec tunnel can
be avoided by having the Mobile IP foreign agent functionality on the
VPN gateway.  This is out of scope for this document and is further
described in <xref target="MEGHANA"/>.
</t>
<t>
Whenever the mobile node attaches to a new link, it may encounter a
foreign agent.  The mobile node MUST not use the foreign agent care-of
address with the i-HA when attached to an untrusted access network.
The default behavior for the mobile node is to always configure an
address from the access link using DHCP. The mobile node then checks
if it is attached to a trusted access network by sending a
Registration Request to the i-HA in the co-located care-of address
mode.  If the mobile node discovers that it is attached to a trusted
access network, then it MAY start using a foreign agent care-of address
with the i-HA. In order to do this, the mobile node has to perform a
new registration with the i-HA.
</t>
<t>
The mobile node can use a foreign agent on a untrusted access network,
if there is an external home agent that the mobile node is able to
use.  The use of an external home agent in the untrusted access
network and a home agent in the trusted access network at the same
time is described in detail in <xref
target="RFC5265"/>.
</t>
<t>
Some IPsec VPN implementations allow a host to send traffic directly
to the Internet when attached to an untrusted network.  This traffic
bypasses the IPsec tunnel with the VPN gateway.  This document does
not prevent such traffic from being sent out from the host, but there
will be no mobility or session continuity for the traffic.  Any data
traffic that is sent through the Mobile IP tunnel with the home agent
is always sent through the VPN gateway.
</t>
<section title="Access Modes">
<t>The following access modes are used in the solution described in this
document.
</t>

<!--
<section title="Access Mode: 'h'">
<t>
This access mode is standard Mobile IPv4 <xref target="RFC3344" />
when the mobile node is attached to its home link. The mobile node
must detect that it is connected to home link before using this mode.
</t>
</section>
-->

<section title="Access Mode: 'c'">
<t>
This access mode is standard Mobile IPv4 <xref target="RFC3344" />
with a co-located care-of address. The mobile node must detect that it
is connected to an internal trusted network before using this mode.
The co-located care-of address is assigned by the access network to
which the mobile node is attached.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Access Mode: 'f'">
<t>
This access mode is standard Mobile IPv4 <xref target="RFC3344" />
with a foreign agent care-of address.  The mobile node can use this
mode only when it detects that it is connected to an internal trusted
network and also detects a foreign agent on the access network.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Access Mode: 'mc'">
<t>
This access mode involves using both Mobile IPv4 and a MOBIKE-enabled
IPsec VPN gateway, resulting in a Mobile IP tunnel inside an IPsec
tunnel.  The mobile node uses the VPN-TIA as the co-located CoA for
registering with the home agent.  This mode is used only when the
mobile node is attached to an untrusted network and is required to
set up an IPsec tunnel with a VPN gateway to gain access to the trusted
network.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<!--
   ******** MOBILITY WITHIN ENTERPRISE **********
-->
<section title="Mobility within the Enterprise">
<t>
When the mobile node is inside the enterprise network and attached to
the intranet, it uses Mobile IPv4 <xref target="RFC3344"/> for subnet
mobility.  The mobile node always configures a care-of address
through DHCP on the access link and uses it as the co-located care-of
address.  The mobile node MAY use a foreign agent care-of address, if
a foreign agent is available.  However, the foreign agent care-of
address is used only when the mobile node is attached to the trusted
access network.  The mobile node attempts Foreign Agent discovery and
CoA address acquisition through DHCP simultaneously in order to avoid
the delay in discovering a foreign agent when there is no foreign
agent available.  The mobile node maintains a valid binding cache
entry at all times at the home agent mapping the home address to
the current CoA.  Whenever the mobile node moves, it sends a
Registration Request to update the binding cache entry.
</t>
<t> 
The Mobile IP signaling messages between the mobile node and the home
agent are authenticated as described in <xref target="RFC3344"/>.
</t>
<t> 
The mobile node maintains a valid binding cache entry at the home agent
even when it is outside the enterprise network.
</t>
</section>

<!--
   ******** MOBILITY OUTSIDE ENTERPRISE ***********
-->
<section title="Mobility When outside the Enterprise">
<t>
When the mobile node is attached to an untrusted network, it sets up
an IPsec VPN tunnel with the VPN gateway to gain access to the
enterprise network. If the mobile node moves and its IP address
changes, it initiates the MOBIKE protocol <xref
target="RFC4555"/> to update the address on the VPN
gateway.
</t>
<t>
The mobile node maintains a binding at the home agent even when it is
outside the enterprise network.  If the TIA changes due to the mobile
node re-connecting to the VPN gateway or attaching to a different VPN
gateway, the mobile node should send a Registration Request to its
home agent to update the binding cache with the new TIA.
</t>
</section>

<!--
   ******** CROSSING SECURITY BOUNDARIES **********
-->
<section title="Crossing Security Boundaries">
<t>

Security boundary detection is based on the reachability of the i-HA
from the mobile node's current point of attachment.  Whenever the
mobile node detects a change in network connectivity, it sends a
Registration Request to the i-HA without any VPN encapsulation.  If
the mobile node receives a Registration Reply with the Trusted
Networks Configured (TNC) extension from the i-HA, then it assumes
that it is on a trusted network.  The TNC extension is described in
<xref target="RFC5265"/>. The mobile node
MUST check that the Registration Reply is integrity protected using
the mobile node-home agent mobility security association before
concluding it is attached to a trusted network. This security boundary
detection is based on the mechanism described in <xref
target="RFC5265"/> to detect attachment to
the internal trusted network.  The mobile node should re-transmit the
Registration Request if it does not receive the Registration Reply
within a timeout period. The number of times the mobile node should
re-transmit the Registration Request and the timeout period for
receiving the Registration Reply are configurable on the mobile node.

</t>
<t>
When the mobile node is attached to an untrusted network and is using
an IPsec VPN to the enterprise network, the ability to send a
Registration Request to the i-HA without VPN encapsulation would
require some interaction between the IPsec and MIPv4 modules on the
mobile node. This is local to the mobile node and out of scope for
this document.
</t>
<t>
If the mobile node has an existing VPN tunnel to its VPN gateway, it
MUST send a MOBIKE message at the same time as the registration
request to the i-HA whenever the IP address changes. If the mobile
node receives a response from the VPN gateway, but not from the i-HA,
it assumes it is outside the enterprise network.  If it receives a
response from the i-HA, then it assumes it is inside the enterprise
network.
</t>
<t>
There could also be some out-of-band mechanisms that involve
configuring the wireless access points with some information that the
mobile node can recognize as access points that belong to the trusted
network in an enterprise network.  Such mechanisms are beyond
the scope of this document.
</t>
<t>
The mobile node should not send any normal traffic while it is trying
to detect whether it is attached to the trusted or untrusted
network. This is described in more detail in <xref
target="RFC5265"/>.
</t>
<section title="Operation When Moving from an Untrusted Network">
<t>
When the mobile node is outside the enterprise network and attached to
an untrusted network, it has an IPsec VPN tunnel with its mobility
aware VPN gateway, and a valid registration with a home agent on the
intranet with the VPN-TIA as the care-of address.
</t><t>
If the mobile node moves and its IP address changes, it performs the
following steps:
</t>
<t>
<list style='hanging'>
<t hangText='1a.'>
Initiate an IKE mobility exchange to update the VPN gateway with the
current address. If the new network is also untrusted, this will be
enough for setting up the connectivity. If the new network is trusted,
and if the VPN gateway is reachable, this exchange will allow the
mobile node to keep the VPN state alive while on the trusted side. If
the VPN gateway is not reachable from inside, then this exchange will
fail.
</t>
<t hangText='1b.'>
At the same time as step 1, send a Mobile IPv4
Registration Request to the internal home agent without VPN
encapsulation.
</t>
<t hangText='2.'>
If the mobile node receives a Registration Reply to the request sent
in step 1b, then the current subnet is a trusted subnet, and the
mobile node can communicate without VPN tunneling. The mobile node MAY
tear down the VPN tunnel.
</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>
<section title="Operation When Moving from a Trusted Network">
<t>
When the mobile node is inside the enterprise and attached to the
intranet, it does not use a VPN tunnel for data traffic. It has a
valid binding cache entry at its home agent. If the VPN gateway is
reachable from the trusted network, the mobile node MAY have valid
IKEv2 security associations with its VPN gateway. The IPsec security
associations can be created when required.  The mobile node may have
to re-negotiate the IKEv2 security associations to prevent them from
expiring.
</t>
<t>
If the mobile node moves and its IP address changes, it performs the
following steps:
</t><t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>
Initiate an IKE mobility exchange to update the VPN gateway with the
current address, or if there is no VPN connection, then establish a
VPN tunnel with the gateway from the new local IP address. If the new
network is trusted, and if the VPN gateway is reachable, this exchange
will allow the mobile node to keep the VPN state alive, while in the
trusted side. If the new network is trusted and if the VPN gateway is
not reachable from inside, then this exchange will fail.
</t>
<t> 
At the same time as step 1, send a Mobile IPv4 Registration
Request to the internal home agent without VPN encapsulation.
</t>
<t>
If the mobile node receives a Registration Reply to the request
sent in step 2, then the current subnet is a trusted subnet, and the
mobile node can communicate without VPN tunneling, using only
Mobile IP with the new care-of address.
</t>
<t>
If the mobile node didn't receive the response in step 3, and if
the VPN tunnel is successfully established and registered in step 1,
then the mobile node sends a Registration Request over the VPN
tunnel to the internal home agent. After receiving a Registration
Reply from the home agent, the mobile node can start
communicating over the VPN tunnel with the Mobile IP home address.
</t>
</list>

<!--
   ******** NAT TRAVERSAL ***********
-->
<section title="NAT Traversal">
<t>
There could be a Network Address Translation (NAT) device between the mobile node and the home agent
in any of the access modes, 'c', 'f', and 'mc', and between the mobile
node and the VPN gateway in the access mode 'mc'. Mobile IPv4 NAT
traversal, as described in <xref target="RFC3519"/>, should be used by
the mobile node and the home agent in access modes 'c' or 'f', when
there is a NAT device present. When using access mode, 'mc', IPsec NAT
traversal <xref target="RFC3947"/> <xref target="RFC3948" /> should be
used by the mobile node and the VPN gateway, if there is a NAT device
present.  Typically, the TIA would be a routable address inside the
enterprise network.  But in some cases, the TIA could be from a
private address space associated with the VPN gateway.  In such a
case, Mobile IPv4 NAT traversal should be used in addition to IPsec
NAT traversal in the 'mc' mode.

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
Enterprise connectivity typically requires very strong security, and

Security concerns related to the mobile node detecting that it is on a

in <xref target="RFC5265"/>.  
</t>
<t>
When the mobile node sends a Registration Request to the i-HA from an

home address, and the Authenticator value in the authentication
extensions to the untrusted network.  This may be a concern in some

  <t>Users that need to connect to their enterprise network from an untrusted network require secure connectivity and mobility. Enterprise users are increasingly using mobile nodes. A user may need to connect to the enterprise network from anywhere, and in a number of scenarios, from untrusted networks. There are existing specifications developed by the Mobile IPv4 working group that describe solutions for enterprise secure connectivity and mobility. This document proposes optimizations to those solutions to reduce the tunneling overhead and allow for a number of new access modes.</t>

<section title="Applicability to a Mobile Operator Network">
<t>
The solution described in this document can also be applied to a
Mobile Operator's network when the Operator deploys heterogeneous
access networks and some of the access networks are considered as
trusted networks and others as untrusted networks. <xref
target="Figure 2"/> illustrates such a network topology.

<t>
An IPsec VPN gateway provides secure connectivity to the Operator's
internal network for mobile nodes attached to an untrusted access
network. The VPN gateway supports MOBIKE extensions so that the IPsec
tunnels survive any IP address change when the mobile node moves while
attached to the untrusted access networks.
</t>
<t>
When the mobile node is attached to the trusted access network, it uses
Mobile IP with the i-HA. It uses the IP address obtained from the
trusted access network as the co-located care-of address to register
with the i-HA.  If a foreign agent is available in the trusted access
network, the mobile node may use a foreign agent care-of address. If the
mobile node moves and attaches to an untrusted access network, it sets
up an IPsec tunnel with the VPN gateway to access the Operator's
internal network. It uses the IPsec TIA as the co-located care-of
address to register with the i-HA thereby creating a Mobile IP tunnel
inside an IPsec tunnel.
</t>
<t>
When the mobile node is attached to the trusted access network, it can
either be attached to a foreign link in the trusted network or to the
home link directly.  This document does not impose any restrictions.
