<abstract>
	<t>	Full use of electronic mail throughout the world requires that
	(subject to other constraints) people be able to use close
	variations on their own names (written correctly in their own
	languages and scripts) as mailbox names in email addresses.  This
	document introduces a series of specifications that define
	mechanisms and protocol extensions needed to 
	fully support internationalized email addresses.  These changes
	include an SMTP extension and extension of email header syntax to
	accommodate UTF-8 data.  The document set also includes discussion
	of key assumptions and issues in deploying fully internationalized
	email. This document is a replacement for RFC 4952; it reflects
	additional issues identified since that document was published.</t>

<!-- [Auth/JcK]: Short answer: already had this fight with the IESG.
   No, text is correct as is.
   Longer answer: as a style issue - the
   primary responsibility of the RFC Editor, not the IESG - 
   "obsoletes" statements don't belong in Abstracts unless the main
   focus of the document is to do just that.  For example, I'd expect
   to see something that amounts to "this obsoletes RFC nnnn" in the
   abstract of a document titled "Make RFC nnnn Obsolete".  You had
   better draw and hold the line on this sort of thing if you want
   to have any hope of both enforcing the 13 line rule and keeping
   abstracts meaningful. -->

	internationalize both the domain part and the local part of email
	addresses.
	The domain part of email addresses is already internationalized
	<xref target="RFC5890"/>, while the local part is not.
	Without the extensions specified in this document, the 
	mailbox name is restricted to a subset of 7-bit ASCII
	<xref target="RFC5321"/>.  Though MIME
	<xref target="RFC2045"/> enables the transport of
	non-ASCII data, it does not provide a mechanism for internationalized
	email addresses.  In <xref target="RFC2047"> RFC 2047 </xref>, MIME
	defines an encoding mechanism 
	for some specific message header fields to accommodate non-ASCII data.
	However, it does not permit the use of email addresses that include
	non-ASCII characters.
	Without the extensions defined here, or some equivalent set, the only
	way to incorporate non-ASCII characters in any part of email
	addresses is to use 
	RFC 2047 coding to embed them in what
	<xref target="RFC5322">RFC 5322</xref> calls the "display name"
	(known as a "name phrase" or by other terms elsewhere) of the relevant
	header fields. Information coded into the display name is
	invisible in the message 
	envelope and, for many purposes, is not part of the address at all.

<t>This document is a replacement for
   <xref target="RFC4952">RFC 4952</xref>; it reflects
	additional issues, shared terminology, and some architectural
	changes identified since that document was published.
    It obsoletes that document.  The experimental descriptions of
	in-transit downgrading 
	<xref target="RFC5504"/> <xref target="RFC5825"/> are now
	irrelevant and no longer needed 
	due to the changes discussed in <xref target="KeyChanges"/>.  The

  <section title="Role of This Specification" anchor="role">
	<t>
		This document presents the overview and framework for an approach to
		the next stage of email internationalization.  This new stage requires
		not only internationalization of addresses and header fields, but also
		associated transport and delivery models.  

<!-- [rfced] In the following sentence, does "experimental" refer to the status
of the RFCs or the experimental nature of the material discussed in
		those RFCs?
   [Auth/JcK]: Both, really.  Hadn't thought about this, but, if one
		wants to split hairs, probably the latter.

Original:
   A prior
   version of this specification, RFC 4952 [RFC4952], also provided an
   introduction to a series of experimental protocols [RFC5335]
   [RFC5336] [RFC5337] [RFC5504] [RFC5721] [RFC5738] [RFC5825].

If referring to the status of the RFCs, we recommend using "Experimental" 
here.  We note that the capitalized form is used in the same
		paragraph. -->
	<!-- [Auth/JcK]: As I think about it, I prefer lower-case
		"experimental" in both places to emphasize that it is about
		the nature of the earlier protocols, not their official
		status, which becomes confusing when they are reclassified to
		Historic.  I note that the second instance in this paragraph
		is the only place that "Experimental" appears in the document
		(other than in titles).  Changes made. -->

A prior version of
		this specification, <xref target="RFC4952">RFC 4952</xref>,
		also provided an introduction to a series of experimental
		protocols
		<xref target="RFC5335"/> <xref target="RFC5336"/>
		<xref target="RFC5337"/> <xref target="RFC5504"/>
		<xref target="RFC5721"/> <xref target="RFC5738"/>
		<xref target="RFC5825"/>.
		This revised form provides overview
		and conceptual information for the Standards Track successors
		of a subset of those protocols.  Details of the documents and the
		relationships among them appear in <xref target="DocPlan"/>
		and a discussion of what was learned from the experimental
		protocols and their implementations appears in
		<xref target="ExperResults"/>.
	</t>
	<t>Taken together, these specifications provide the details for a way to
		implement and support internationalized email.  The document itself
		describes how the various elements of email 
		internationalization fit together and the relationships
		among the primary specifications associated with message
		transport, header formats, and handling.
	</t>
	<t>This document, and others that comprise the collection
	   described above, assume a reasonable familiarity with the basic
	   Internet electronic mail specifications and terminology
	   <xref target="RFC5321"/> <xref target="RFC5322"/>
  <!-- [Auth:JcK] Most of the style manuals I've looked at that permit
	  a transition from "text superscript-X,superscript-Y" (rarely
	  written with intervening space) to a bracketed form ask for
	  "text[X,Y]" or "text [X,Y]" or (rarely) "text [X, Y]", not
	  "text [X] [Y]".   It seems to me that "text [X][Y]" is a better
	  approximation than putting in an intervening space, but suit
	  yourselves.
	  [[Heather, et. al, another Style Manual issue that needs an
	  authoritative position, not making up as we go along... and, of
	  course, one that interacts with any plan that might permit
	  actual superscripted text.]]  -->
	   and the MIME <xref target="RFC2045"/> and
	   8BITMIME <xref target="RFC6152"/> ones as well.  While not
	   strictly required to implement this specification, a general
	   familiarity with the terminology and functions of IDNA
	   <xref target="RFC5890"/> <xref target="RFC5891"/>
	   <xref target="RFC5892"/> <xref target="RFC5893"/>
	   <xref target="RFC5894"/> are also assumed.</t>
	</section>

   <section title="Problem Statement" anchor="problem">
	  <t>Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)
   <xref target="RFC5890"/> permits internationalized domain names,
	but deployment has not yet reached most
	users.  One of the reasons for this is that we do not yet have fully
	internationalized naming schemes.  Domain names are just one of the
	various names and identifiers that are required to be
	internationalized.  In many contexts, until more of those identifiers
	are internationalized, internationalized domain names alone have
	little value. </t>

	<t>Email addresses are prime examples of why it is not good enough to
	just internationalize the domain name.  As most observers have learned
	from experience, users strongly prefer email addresses that resemble
	names or initials to those involving seemingly meaningless strings
	of letters or numbers.  Unless the entire email address can use
	familiar characters and formats, users will perceive email as being
	culturally unfriendly.  If the names and initials used in email
	addresses can be expressed in the native languages and writing
	systems of the users, the Internet will be perceived as more natural,
	especially by those whose native language is not written in a subset
	of a Roman-derived script.</t> 

<t>Internationalization of email addresses is not merely a matter of
	changing the SMTP envelope; or of modifying the "From:", "To:", and "Cc:"
	header fields; or of permitting upgraded Mail User Agents (MUAs) to decode a
	special coding and respond by displaying local characters.  To be
	perceived as usable, the addresses must be internationalized and
	handled consistently in all of the contexts in which they occur.
	This requirement has far-reaching implications: collections of patches
	and workarounds are not adequate.  Even if they were adequate, a
	workaround-based
	approach may result in an assortment of implementations with different sets of
	patches and workarounds having been applied with consequent user
	confusion about what is actually usable and supported.
	Instead, we need to build a fully
	internationalized email environment, focusing on permitting efficient
	communication among those who share a language and writing system.
	That, in turn, implies changes to the mail header environment to
	permit those header fields that are appropriately
	internationalized to utilize the full range of Unicode characters, an
	SMTP extension to permit
<!-- [Auth/JcK]: I'm ok with your making "extension" in "SMTP
  Extension" (above and below) lower case if you think that is right,
  but please note 
  that "SMTP Extension" is the formal name of a particular class of
  things. One could reference RFC 1425 or any of its successors,
  including RFC 5321, here if one were being compulsive.  If you want
  to do so, the citation associated with 8BITMIME should go directly
  after it, not after "Extension" (sic).  Last I heard, formal names
  rated title case. -->  
	UTF-8 <xref target="RFC3629"/> <xref target="RFC5198"/>
	mail addressing and delivery of those
	extended header fields, support for internationalization of delivery
	and service notifications <xref target="RFC3461"/>
	<xref target="RFC3464"/>, and (finally) a requirement for support of the
	8BITMIME SMTP extension <xref target="RFC6152"/> so that all of these
	can be transported through the 
	mail system without having to overcome the limitation that header
	fields do not have content-transfer-encodings.</t>

</section>

  <section title="Terminology">
	<t>This document assumes a reasonable understanding of the protocols and
		terminology of the core email standards as documented in
		RFC 5321 <xref target="RFC5321"/> and RFC 5322 <xref target="RFC5322"/>.</t>
<!-- [Auth/JcK]: In the above, consider dropping the "as documented
	 in...", text, leaving "...core email standards
	 [RFC5321][RFC5322].".   I know I haven't been strictly consistent
	 about this in XML.  RFC Editor choice; I'm ok either way as long
	 as it is consistent. -->
	 
  <section title="Mail User and Mail Transfer Agents" anchor="MUA-MTAdefs">
	<t> Much of the description in this document depends on the
		abstractions of "Mail Transfer Agent" ("MTA") and "Mail User Agent"
		("MUA").  However, it is important to understand that those terms and
		the underlying concepts postdate the design of the Internet's email
		architecture and the application of the "protocols on the wire"
		principle to it. That email
		architecture, as it has evolved, and that "on the wire" principle have
		prevented any strong and standardized distinctions about how MTAs and
		MUAs interact on a given origin or destination host (or even whether
		they are separate).</t>

	  <t>However, the term "final delivery MTA" is used in this document in
		a fashion equivalent to the term "delivery system" or "final
		delivery system" of RFC 5321.  This is the SMTP server that
		controls the format of the local parts of addresses and is permitted
		to inspect and interpret them.
		It receives messages from the network for
		delivery to mailboxes or for other local processing, including any
		forwarding or aliasing that changes envelope addresses, rather than
		relaying. From the perspective 
		of the network, any local delivery arrangements such as saving to
		a message store, handoff to specific message delivery programs
		or agents, and mechanisms for retrieving messages are all "behind"
		the final delivery MTA and hence are not part of the SMTP transport or
		delivery process.</t>
    </section>

 <section title="Address Character Sets">
   <t> In
	   this document, an address is "all-ASCII", or just an "ASCII address",
	   if every character in the 
	   address is in the ASCII character repertoire <xref target="ASCII"/>;
	   an address is "non-ASCII", or an "i18n-address", if any character
	   is not in the ASCII 
	   character repertoire.  Such addresses MAY be restricted
	   in other ways, but those restrictions are not relevant to this
	   definition.
	   The term "all-ASCII" is also applied to other 
	   protocol elements when the distinction is important, with "non-ASCII"
	   or "internationalized" as its opposite.</t>

	<t>The umbrella term to describe the email address
	   internationalization specified by this document and its
	   companion documents is "&EAISMTPkeyword;".

	   For example, an address permitted by this specification is
	   referred to as a "&EAISMTPkeyword; (compliant) address".</t>
<!-- [Auth/JcK]: My style manual collection differs about whether the
	article is chosen based on the spelling of an acronym that is
	often pronounced or on the pronunciation of that acronym.  I'm ok
	with either rule, but please review whether you want 'a "SMTP..."'
	or 'an "SMTP..."' immediately above. -->
	<t>Please note that, according to the definitions given here, the
	   set of all "all-ASCII" addresses and the set of all "non-ASCII"
		addresses are mutually exclusive.  The set of all addresses
		permitted when &EAISMTPkeyword; appears is the union of these
		two sets. 
	</t>
	</section>

	<section title="User Types">
      <t> An "ASCII user" (i) exclusively uses email addresses that
		 contain ASCII 
         characters only, and (ii) cannot generate recipient addresses
		 that contain non-ASCII characters.</t>

      <t> An "internationalized email user" has one or more non-ASCII email
 <!-- [Auth/JcK]: 'i18mail' cannot possibly be right.

	paragraph? (fix applied after discussion with co-author and design
	team) -->
		 addresses, or is able to generate recipient addresses that
		 contain non-ASCII characters. Such a user may have 
         ASCII addresses too; if the user has more than one email
		 account and a corresponding address, or more than one alias for
		 the same address, he or she has
         some method to choose which address to use on outgoing email.
		 Note that under this definition, it is not possible to tell
		 from an ASCII address if the owner of that address is an
		 internationalized email user or not.  (A non-ASCII address implies a belief
		 that the owner of that address is an internationalized email user.)
		 There is no such thing as an "internationalized email user
		 message"; the term 
		 applies only to users and their agents and capabilities.  In
		 particular, the use of non-ASCII, and hence presumably
		 internationalized, message content is an
		 integral part of the
		 MIME specifications <xref target="RFC2045"/> and does not
		 require these extensions (although it is compatible with
		 them).</t>
	 </section>

	 <section title="Messages">
        <t>A "message" is sent from one user (the sender) using a
		   particular email address to one or more
		   other recipient email addresses (often referred to just as
		   "users" or "recipient users").</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Mailing Lists">
        <t>A "mailing list" is a mechanism whereby a message may be
		   distributed to multiple recipients by sending it to one
		   recipient address.  An agent (typically not a human being)
		   at that single address then causes the message to be
		   redistributed to the target recipients.  This agent sets the
		   envelope return address of the redistributed message to a
		   different address from that of the original single

   <t>An important issue with these extensions is how to handle

   If the extension is not supported by the first-hop system

   [RFC2047] in the message headers.
-->
<!-- [Auth/JcK]: "i.e.", would be better.  It should be clear to any
	  normally-skilled practitioner of email protocols, but I've fixed
	  it. -->

 If the extension is not
	  supported by the first-hop system (i.e., the SMTP server accessed by the
	  submission server acting as an SMTP client), message-originating systems
	  SHOULD be prepared to either send conventional envelopes and
	  message headers or to return the message to the originating user so the
	  message may be manually downgraded to the traditional form,
	  possibly using encoded words <xref target="RFC2047"/> in the
	  message headers.  Of course, such transformations imply that the
	  originating user or system must have ASCII-only addresses
	  available for all senders and recipients.  Mechanisms by which
	  such addresses may be found or identified are outside the scope
	  of these specifications as are decisions about the design of
	  originating systems such as whether any required
	  transformations are made by the user, the originating MUA, or
	  the submission server. </t>
   <t>A somewhat more complex situation arises when the first-hop
	  system supports these extensions but some subsequent server in
	  the SMTP transmission chain does not.  It is important to note
	  that most cases of that situation with forward-pointing
	  addresses will be the result of
	  configuration errors: especially if it hosts non-ASCII
	  addresses, a final delivery MTA that accepts these
	  extensions SHOULD NOT be configured with lower-preference MX
	  hosts that do not.  When the only non-ASCII address being
	  transmitted is backward-pointing (e.g., in an SMTP MAIL
	  command), recipient configuration cannot help in general.  On
	  the other hand, alternate, all-ASCII addresses for senders are
	  those most likely to be authoritatively known by the submission
	  environment or the sender herself.  Consequently, if an
	  intermediate SMTP relay that
	  requires these extensions then discovers that the next system in
	  the chain does not support them, it will have little choice
	  other than to reject or return the message.</t>
   <t> As discussed above, downgrading to an ASCII-only form may
	  occur before or during the initial message submission. It might
	  also occur after the delivery to the final delivery MTA in order
	  to accommodate message stores, IMAP or POP servers, or clients
	  that have different capabilities than the delivery MTA.  
	  These cases are discussed in the subsections below.</t>

<section title="Downgrading before or during Message Submission"
		anchor="DowngradeBefore">
   <t>The IETF has traditionally avoided specifying the precise behavior of
	  MUAs to provide maximum flexibility in the associated user
	  interfaces.
	  The <xref target="RFC5321">SMTP standard</xref>, Section 6.4,
	  gives wide latitude to MUAs and submission servers as to what
	  might be supplied by the user as long as the result conforms
	  with "on the wire" standards once it is injected into the public
	  Internet.  In that tradition, the discussion in the remainder of
	  <xref target="EndpointDowngrade"/> is provided as general
	  guidance rather than normative requirements.</t>
   <t>Messages that require these extensions will sometimes be transferred
		to a system that does not support these extensions; it is likely that
		the most common cases will involve the combination of ASCII-only
		forward-pointing addresses with a non-ASCII backward-pointing one.
		Until the extensions described
	  here have been universally implemented in the Internet email
	  environment, senders who prefer to use non-ASCII addresses (or
	  raw UTF-8 characters in header fields), even
	  when their intended recipients use and expect all-ASCII ones, will need to
	  be especially careful about the error conditions that can arise.
	  The risks are especially great in environments in which

   <t>Perhaps obviously, the most convenient time to find an ASCII
	  address corresponding to an internationalized address is at the
      originating MUA or closely associated systems.  This can occur
	  either before the message is  
	  sent or after the internationalized form of the message is
	  rejected.  It is also the most convenient time to convert a
	  message from the internationalized form into conventional ASCII
	  form or to generate a non-delivery message to the sender if
	  either is necessary.     At that point, the user has a full range of
	  choices available, including changing backward-pointing
	  addresses, contacting the intended recipient
	  out of band for an alternate address, consulting appropriate
	  directories, arranging for translation of both addresses and
	  message content into a different language,
	  and so on.  While it is natural to think of message downgrading as
	  optimally being a fully automated process, we should not
	  underestimate the capabilities of a user of at least moderate
	  intelligence who wishes to communicate with another such
	  user.</t>
   <t>In this context, one can easily imagine modifications to message
	  submission servers (as described in
	  <xref target="RFC6409">RFC 6409</xref>) so that they would
	  perform downgrading operations or perhaps even upgrading ones.
	  Such operations would permit
	  receiving messages with one or more of the internationalization
	  extensions discussed here and adapting the outgoing message, as
	  needed, to respond to the delivery or next-hop environment the
	  submission server encounters. </t>

	  that "due to a long history of problems when intermediate hosts

   <t>One of the reasons for this rule has to do with legacy email

			normalization reasons) in non-ASCII strings, backspace MUST
			NOT appear in SMTPUTF8 mailbox names. </t>

	  <t> For the particular case of mailbox names that contain
		 non-ASCII characters in the local part, domain part, or both, special
		 attention MUST be paid to Unicode normalization
		 <xref target="Unicode-UAX15"/>, in part
		 because Unicode strings may be normalized by other processes
		 independent of what a mail protocol specifies (this is
		 exactly analogous to what may happen with quoting and
		 dequoting in traditional addresses).  Consequently, the
		 following principles are offered as advice to those who are
		 selecting names for mailboxes:</t>
	  <t><list style="symbols">
		 <t>In general, it is wise to support addresses in Normalized
			form, using at least Normalization Form NFC. Except in
			circumstances in which NFKC would map characters together that the
			parties responsible for the destination mail server would
			prefer to be kept distinguishable, supporting the
			NFKC-conformant form would yield even more predictable
			behavior for the typical user.  </t>
		 <t>It will usually be wise to support other forms of the same
			local-part string, either as aliases or by normalization
			of strings reaching the delivery server: the sender should
			not be depended upon to send the strings in normalized
			form.</t>
		 <t>Stated differently and in more specific terms, the rules
			of the protocol for local-part strings essentially
			provide that: 
			<list style="symbols">
			   <t>Unnormalized strings are valid, but sufficiently
				  bad practice that they may not work reliably on a
				  global basis.  Servers should not depend on clients
				  to send normalized forms but should be aware that
				  procedures on client machines outside the control of
				  the MUA may cause normalized strings to be sent
				  regardless of user intent.</t>
			   <t>C0 (and presumably C1) controls (see The Unicode
				  Standard <xref target="Unicode"/>) are
				  prohibited, the first in RFC 5321 and 
				  the second by an obvious extension
				  from it <xref target="RFC5198"/>.</t>
			   <t>Other kinds of punctuation, spaces, etc., are risky
				  practice. Perhaps they will work, and SMTP receiver
				  code is required to handle them without severe
				  errors (even if such strings are not accepted in
				  addresses to be delivered on that server), but creating
				  dependencies on them in mailbox names that are
				  chosen is usually a bad practice and may lead to
				  interoperability problems. </t>

		<section title="Additional Issues">
		   <t>This section identifies issues that are not covered, or
			  not covered comprehensively, as part of this
			  set of specifications, but that will require ongoing review as
			  part of deployment of email address and header
			  internationalization.</t>

		<section title="Impact on URIs and IRIs">
		   <t>The mailto: schema <xref target="RFC6068"/>,
			  and the discussion of it in the Internationalized Resource
			  Identifier (IRI) specification <xref target="RFC3987"/>,
			  may need to be modified when this work is completed and
			  standardized.</t>
		</section>

        <section title="Use of Email Addresses as Identifiers"
		     anchor="AddrIdent">
           <t>There are a number of places in contemporary Internet
			  usage in which email addresses are used as identifiers
			  for individuals, 
			  including as identifiers to Web servers supporting some
			  electronic commerce sites and in some X.509
			  certificates <xref target="RFC5280"/>.  These documents do not address those
			  uses, but it is reasonable to expect that some difficulties will
			  be encountered when internationalized addresses are first used
			  in those contexts, many of which cannot even handle the full range of
			  addresses permitted today. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Encoded Words, Signed Messages, and Downgrading"
			anchor="BadSig">
		   <t>One particular characteristic of the email format is its
			  persistency:
 <!-- [Auth/JcK]: I'm not quite sure how "persistency" crept in here;
	many dictionaries treat it is obsolescent.  RFC Editor choice as
	to whether to replace it with "persistence".  -->
			  MUAs are expected to handle messages that were
			  originally sent decades ago and not just those delivered
 <!-- [Auth/JcK]:  RFC Editor: Do you prefer "just" or "only" above?  I'm tending
	toward "only", but your choice. -->
			  seconds ago.  As such, MUAs and mail filtering software, such
			  as that specified in Sieve <xref target="RFC5228"/>,
			  will need to continue to accept and decode header fields
			  that use the "encoded word" mechanism
			  <xref target="RFC2047"/> to accommodate non-ASCII characters in
			  some header fields.  While extensions to both
			  <xref target="RFC1939">POP3</xref> and
			  <xref target="RFC3501">IMAP</xref> have been
			  defined that include automatic upgrading of messages
			  that carry non-ASCII information in encoded form --
			  including RFC 2047 decoding -- of messages by 
			  the POP3 <xref target="RFC5721bis-POP3"/> or
			  IMAP <xref target="RFC5738bis-IMAP"/> server, there are
			  message structures and MIME 
			  content-types for which that cannot be done or where the change
			  would have unacceptable side effects.</t>
	       <t>For example, message parts that are cryptographically
			  signed, using e.g., S/MIME <xref target="RFC5751"/>
			  or Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) <xref target="RFC3156"/>,
			  cannot be upgraded from the RFC 2047 form to normal UTF-8 characters
			  without breaking the signature.  Similarly,
			  message parts that are encrypted may contain, when
			  decrypted, header fields that 
			  use the RFC 2047 encoding; such messages cannot be 'fully'
			  upgraded without access to cryptographic keys.</t>
		   <t> Similar issues may arise if messages are signed and then
			  subsequently downgraded, e.g., as discussed in
			  <xref target="DowngradeBefore"/>, and then
			  an attempt is made to upgrade them to the original form and then 
			  verify the signatures.   Even the very subtle changes
			  that may result from 
			  algorithms to downgrade and then upgrade again may be sufficient
			  to invalidate the signatures if they impact either the primary or
			  MIME body part headers.  When signatures are present, downgrading
			  must be performed with extreme care if at all. </t>

		may need to be updated to deal with these situations.</t>

	 <section title="Other Uses of Local Parts">
		<t>Local parts are sometimes used to construct domain labels,
			e.g.,  the local part "user" in the address
			user@domain.example could be converted into a host name
			user.domain.example with its Web space at
			&lt;http://user.domain.example&gt; and the catch-all addresses
			any.thing.goes@user.domain.example.</t>

			<t> Such schemes are obviously limited by, among
			   other things, the SMTP rules for domain names, and will
			   not work without further restrictions for 
			other local parts.
			Whether those limitations are relevant to these specifications is
			an open question.  It may be simply another case of
			the considerable flexibility accorded to delivery
			MTAs in determining the mailbox names they will
			accept and how they are interpreted.</t>

	 <section title="Non-Standard Encapsulation Formats">

   <section title="Key Changes from the Experimental Protocols and Framework"
		anchor="KeyChanges">

	  <t> The original framework for internationalized email addresses
		 and headers was described in RFC 4952 and a subsequent set of
		 experimental protocol documents.  Those relationships are
		 described in <xref target="problem"/>.
		 The key architectural difference between the
		 experimental specifications and this newer set is that the earlier
		 specifications supported in-transit downgrading.  Those
		 mechanisms included the
		 definition of syntax and functions to support passing alternate,
		 all-ASCII addresses with the non-ASCII ones as well as special
		 headers to indicate the downgraded status of messages.
		 Those features were
		 eliminated after experimentation indicated that they were
		 more complex and less necessary than had been assumed
		 earlier.  Those issues are described in more detail
		 in Sections
		 <xref target="ExperResults" format="counter"/> and
		 <xref target="DowngradeTransit" format="counter" />.</t>
    </section>
<!--
   <section title="IANA Considerations">
	<t> This overview description and framework document does not
		contemplate any IANA registrations or 
		other actions.  Some of the documents in the group have their own IANA
		considerations sections and requirements.</t>
   </section>
-->
   <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
	<t> Any expansion of permitted characters and encoding forms in email
		addresses raises some risks.  There have been discussions on so called
		"IDN-spoofing" or "IDN homograph attacks".  These attacks allow an
		attacker (or "phisher") to 
		spoof the domain or URLs of businesses or other entities. The
		same kind of attack is also 
		possible on the local part of internationalized email addresses. It
		should be noted that the proposed fix involving forcing all displayed
		elements into normalized lowercase works for domain names in URLs,
		but not for email local parts since those are case sensitive.
	</t>

	<t>Since email addresses are often transcribed from business cards and
	notes on paper, they are subject to problems arising from confusable
	characters (see <xref target="RFC4690"/>).  These problems are somewhat
	reduced if the domain 
	associated with the mailbox is unambiguous and supports a relatively
	small number of mailboxes whose names follow local system
	  conventions. They are increased with very large mail systems in which users can
	freely select their own addresses.</t>

	<t>The internationalization of email addresses and message headers must not leave
		the Internet less secure than it is without the required
		extensions.  The requirements and mechanisms documented in this set of
		specifications do not, in general, raise any new security
		issues.</t>
	 <t>They do require a review of issues associated with confusable
		characters -- a topic that 
		is being explored thoroughly elsewhere
		(see, e.g., <xref target="RFC4690">RFC 4690</xref>)
		-- and, potentially, some issues with UTF-8 normalization,
		discussed in <xref target="RFC3629">RFC 3629</xref>, and
		other transformations. 
		Normalization and other issues associated with transformations and
		standard forms are also part of the subject of work
		described elsewhere <xref target="RFC5198"/>
		<xref target="RFC5893"/> <xref target="RFC6055"/>.</t>
	 <t>Some issues specifically related to internationalized addresses
		and message headers are discussed in more detail in
		the other documents in this set.  However, in particular, caution
		should be taken that any "downgrading" mechanism, or use of downgraded
		addresses, does not inappropriately assume authenticated bindings
		between the internationalized and ASCII addresses.
		This potential problem can be mitigated somewhat by
		enforcing the expectation that most or all such transformations will
		be performed prior to final delivery by systems that are presumed to
		be under the administrative control of the sending user (as opposed to
		being performed in transit by entities that are not under the
		administrative control of the sending user).</t>
		<!-- Expecting most or all such transformations prior to final delivery
		be done by systems that are presumed to be under the
		administrative control of the sending user ameliorates the
		potential problem somewhat as compared to what it would be if
		the relationships were changed in transit. -->
	 <!-- <t>  "Downgrading" poses another special problem and
		risk. Any system that transforms one address or set of mail
		header fields into another becomes a point at which spoofing
		attacks can occur and those who wish to spoof messages might be
		able to do so by imitating a message downgraded from one with a
		legitimate original address. </t>  -->

	  <t> The new UTF-8 header and message formats might also raise, or
		 aggravate, another known issue.  If the model creates new forms
		 of an 'invalid' or 
		'malformed' message, then a new email attack is created:
		in an effort to be robust, some or most agents will
		accept such messages and interpret them as if they were
		well-formed.  If a filter interprets such a message
		differently than the MUA used by the recipient, then it may be possible
		to create a message that appears acceptable under the
		filter's interpretation but that should be rejected under
		the interpretation given to it by that MUA.  Such attacks
		already have occurred for existing messages and encoding layers, e.g.,
		invalid MIME syntax, invalid HTML markup, and invalid coding of
		particular image types. </t>
	<t>In addition, email addresses are used in many contexts other than
		sending mail, such as for identifiers under various circumstances
		(see <xref target="AddrIdent"/>).
		Each of those contexts will need to be evaluated, in turn, to
		determine whether the use of non-ASCII forms is appropriate and what
		particular issues they raise.</t>
	<t>This work will clearly affect any systems or mechanisms that are
	   dependent on digital signatures or similar integrity protection for
	   email message headers
	   (see also the discussion in <xref target="BadSig"/>).
	   Many conventional uses of PGP and S/MIME are not 
	   affected since they are used to sign body parts but not message
	   headers.
	   On the other hand, the developing work on DomainKeys Identified
	   Mail (DKIM) <xref target="RFC5863"/> will eventually need
	   to consider this work, and vice versa:  while this specification does
	   not address or solve the issues raised by DKIM and other
	   signed header mechanisms, the issues will have to be coordinated
	   and resolved eventually if the two sets of protocols are to
	   coexist.  In addition, to the degree to which email
	   addresses appear in PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)
	   certificates <xref target="RFC5280"/>, standards addressing such 
	   certificates will need to be upgraded to address these
	   internationalized addresses.  Those upgrades will need to address
	   questions of spoofing by look-alikes of the addresses
	   themselves. </t>
