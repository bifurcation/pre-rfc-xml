    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies requirements for a for a Network
Address Translator (NAT) and a Network Address Port Translator (NAPT)
that support Any Source IP Multicast or Source-Specific IP
Multicast. An IP multicast-capable NAT device that adheres to the
requirements of this document can optimize the operation of IP
multicast applications that are generally unaware of IP multicast NAT
devices.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

    <section title="Introduction ">
      <t>In order for IP multicast applications to function well over NATs,
      multicast UDP must work as seamlessly as unicast UDP. However, NATs have
      little consistency in IP multicast operation, which results in
      inconsistent user experiences and failed IP multicast operation.</t>

      <t>This document targets requirements intended to enable correct
      operations of Any Source Multicast and Source-Specific Multicast in devices
      running Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) proxy routing and NAT and without applying NAT to IP
      multicast group addresses. This profile of functionality is the expected
      best practice for residential access routers, small branch routers, or
      similar deployments.</t>

      <t>Most of the principles outlined in this document do also apply when
      using protocols other than IGMP, such as Protocol Independent
   Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM), or when performing NAT
      between multiple "inside" interfaces, but explicit consideration for
      these cases is outside the scope of this document.</t>

      <t>This document describes the behavior of a device that functions as a
      NAT for unicast flows and also forwards IP multicast traffic in either
      direction ('inside' to 'outside', or 'outside' to 'inside'). This allows
      a host 'inside' the NAT to both receive multicast traffic and to source
      multicast traffic. Hosts on the 'inside' interface(s) of a NAT indicate
      their interest in receiving an IP multicast flow by sending an IGMP
      message to their local interface. An IP multicast-capable NAT will see
      that IGMP message (<xref target="RFC1112">IGMPv1</xref>, <xref
      target="RFC2236">IGMPv2</xref>, <xref target="RFC3376">IGMPv3</xref>),
      possibly perform some functions on that IGMP message, and forward it to
      its upstream router. This causes the upstream router to send that IP
      multicast traffic to the NAT, which forwards it to those 'inside'
      segment(s) with host(s) that had previously sent IGMP messages for that
      IP multicast traffic.</t>

      <t>Out of scope of this document are <xref
      target="RFC4601">PIM-SM</xref> and <xref target="RFC2460">IPv6</xref>.
      The IGMP Proxy devices that are scoped in this document do not forward
      PIM-SM. IPv6 is out of scope because NAT is not considered necessary
      with IPv6.</t>

      <t>This document is a companion document to <xref target="RFC4787">"NAT
      Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"</xref>.</t>

    <section title="Terminology Used in This Document">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

      <t>In this document, the term "NAT" applies to both Network Address and
      Port Translator (NAPT) as well as a NAT that does not translate
      ports.</t>

      <t>The term 'inside' refers to the interface(s) on a NAT that contain
      hosts that wish to source or receive IP multicast traffic. The term
      'outside' refers to the interface(s) that the NAT forwards IGMP membership
      messages to, and where the NAT routes IP multicast traffic that
      originates from hosts on its 'inside' interface.</t>

    <section title="Background">
      <figure anchor="without_nat" title="Network without NATing IGMP Proxy">
        <preamble>When a NAT isn't used, a host might be connected to the
        Internet in a configuration such as this:</preamble>

      <t>If instead of a single host as shown in <xref

      hosts are to be connected, with the same type of service termination on

      target="with_nat"></xref>. This device, in general, perform routing and
      NAT functions such that it does look like a single host towards the
      DSL/cable modem.</t>

      <t>In IP multicast, IGMP is the protocol used by hosts, such as the one
      shown in <xref target="without_nat"></xref>. For the NAT device in <xref
      target="with_nat"></xref> to look like the single host for IP multicast
      services towards the DSL/cable modem and to forward IP multicast traffic
      from and to the multiple hosts in the picture, it needs to perform so
      called <xref target="RFC4605">"IGMP Proxying"</xref> -- but within the
      context of also performing NAT. NAT is not covered by <xref
      target="RFC4605"></xref>. Adding NAT to IGMP proxying does not need to
      change the processing of the IGMP messages as defined in RFC 4605: <list
          style="empty">
          <t>IGMP messages are never logically forwarded by the IGMP proxying
          device, but rather sourced or received by it. In general, receipt of
          IGMP messages by the device updates the device's IGMP state. The
          updated state changes the device's forwarding of multicast messages
          or triggers the sending of IGMP messages. "Forwarding" of IGMP
          protocol messages may thus only happen implicitly by implementation
          optimizations that create shortcuts in this machinery.</t>
        </list>This specifically means that IGMP protocol packets sent by the
      NAT device will always use the IP address of the interface ('inside' or
      'outside') from which they are sent, but because those packets are logically
      "sourced" and not "forwarded", NAT does not have any impact on
      this.</t>

      <t>Unlike unicast flows, packets with a multicast destination IP address
      do not have their destination IP address or destination port changed by
      a NAT. However, their source IP address (and source UDP port, in some
      cases with a NAPT) is changed if the packet goes from an 'inside'
      interface of a NAT to the 'outside' interface of a NAT -- similar to the
      behavior of a unicast packet across those same interfaces.</t>

      <t>Adding NAT to IGMP proxying changes the processing of IP
      multicast data packets forwarded across the IGMP proxying device as
      described in the following sections. These changes actually simplify
      the ability to deploy IGMP proxying over a device that does *not* perform
      NAT.</t>

      <t>With an IGMP Proxy NAT Device, IP multicast data traffic sourced from
      hosts on the 'inside' is NATed such that it will look like it is being sourced
      from a host directly connected to the WAN router, thus eliminating all
      non-standard PIM-SM concerns/configurations described in Section 3.2 of
      <xref target="RFC4605"></xref>.</t>

                  for its IP multicast mappings as well as for its unicast UDP
                  mappings. This allows a multicast source to discover the

          a NAT were to interleave reports from two or more reporters (joining

        <t>Any Source Multicast (ASM) uses the IP addresses in the 224/8
        through 231/8, and 233/8 through 239/8 range <xref
        target="IANA-ALLOC"></xref>.</t>

        <t>When a host both receives an ASM stream and sends traffic into it,
        using <xref target="RFC3550">RTP</xref>, there is a potential problem
        if a NAT merely followed the requirements of <xref
        target="RFC4787"></xref>. The problem is that RTP uses the source
        transport address (source IP address and source UDP port) and the
        Real-time Transport Protocol / RTP Control Protocol (RTP/RTCP) SSRC value to identify session members. If a session member
        sees the same SSRC arrive from a different transport address, that
        session member will perform RTP collision detection (Section 8.2 of
        <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>). If a NAT merely followed the
        requirements of <xref target="RFC4787"></xref> and timed out a UDP
        session after 2 minutes of inactivity and RTCP receiver reports are
        sent less often than every 2 minutes, RTP collision detection would be
        performed by other session members sharing the same SSRC, complicating
        diagnostic tools and potentially interfering with jitter buffer
        algorithms. This situation can occur, for example, with an IP
        multicast group of approximately 300 members with a normal 50 Kbps
        audio RTP stream.</t>

        <t>Source-Specific Multicast does not need this long timer because
        application feedback reports are unicast (rather than IP multicast)
        and identifiers, rather than IP addresses and UDP ports, are used to
        identify a specific IP multicast receiver (e.g., <xref
        target="RTCPSSM"></xref>.</t>

            <t>If a host on the 'inside' interface of a NAT belongs to an Any
            Source Multicast host group and the host sends a UDP packet to
            the same group, the NAT SHOULD have a UDP mapping timer of 60
            minutes for that mapping. <list hangIndent="1" style="format %c:">

                discouraged. Note that even in a situation with resource
                exhaustion, a NAT is still required to follow the minimum

      <t><list counter="req_summary" style="format REQ-%d:">
          <t>For IP multicast packets that are forwarded to a host(s) on its
          'inside' interface(s), a NAT MUST NOT modify the destination IP
          address or destination port of the packets.</t>

          <t>A NAT MUST forward IP multicast UDP datagrams from its 'outside'
          interface to multicast receivers on its 'inside'
          interface(s).</t>

          <t>A NAT SHOULD forward IP multicast non-UDP protocols (e.g., <xref

          from its 'outside' interface to IP multicast receivers on its 'inside'
          interface(s).</t>

          <t>A NAT MUST modify the source IP address of packets that arrive
          from an 'inside' interface towards the 'outside' interface so that
          those packets use the NAT's 'outside' IP address(es). <list
              style="format %c:">
              <t>If the NAT also performs port translation (that is, it is a
              NAPT), the NAT MUST also create a mapping to allow responses to
              that IP multicast packet to be received by the appropriate host.
              For Any Source Multicast, also see <xref
              target="extend_refresh"></xref>.</t>

              <t>To allow hosts to learn the NAT's 'outside' interface
              address, the NAT MUST have "Endpoint-Independent Mapping"
              behavior (REQ-1 of <xref target="RFC4787"></xref>), no matter if
              the destination IP address is a unicast address or an IP
              multicast address.</t>

              <t>If the NAT has multiple public IP addresses, the NAT SHOULD
              have an address pooling behavior of "Paired" (as described in
              Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC4787"></xref>) for its IP
              multicast mappings as well as for its unicast UDP mappings.
              This allows a multicast source to discover the
                  NAT's public IP address using a unicast address discovery
                  mechanism (e.g., <xref target="ICE"></xref>)
                  and communicate that discovered IP address to a multicast
                  receiver.</t>

            </list></t>

          <t>A NAT MUST forward IP multicast UDP datagrams from its 'inside'
          interface(s) to its 'outside' interface. <list hangIndent="1"
              style="format %c:">
                  <t>NATs that support the above requirement MUST also provide a 
        configuration option to disable this feature.  Otherwise, a 
        multihomed network would cause duplicate instances of the 
        multicast data traffic on the public network.</t>

              <t>The NAT's default configuration MUST NOT forward administratively scoped IP multicast
              traffic (239.0.0.0/8) <xref target="RFC2365"></xref> from its
              'inside' interface(s) to its 'outside' interface.</t>


<t>The NAT MUST NOT forward <xref target="RFC3171">Local Network Control Block (224.0.0/24)</xref> (also known as "link-local multicast") traffic from 
its 'inside' interface(s) to its 'outside' interface.</t>



          <t>A NAT MAY support IGMPv1 (although IGMPv1 is considered
          obsolete).</t>

          <t>A NAT MUST support IGMPv2.</t>

          <t>A NAT SHOULD support IGMPv3.</t>

          <t>If a NAT supports IGMPv1 and/or IGMPv2 (but not IGMPv3), the NAT
          MAY simply receive IGMP membership reports on the 'inside' interface,
          NAT them, and relay the IGMP membership report, and do the same
          function in the opposite direction to the IGMP listeners. That is,
          the NAT does not need to do any aggregation of IGMP messages.<list
              style="format %c:">
              <t>If a NAT relays IGMPv1 or IGMPv2 messages in this manner, it
              MUST NOT decrement the TTL of the IGMP messages, as they are
              already sent with TTL=1.</t>

              <t>However, it is RECOMMENDED that such a NAT implement <xref
              target="RFC4605">IGMP/MLD Proxying</xref>, because IGMP
              aggregation provides a useful optimization.</t>

          <t>If a NAT supports IGMPv3, the NAT MUST implement <xref
          target="RFC4605">IGMP/MLD Proxying</xref>. Such compliance causes
          the NAT to aggregate the IGMPv3 membership reports and report only
          the aggregated information upstream.</t>

              <t>If a NAT supports IGMPv3, the NAT MUST implement <xref
              target="RFC4607">Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) for IP</xref> and
              <xref target="RFC4604">IGMPv3/MLDv2 for SSM</xref>.</t>

          <t>If a host on the 'inside' interface of a NAT belongs to an Any
          Source Multicast host group and the host sends a UDP packet to the
          same group, the NAT SHOULD have a UDP mapping timer of 60 minutes

              <t>If a NAT has exhausted its resources, the NAT MAY time out

              discouraged. Note that even in a situation with resource
              exhaustion, a NAT is still required to follow the minimum

      <t>The Security Considerations sections of <xref

      Proxying</xref> apply to a device complying with this document.</t>

      <t>When a host is using RTP and participating in an Any Source
      Multicast session, the host's periodic RTCP receiver reports cause the
      NAT to create a mapping. When the group size is less than approximately
      300, the RTCP reports are sent frequently enough that a NAT's mapping
      will always be kept open. When the group size is larger than
      approximately 300, the RTCP reports are sent less frequently. The
      recommendation in <xref target="extend_refresh"></xref> causes the NAT
      mapping to be kept open for the duration of the host's participation in
      that IP multicast session no matter the size of the multicast host or
      periodicity of the host's RTCP transmissions.</t>

<abstract><t>This document specifies an extension to the Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) to use unicast feedback to a multicast sender. The proposed extension is useful for single-source multicast sessions such as Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) communication where the traditional model of many-to-many group communication is either not available or not desired. In addition, it can be applied to any group that might benefit from a sender-controlled summarized reporting mechanism. Ott et al.

    <section anchor="app_considerations" title="Application Considerations">
      <t>SSM requires listeners to know the SSM channel (S,G), which is
      comprised of the IP source address (S) and the IP multicast group (G).
      An SSM source needs to communicate its IP address in its SSM session
      establishment message (e.g., in its Session Description Protocol (SDP)
<xref target="RFC4566"></xref>). When the SSM sender is behind
      a NAT and the SSM receiver(s) are on the other side of that NAT, the SSM
      sender will need to determine its IP source address relevant to the SSM
      receivers; generally, this will be the 'outside' IP address of the NAT.
      This 'outside' address needs to be included in the SSM session
      establishment message (e.g., SDP) so that listeners on the 'outside' of
      the NAT can receive the SSM channel.</t>

      <t>If there are SSM listeners on both the 'outside' and 'inside' of the
      NAT, it may be valuable to consider using <xref
      target="ICE">ICE</xref> in the session advertisement;
      the full scope of the interaction between SSM and ICE is beyond the
      scope of this document.</t>

      <t>If multiple SSM sources on the 'inside' of a NAT choose the same
      multicast group address, those sources are uniquely identifiable because
      their IP addresses are unique. However, if their multicast traffic is
      NATed and sent on the NAT's public interface, the traffic from those
      individual sources is no longer uniquely identifiable. This will cause
      problems for multicast receivers, which will see an intermixing of
      traffic from those sources. Resolution of this issue is left for future
      study. In the meantime, applications that source SSM multicast traffic
      are encouraged to allow the user to modify the multicast SSM address so
      that users can avoid this problem if that application is placed behind a
      NAT.</t>

      <t>A multicast source that wants its traffic to not traverse a router
      (e.g., leave a home network) may find it useful to send traffic with IP
      TTL=1. Both ASM and SSM sources may find this useful.</t>

<t>As many NATs use the same private address space 
  (e.g., 192.168.0.0/16, <xref target="RFC1918"></xref>), RTP stacks are 
  encouraged to generate CNAMEs properly (see end of Section 6.5.1
  of <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>.)
