    <abstract><t>This document describes ways to prevent the use of

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Recently, DNS <xref target="RFC1034"/> has been named as a
      major factor in the generation of massive amounts of network
      traffic used in Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. These attacks,
      called reflector attacks, are not due to any particular flaw in
      the design of the DNS or its implementations, aside perhaps the
      fact that DNS relies heavily on UDP, the easy abuse of which is
      at the source of the problem. The attacks have preferentially used DNS
      due to common default configurations that allow for easy use of
      open recursive nameservers that make use of such a default
      configuration.</t>

<!--[rfced] Is it okay to replace "aside perhaps the fact" above with
"except that DNS relies..." -->

      <t>In addition, due to the small query-large response potential
      of the DNS system, it is easy to yield great amplification of the
      source traffic as reflected traffic towards the victims.</t>

      <t>DNS authoritative servers that do not provide recursion to
      clients can also be used as amplifiers; however, the
      amplification potential is greatly reduced when authoritative
      servers are used. It is also impractical to restrict access to
      authoritative servers to a subset of the Internet, since their
      normal operation relies on them being able to serve a wide
      audience; hence, the opportunities to mitigate the scale of
      an attack by modifying authoritative server configurations are
      limited. This document's recommendations are concerned with
      recursive nameservers only.</t>

      <t>In this document we describe the characteristics of the
      attack and recommend DNS server configurations that specifically
      alleviate the problem described, while pointing to the only
      real solution: the wide-scale deployment of ingress
      filtering to prevent use of spoofed IP addresses <xref
      target="BCP38"/>.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Problem Description">
      <t>Because most DNS traffic is stateless by design, an attacker
      could start a DoS attack in the following way:</t>
      
      <t><list style='numbers'>

	<t>The attacker starts by configuring a record on any zone he
	has access to, normally with large RDATA and Time to Live (TTL).</t>

<?rfc needLines="4"?>
	<t>Taking advantage of clients on non-BCP38 networks, the
	attacker then crafts a query using the source address of their
	target victim and sends it to an open recursive
	nameserver.</t>

	<t>Each open recursive nameserver proceeds with the
	resolution, caches the record, and finally sends it to the
	target. After this first lookup, access to the authoritative
	nameservers is normally no longer necessary. The record will
	remain cached at the open recursive nameserver for the duration of the TTL, even if it's deleted from the zone.</t>

	<t>Cleanup of the zone might, depending on the implementation
	used in the open recursive nameserver, afford a way to clean
	the cached record from the open recursive nameserver. This
	would possibly involve queries luring the open recursive
	nameserver to lookup information for the same name that is
	being used in the amplification.</t>
      </list></t>
      
      <t>Because the characteristics of the attack normally involve a
      low volume of packets amongst all the kinds of actors besides
      the victim, it's unlikely any one of them would notice their
      involvement based on traffic pattern changes.</t>


      <t>Taking advantage of an open recursive nameserver that supports
      EDNS0 <xref target="RFC2671"/>, the amplification factor
      (response packet size / query packet size) could be around
      80. With this amplification factor, a relatively small army of
      clients and open recursive nameservers could generate gigabits
      of traffic towards the victim.</t>

      <t>With the increasing length of authoritative DNS responses
      derived from deployment of DNS Security (DNSSEC) <xref target="RFC4033"/> and Naming
      Authority Pointer (NAPTR) as used in ENUM
      services, authoritative servers will eventually be more useful
      as actors in this sort of amplification attack.</t>
      
      <t>Even if this amplification attack is only possible due to
      non-deployment of BCP38, it is easier to
      leverage because of historical reasons.  When the
      Internet was a much closer-knit community, some nameserver
      implementations were made available with default
      configurations that, when used for recursive nameservers, made the
      server accessible to all hosts on the Internet.</t>

      <t>For years this was a convenient and helpful configuration,
      enabling wider availability of services. As this document aims
      to make apparent, it is now much better to be conscious of one's
      own nameserver services and focus the delivery of services on
      the intended audience of those services -- be they a university
      campus, an enterprise, or an ISP's customers. The target audience
      also includes operators of small networks and private server
      managers who decide to operate nameservers with the aim of
      optimising their DNS service, as these are more likely to use
      default configurations as shipped by implementors.</t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="Recommended Configuration">
      <t>In this section we describe the Best Current Practice for
      operating recursive nameservers. Following these recommendations
      would reduce the chances of any given recursive nameserver
      being used for the generation of an amplification attack.</t>

      <t>The generic recommendation to nameserver operators is to use
      the means provided by the implementation of choice to provide
      recursive name lookup service to only the intended
      clients. Client authorization can usually be done in several
      ways:</t>
      <t><list style='symbols'>
	<t>IP address based authorization. Use the IP source address
	of the DNS queries and filter them through an Access Control
	List (ACL) to service only the intended clients. This is
	easily applied if the recursive name server's service area is
	a reasonably fixed IP address range that is protected against
	external address spoofing, usually the local network.</t>
      </list></t>
      <t><list style='symbols'>
	<t>Incoming interface based selection. Use the incoming interface
	for the query as a discriminator to select which clients are to be
	served. This is of particular applicability for Small Office,
	Home Office (SOHO) devices, such
	as broadband routers that include embedded recursive name
	servers.</t>
<!--[rfced] Please verify that the above expansion of SOHO correct. -->
      </list></t>
      <t><list style='symbols'>
	  <t>Use TSIG <xref target="RFC2845"/> or SIG(0)
	    <xref target="RFC2931"/> signed queries to authenticate the
	    clients. This is a less error prone method that allows
	    server operators to provide service to clients who change IP
	    address frequently (e.g., roaming clients). The current
	    drawback of this method is that very few stub resolver
	    implementations support TSIG or SIG(0) signing of outgoing
	    queries.  The effective use of this method implies, in most
	    cases, running a local instance of a caching nameserver or
	    forwarder that will be able to TSIG sign the queries and send
	    them on to the recursive nameserver of choice.</t>
      </list></t>
      <t><list style='symbols'>
	<t>For mobile users, use a local caching name server running on
	the mobile device or use a Virtual Private Network to a
	trusted server.</t>
      </list></t>

<!--[rfced] Let us know if you'd like to change the opening sentences
  of the last two points in order to maintain style consistency with the first two
  points. For example:
  "TSIG [RFC2845] or SIG(0) [RFC2931] signed queries to authenticate the clients" (deleting
  the first "use") and "Mobile users. Use a local caching name server..." -->

<?rfc needLines="5"?>
      <t>In nameservers that do not need to be providing recursive
      service, for instance servers that are meant to be authoritative
      only, turn recursion off completely. In general, it is a good
      idea to keep recursive and authoritative services separate as
      much as practical.  This, of course, depends on local
      circumstances.</t>

      <t>Even with all these recommendations, network operators should
      consider deployment of ingress filtering <xref target="BCP38"/>
      in routers to prevent use of address spoofing as a viable course
      of action. In situations where more complex network setups are
      in place, "Ingress Filtering for Multihomed Network" <xref
      target="BCP84"/> maybe a useful additional reference.</t>

      <t>By default, nameservers SHOULD NOT offer recursive service to
      external networks.</t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document does not create any new security issues for the
	DNS protocol, it deals with a weakness in implementations.</t>
      <t>Deployment of SIG(0) transaction security <xref target="RFC2931"/> should consider the
       caveats with SIG(0) computational expense as it uses public key
       cryptography rather than the symmetric keys used by TSIG <xref target="RFC2845"/>. In
       addition, the identification of the appropriate keys needs
       similar mechanisms as those for deploying TSIG or,
       alternatively, the use of DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4033"/> signatures (RRSIGs) over the
       KEY RRs if published in DNS. This will in turn require the
       appropriate management of DNSSEC trust anchors.</t>
