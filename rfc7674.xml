        <xref target="RFC5575">"Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules"</xref>,
        commonly known as BGP Flowspec, provided for a 
        <xref target="RFC4360">BGP Extended Community</xref>
       that served to redirect traffic to a Virtual Routing and Forwarding
       (VRF) instance
            that matched the flow specification's Network Layer Reachability
	    Information (NLRI).  In RFC 5575, the
            Redirect Extended Community was documented as follows:

        <t>
            The IANA registry of BGP Extended Communities clearly identifies
        communities of specific formats.  For example, 
        <xref target="RFC4360">"Two-octet AS Specific Extended Community"</xref>,
        <xref target="RFC5668">"Four-octet AS Specific Extended Community"</xref>, and
        <xref target="RFC4360">"IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community"</xref>. 
        <xref target="RFC4360"> Route Targets</xref> identify this format
        in the high-order (Type) octet of the Extended Community and set
        the value of the low-order (Sub-Type) octet to 0x02.  The Value
        field of the Route Target Extended Community is intended to be
        interpreted in the context of its format.
        </t>
        <t>
            Since the Redirect Extended Community only registered a single
	    codepoint in IANA's BGP Extended Community registry, a common
	    interpretation of the Redirect Extended Community's "6-byte Route
	    Target" has been to look, at a receiving router, for a Route Target
	    value that matches the Route Target value in the received Redirect
	    Extended Community and import the advertised route to the
	    corresponding VRF instance subject to the rules defined in 
	    <xref target="RFC5575"/>.
	    However, because the Route Target format in the
	    Redirect Extended Community is not clearly defined, the wrong match
	    may occur.
        </t>
        <t>
	    This "value wildcard" matching behavior, which does not take into
	    account the format of the Route Target defined for a local VRF and
	    may result in the wrong matching decision, does not match deployed
	    implementations of BGP Flowspec. Deployed implementations of BGP
	    Flowspec solve this problem by defining different Redirect
	    Extended Communities that are specific to the format of the Route
	    Target value. This document defines the following Redirect Extended
	    Communities:

    <t>
        It should be noted that the low-order nibble of the Redirect's Type
        field corresponds to the Route Target Extended Community format field
    (Type).  (See Sections 3.1, 3.2, and 4 of <xref target="RFC4360"/> plus
    Section 2 of <xref target="RFC5668"/>.) The low-order octet (Sub-Type) of the
        Redirect Extended Community remains 0x08, in contrast to 0x02 for Route
        Targets.

    <t>
        The IANA registries for the BGP Extended Communities document
        <xref target="RFC7153"/> was written to update the
        previously mentioned IANA registries to better document BGP Extended
        Community formats.  The IANA Considerations section below further
        amends those registry updates in order to properly document the Flowspec
        redirect communities.
