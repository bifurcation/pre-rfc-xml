      <t>
	This document registers the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) mechanisms SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS,
	provides guidance for secure implementation of the original SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS mechanism,
	and updates the SCRAM registration procedures of RFC 5802.

      <t>
	This document registers the SASL mechanisms SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS.
	SHA-256 has stronger security properties than SHA-1, and it is expected that SCRAM mechanisms
	based on it will have greater predicted longevity than the SCRAM mechanisms based on SHA-1. 
      </t>
      <t>
	The registration form for the SCRAM family of algorithms is also updated from <xref target="RFC5802"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
	After publication of <xref target='RFC5802'/>, it was discovered that 
	Transport Layer Security (TLS) <xref target='RFC5246'/>
	does not have the expected properties for the "tls-unique" channel binding to be
	secure <xref target='RFC7627'/>.
	Therefore, this document contains normative
	text that applies to both the original SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS and the newly
	introduced SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS mechanism.
      </t>

	The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

    <section title='SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS'>
      <t>
	The SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS SASL mechanisms are defined in the same way
	that SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS are defined
	in <xref target='RFC5802'/>, except that the hash function for HMAC() and H() uses SHA-256 instead of SHA-1
	<xref target='RFC6234'/>.
      </t>
      <t>
	For the SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS SASL mechanisms, the
	hash iteration-count announced by a server SHOULD be at least 4096.
      </t>
      <t>
	The GSS-API mechanism OID for SCRAM-SHA-256 is 1.3.6.1.5.5.18 (see <xref target='iana'/>).
      </t>
      <t>
	This is a simple example of a SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication exchange
	when the client doesn't support channel bindings.
	The username 'user' and password 'pencil' are being used.

    <section title='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
      <t>
	The security considerations from <xref target='RFC5802'/> still apply.
      </t>



      <t>
	To be secure, either SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS and SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS MUST be used over a TLS channel that
	has had the session hash extension <xref target='RFC7627'/> negotiated, or session resumption MUST NOT
	have been used.
      </t>
      <t>
	See <xref target='RFC4270'/> and <xref target='RFC6194'/> for reasons to move from SHA-1 to
	a strong security mechanism like SHA-256.
      </t>
      <t>

	The strength of this mechanism is dependent in part on the hash iteration-count, as denoted by "i" in
	<xref target="RFC5802"/>.
	As a rule of thumb, the hash iteration-count should be such that a modern machine will take 0.1 seconds
	to perform the complete algorithm; however, this is unlikely to be practical on mobile devices and
	other relatively low-performance systems.
	At the time this was written, the rule of thumb gives around 15,000 iterations required;
	however, a hash iteration-count of 4096 takes around 0.5 seconds on current mobile handsets.
	This computational cost can be avoided by caching the ClientKey (assuming the Salt and hash iteration-count is stable).
	Therefore, the recommendation of this specification is that the hash iteration-count SHOULD be at least 4096, but careful
	consideration ought to be given to using a significantly higher value, particularly where mobile use is less important.

      <section title='SASL-SCRAM Family Mechanisms Registration Procedure'>
	<t>
	  A new IANA registry has been added for members of the SCRAM family of SASL mechanisms, named
	  "SASL SCRAM Family Mechanisms".
	  It adds two new fields to the existing SCRAM mechanism registry:
	  Minimum iteration-count and Associated OID.
	  Below is the template for registration of a new SASL family SCRAM.
	  (Note that the string "TBD-BY-IANA" should be left as is, so that it may be filled in
	  at registration time by IANA.)

	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Note: At publication of a new SASL SCRAM Family Mechanism,

	      this mechanism from the iso.org.dod.internet.security.mechanisms prefix
	      (see the "SMI Security for Mechanism Codes" registry) and fill in
	      the value for "TBD-BY-IANA" above.
	      Only one OID needs to be assigned for a SCRAM-&lt;NAME&gt; and SCRAM-&lt;NAME&gt;-PLUS pair.
	      The same OID should be assigned to both entries in the registry.

	    <t>
	      Note to future SASL SCRAM mechanism designers: each new SASL SCRAM

	  The existing entries for SASL SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS have been moved
	  from the existing SASL mechanism registry to the "SASL SCRAM Family Mechanisms" registry.
