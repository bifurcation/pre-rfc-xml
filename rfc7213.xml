    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) <xref target="RFC5921"></xref>
      is the set of protocol functions that meet the requirements <xref
      target="RFC5654"></xref> for the application of MPLS to the construction
      and operation of packet-switched transport networks. The MPLS-TP data
      plane consists of those MPLS-TP functions concerned with the
      encapsulation and forwarding of MPLS-TP packets and is described in
      <xref target="RFC5960"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document presents considerations for link-layer addressing of
      Ethernet frames carrying MPLS-TP packets. Since MPLS-TP packets are MPLS
      packets, existing procedures (<xref target="RFC3032"></xref>, <xref
      target="RFC5332"></xref>) for the encapsulation of MPLS packets over
      Ethernet apply. Because IP functionality is optional in an MPLS-TP
      network, IP-based protocols for Media Access Control (MAC) address
      learning, such as the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) <xref
      target="RFC826"></xref> and IPv6 Neighbor Discovery <xref
      target="RFC4861"></xref>, may not be available. This document specifies
      the options for the determination and selection of the next-hop Ethernet
      MAC address when MPLS-TP is used between nodes that do not have an IP
      data plane.</t>

    <section anchor="eth-p2p" title="Point-to-Point Link Addressing">
      <t>When two MPLS-TP nodes are connected by a point-to-point Ethernet
      link, the question arises as to what destination Ethernet Media Access
      Control (MAC) address should be specified in Ethernet frames transmitted
      to the peer node over the link. The problem of determining this address
      does not arise in IP/MPLS networks because of the presence of the
      Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol (commonly referred to as the Address
      Resolution Protocol and shortened to ARP) <xref target="RFC826"> </xref>
      or IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol <xref
      target="RFC4861"></xref>, which allow the unicast MAC address of the
      peer device to be learned dynamically.</t>

      <t>If existing mechanisms are available in an MPLS-TP network to
      determine the destination unicast MAC addresses of peer nodes, for
      example, if the network also happens to be an IP/MPLS network, or if the
      Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) <xref target="LLDP"></xref> is in
      use, these methods SHOULD be used. If ARP, ND, and LLDP are not
      available, and both peers implement the procedures in <xref
      target="gap"></xref> of this document, then the GAP mechanism described
      in this memo SHOULD be used. The remainder of this section discusses
      alternative options that might be employed when none of the preceding
      mechanisms for learning MAC addresses are available.</t>

      <t>One common approach is for each node to be statically configured with
      the MAC address of its peer. However, static MAC address configuration
      can present an administrative burden and lead to operational problems.
      For example, replacement of an Ethernet interface to resolve a hardware
      fault when this approach is used requires that the peer node be manually
      reconfigured with the new MAC address. This is especially problematic if
      the peer is operated by another provider.</t>

      <t>Another approach that may be considered is to use the Ethernet
      broadcast address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF as the destination MAC address 
      in frames carrying MPLS-TP packets over a link that is known to be
      point-to-point. This may, however, lead to excessive frame distribution
      and processing at the Ethernet layer. Broadcast traffic may also be
      treated specially by some devices, and this may not be desirable for
      MPLS-TP data frames.</t>

      <t>In view of the above considerations, this document recommends that,
      if a non-negotiated address is to be used, both nodes are configured to
      use as a destination MAC address an Ethernet multicast address reserved
      for MPLS-TP for use over point-to-point links. The address allocated for
      this purpose by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is
      01-00-5E-90-00-00. An MPLS-TP implementation MUST default to passing
to the MPLS sub-system any MPLS packets received from a point-to-point
Ethernet link with this destination MAC address.</t>

      <t>The use of broadcast or multicast addressing for the purpose
      described in this section, i.e., as a placeholder for the unknown unicast
      MAC address of the destination, is applicable only when the attached
      Ethernet link is known to be point-to-point. If a link is not known to
      be point-to-point, these forms of broadcast or multicast addressing MUST
      NOT be used. Thus, the implementation MUST provide a means for the
      operator to declare that a link is point-to-point if it supports these
      addressing modes. Moreover, the operator is cautioned that it is not
      always clear whether a given link is, or will remain, strictly
      point-to-point, particularly when the link is supplied by an external
      provider; point-to-point declarations therefore need to be used with
      care. Because of these caveats, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations
      support the procedures in <xref target="gap"></xref> so that unicast
      addressing can be used.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Multipoint Link Addressing">
      <t>When a multipoint Ethernet link serves as a section <xref
      target="RFC5960"></xref> for a point-to-multipoint MPLS-TP LSP, and
      multicast destination MAC addressing at the Ethernet layer is used for
      the LSP, the addressing and encapsulation procedures specified in <xref
      target="RFC5332"></xref> SHALL be used.</t>

      <t>When a multipoint Ethernet link (that is, a link that is not known to
      be point-to-point) serves as a section for a point-to-point MPLS-TP LSP,
      unicast destination MAC addresses MUST be used for Ethernet frames
      carrying packets of the LSP. According to the discussion in the previous
      section, this implies the use of either static MAC address configuration
      or a protocol that enables peer MAC address discovery.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="gap"
             title="MAC Address Discovery via the G-ACh Advertisement Protocol">
      <t>The G-ACh Advertisement Protocol (GAP) <xref
      target="RFC7212"></xref> provides a simple means of
      informing listeners on a link of the sender's capabilities and
      configuration. When used for this purpose on an Ethernet link, GAP
      messages are multicast to the address 01-00-5e-80-00-0d (see Section 7
of <xref
      target="RFC7212"></xref>). 

If these messages
      contain the unicast MAC address of the sender, then listeners can learn
      this address and use it in the future when transmitting frames
      containing MPLS-TP packets. Since the GAP does not rely on IP, this
      provides a means of unicast MAC discovery for MPLS-TP nodes without IP
      support.</t>

      <t>This document defines a new GAP application "Ethernet Interface
      Parameters" (0x0001) to support the advertisement of Ethernet-specific
      parameters associated with the sending interface. The following
      Type-Length-Value (TLV) objects are defined for this application; the
      TLV format is as defined in <xref
      target="RFC7212"></xref>:

<list style="empty">
          <t>Source MAC Address (type = 0, length = 8): The Value of this
          object is an EUI-64 <xref target="EUI-64"></xref> unicast MAC
          address assigned to one of the interfaces of the sender that is
          connected to this data link. The IEEE-defined mapping from 48-bit
          MAC addresses to EUI-64 form is used.</t>

          <t>Maximum Frame Size (MFS) (type = 1, length = 4): The Value of
          this object is a 32-bit unsigned integer encoded in network byte
          order that specifies the maximum frame size in octets of an Ethernet
          Frame that can be sent over the sending interface. Where MAC address
          learning occurs by some other means, this TLV group MAY be used to
          advertise only the MFS. If multiple advertisements are made for the
          same parameter, use of these advertisements is undefined.</t>

      <t></t>

      <t>Per <xref target="RFC7212"></xref>, MAC address
  discovery information needs to be
  periodically retransmitted and is to be retained by a receiver based
  on the period of time indicated by the associated Lifetime field.  To
  expedite the initialization of a link, it is RECOMMENDED that a node
  that has been reconfigured, rebooted, or is aware that it has been
  disconnected from its peer send a GAP Ethernet Interface Parameters
  message, and that it issue a GAP Request message for the Ethernet
  Interface Parameters of its peers, at the earliest opportunity.
      </t>

      <t>When the MAC address in the received Source MAC Address TLV changes,
      the new MAC address MUST be used (see Section 5.2 of <xref
      target="RFC7212"></xref>).</t>

      <t>If a minimum MFS is configured for a link and the MFS advertised by
      the peer is lower than that minimum, the operator MUST be notified of
      the MFS mismatch. Under these circumstances, the operator may choose to
      configure the LSR to shut down the link, thereby triggering a fault and
      causing the end-to-end path to be repaired. Alternatively, the
      operator may choose to configure the LSR to leave the link up so that an
      OAM message can be used to verify the actual MFS.</t>

      <t>A peer node could cease transmission of G-ACh advertisements, or
      cease to include a Source MAC Address TLV in advertisements, or cease to
      be connected, any of which will cause the TLV lifetime to expire. After
      the Source MAC Address TLV lifetime has expired, this MAC Address MUST
      NOT be used as the peer MAC address. The node MUST return to selecting
      MAC addresses as though no advertisements were received, using the
      method configured for this eventuality.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Manageability Considerations">
<t>
   The values sent and received by this protocol MUST be made accessible
   for inspection by network operators, and where local configuration is
   updated by received information, it MUST be clear why the configured
   value has been changed. If the received values change, the new values
   MUST be used and the change made visible to the network operators.
</t>
<t>
The Ethernet address and associated parameters
advertised for an interface SHOULD be persistent across restarts.
In the event of a system restart, any data that has been retained as
a consequence of prior Ethernet Interface Parameters advertisements
from GAP peers MUST be discarded; this prevents incorrect operation
on the basis of stale data.
    </t>

      <t>Where the link changes to a new type, i.e., from point-to-point to
      point-to-multipoint, the network operator SHOULD be informed. If the new
      link type is incompatible with the Ethernet addressing method in use, the
      system MUST take the action that is configured under those
      circumstances.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The use of broadcast or multicast Ethernet destination MAC addresses
      for frames carrying MPLS-TP data packets can potentially result in such
      frames being distributed to devices other than the intended destination
      node or nodes when the Ethernet link is not point-to-point. The operator
      should take care to ensure that MPLS-TP nodes are aware of the Ethernet
      link type (point-to-point or multipoint). In the case of multipoint
      links, the operator should either ensure that no devices are attached to
      the link that are not authorized to receive the frames or take steps to
      mitigate the possibility of excessive frame distribution (for example, by
      configuring the Ethernet switch to appropriately restrict the delivery
      of multicast frames to authorized ports).</t>

      <t>An attacker could disrupt communications by modifying the Source MAC
      Address or the MFS values; however, this is mitigated by the use of
      cryptographic authentication as described in <xref
      target="RFC7212"></xref>, which also describes other
      considerations applicable to the GAP protocol. Visibility into the
      contents of either of the TLVs could provide information that is useful
      for an attacker. This is best addressed by physical security of the
      links.</t>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <section title="Ethernet Multicast Address Allocation">
        <t>IANA has allocated an Ethernet multicast address from the "IANA
        Multicast 48-bit MAC Addresses" address block in the "Ethernet
        Numbers" registry for use by MPLS-TP LSRs over point-to-point links as
        described in <xref target="eth-p2p"></xref>. The allocated address is
        01-00-5E-90-00-00. IANA has updated the reference to point

<abstract>
<t>The implementation of protocol P on a sending host S decides, through protocol P's routing mechanism, that it wants to transmit to a target host T located some place on a connected piece of 10Mbit Ethernet cable.  To actually transmit the Ethernet packet a 48.bit Ethernet address must be generated.  The addresses of hosts within protocol P are not always compatible with the corresponding Ethernet address (being different lengths or values).  Presented here is a protocol that allows dynamic distribution of the information needed to build tables to translate an address A in protocol P's address space into a 48.bit Ethernet address.</t>
<t>Generalizations have been made which allow the protocol to be used for non-10Mbit Ethernet hardware.  Some packet radio networks are examples of such hardware.</t>
<t>The protocol proposed here is the result of a great deal of discussion with several other people, most notably J. Noel Chiappa, Yogen Dalal, and James E. Kulp, and helpful comments from David Moon.</t>
<t>The purpose of this RFC is to present a method of Converting Protocol Addresses (e.g., IP addresses) to Local Network Addresses (e.g., Ethernet addresses).  This is a issue of general concern in the ARPA Internet community at this time.  The method proposed here is presented for your consideration and comment.  This is not the specification of a Internet Standard.</t></abstract></front>
