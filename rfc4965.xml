    <abstract>
    <t>
    This document describes the collaboration and liaison relationship between the Internet Engineering 
    Task Force (IETF) and the Cable Television Laboratories, Inc. (CableLabs).
    </t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
	    <t>
   This document contains a set of principles and guidelines that serves
   as the basis for establishing a liaison relationship between the
   Cable Television Laboratories, Inc. and the Internet Engineering Task
   Force (IETF).  This cooperation framework is intended to secure timely
   development of technical specifications that facilitate maximum
   interoperability with existing Internet systems, devices, and
   protocols.
   </t>
   <t>
   CableLabs is a non-profit research and development consortium that is
   dedicated to pursuing new cable telecommunications technologies and
   to helping its cable operator members integrate those technical
   advancements into their business objectives. Within CableLabs,
   specification activities are organized into projects such as 
   DOCSIS(r), PacketCable(tm), and OpenCable(tm), and technical work is conducted in
   focus teams. Product vendors, manufacturers, and cable operator
   members are invited to join the focus teams that create technical
   specifications. From time to time, individuals involved with CableLabs focus teams submit CableLabs technical requirements or
requirement specifications to IETF in order to seek expert reviews and
solicit comments to create solutions that foster product
interoperability beyond cable. The submissions related to CableLabs specifications may, for example,
include use cases, protocol requirements, draft MIB modules, and
proposed solutions such as new DHCP options. CableLabs also references the work of IETF and 
   Request For Comments in its specifications. The list of CableLabs
   projects and specifications available publicly can be found at the
   CableLabs Web site, <eref
	   target="http://www.cablelabs.com">http://www.cablelabs.com</eref>.
   </t>
   <t>
   Within the IETF, activities are undertaken within a framework of
   Areas, with specific activities being undertaken by working groups
   that are chartered within each Area.  Working group output is
   reviewed by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) and
   published by the RFC Editor.  IETF activities are based on a
   principle of open contribution and participation by any interested
   party.  Details on the Internet Standards Process followed by the IETF can be found in <xref target="RFC2026"/>. Information on IETF working groups, current work item drafts,
   meeting schedules, and mailing lists are published on the IETF Web
   site, <eref target="http://www.ietf.org">http://www.ietf.org</eref>.
   </t>
   <t>
   The IETF and CableLabs are forming a liaison relationship with a mutual desire to
   support the integrity of specifications developed by each body.
   CableLabs does not develop standards other than through its
   participation with Standards Defining Organizations (SDOs) like the
   IETF.
   </t>
   <t>
   The preferred approach is that CableLabs uses the IETF
   specifications unchanged, if feasible, and communicates requirements for
   change to the IETF, as needed.  The parties intend to work together
   in an effort to avoid duplication of work.
   </t>
   <t>
   Within the framework of this liaison relationship, each organization will 
   operate according to its own rules and
   procedures, including rules governing Intellectual Property Rights
   (IPR), specification elaboration, approval, and maintenance.
   </t>
</section>
    <section title="Basis of Collaboration">
	    <t>
   In the further development of CableLabs specifications, the benefit
   of adopting IETF specifications has been identified. Although
   this document recognizes the importance of interoperability of the
   CableLabs specifications with the existing Internet and hence the use
   of IETF standards, CableLabs recognizes that additions or
   modifications might be needed in order to make the IETF 
   specifications meet the needs of CableLabs. In such cases, a CableLabs 
   individual or a vendor participant working on
   a CableLabs specification may take its concerns directly to the
   appropriate IETF working groups for resolution.  When no appropriate
   working group can be found or it is not known where to direct the
   communication, or in the case of resolution of consequent matters,
   the issue will be raised through the CableLabs designated liaison manager to
   the IETF liaison manager.
   </t>
   <t>
   The IETF may also need to ask questions of CableLabs in order to
   refine its understanding of CableLabs requirements or may wish to
   offer guidance to CableLabs on the effective use of IETF
   specifications.  Where possible, these communications will occur in
   the context of a discussion between CableLabs and an IETF working
   group.  In the event that a working-group-level discussion is deemed
   inappropriate for the desired communication, the matter will be
   raised through the IETF's designated liaison manager to CableLabs.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Document Sharing">
   <t>
   Both CableLabs and the IETF encourage the sharing of specification
   documents and draft requirements that are of mutual interest.
   </t>
   <t>
   All IETF documents are publicly available from the IETF Web site, and
   discussion of documents is hosted on open mailing lists.
   </t>
   <t>
   CableLabs documents intended for public consumption include CableLabs
   Technical Reports and CableLabs Specifications that are in an approved and published status. These documents have the CableLabs ISSUED
   status and are published for open access on CableLabs' Web site,
   <eref
	   target="http://www.cablelabs.com">http://www.cablelabs.com</eref>,
   or 
   <eref
	   target="http://www.cablelabs.com/specifications/archives/">http://www.cablelabs.com/specifications/archives/</eref>.

   </t>
   <t>
   In order for the IETF to make any reference (informative or normative), the document must be in an approved and published state,
and publicly available. It is expected that CableLabs will share relevant information with IETF participants via individual IETF Contributions, as 
   described in <xref target="RFC3978"/>, and without requiring a non-disclosure agreement.
   </t>
   <t>
   CableLabs and the IETF will work to update and exchange, when
   appropriate and on a regular basis, a list of dependencies between
   each organization's specifications and work in progress. 
   </t>
</section>


<section title="Participation in the IETF Process">
	<t>
		The Internet Standards Process is described in <xref
			target="RFC2026"/>.
Participation in the IETF process is open to any individual willing  
to contribute. This naturally includes individuals who also represent  
or otherwise contribute to the development of CableLabs  
specifications. Such individuals may freely participate in IETF  
mailing list discussions, submit and review Internet Drafts, and  
attend IETF meetings in order to assist the IETF in refining its  
understanding of CableLabs requirements as well as offering CableLabs  
an opportunity to receive informal guidance on CableLabs' use of IETF  
specifications.

The vast majority of technical discussions and decision making within  
the IETF is undertaken on open mailing lists.  Interested individuals  
should subscribe to and participate on these lists.
   </t>
   </section>
<section title="Designated Liaison Managers and Responsibilities">
	<t>

   When the informal working group level of interaction is insufficient,
   matters can be raised through a liaison channel.  CableLabs and the
   IETF shall each establish liaison functions for communication with
   the other organization and each shall appoint one individual acting as a liaison manager as described in <xref target="RFC4052"/> and <xref target="RFC4053"/>.
   </t>
   <t>
Formal communications from CableLabs will be initiated by the designated CableLabs liaison manager by sending a liaison statement to the IETF liaison manager; these must follow the procedures described in <xref target="RFC4053"/>. The role of the IETF liaison manager is defined in <xref target="RFC4052"/> and <xref target="RFC4691"/>. 

The IETF liaison manager is not responsible for notifying CableLabs  
of new work to be undertaken by the IETF.  Instead, the designated  
CableLabs liaison manager or delegates should subscribe to IETF lists  
announcing the creation or  rechartering of IETF working groups
(ietf-announce) and the lists announcing new work (new-work).
   </t>
    <section title="IETF Liaison Manager to CableLabs" toc="exclude">
   <t>
   The preferred way for organizations to work with IETF is through the
   working groups.  However, IETF has a limited number of 
   liaison relationships and liaison managers with other organizations when conditions warrant the
   appointment of a specific person.
   </t>
   <t>
   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) shall appoint a specific person
   to serve as the IETF liaison manager to CableLabs.  The role and responsibilities of the IETF liaison manager to CableLabs  
   are described below. In particular, it is expected that the designated liaison manager will act as an initial contact point in IETF for
   administrative aspects of this collaboration that cannot easily be
   handled in other ways (e.g., at a technical level by interactions
   with IETF Working Groups or Area Directors).  It is agreed that the
   role does not carry the expectation of attendance at CableLabs
   meetings or participation in CableLabs specification development
   processes, and it is anticipated that all liaison efforts assigned to
   this individual will be carried out by electronic mail.  It is
   understood that the IETF liaison manager does not have the ability to make
   exceptions to, or special provisions for, IETF policies and
   procedures.
   </t>
   <t>
   It is expected that the individual appointed to the liaison manager role would:
   <list style='symbols'>
	   <t>
	   perform all tasks as defined in <xref target="RFC4052"/> and <xref target="RFC4691"/>,
	   </t>
	   <t>
		   be informed by CableLabs, when appropriate, of
		   CableLabs activities within the IETF, including new
		   work proposals, and be able to report those using
		   appropriate channels within the IETF,
	   </t>
	   <t>
		   convey liaison statements from the IETF to CableLabs as described in <xref target="RFC4053"/>,
		   and be responsible for shepherding CableLabs
		   communication to the relevant parts of the IETF,
	   </t>
	    <t>
		   be able to raise issues with CableLabs technical
		   leadership as well as the IAB members and IETF 
		   Area Directors, as required.
	   </t>
   </list>

   CableLabs meetings are normally only open to delegates from CableLabs
   members or those manufacturers who have signed the appropriate
   agreements to participate in CableLabs projects or meetings. 
   </t>
   </section>
   
   <section title="CableLabs Liaison Manager to IETF" toc="exclude">
   <t>
   CableLabs shall establish an IETF liaison function and name an individual to be the CableLabs
   liaison Manager to IETF for matters pertaining to the CableLabs-IETF cooperation.  The CableLabs liaison manager to IETF is
   expected to work with the concerned IETF and CableLabs projects and
   focus teams and to support the interaction between CableLabs and the
   IETF.
   </t>
</section>

</section>


<section title="Formal Liaison Statements">
	<t>
   Whenever possible, and as the preferred primary method of
   communication and coordination of activity, communication at the
   working group level is strongly encouraged.
   </t>
   <t>
   When deemed necessary, formal communication between CableLabs and
   IETF is also permitted.  These communications are to be recorded in
   the form of Liaison Statements, and the IETF will use the CableLabs
   liaison manager to convey these statements between the IETF and
   CableLabs.  The procedure for proper handling of incoming
   liaison statements defined in  <xref target="RFC4053"/> must be followed by both the liaison manager named by IETF and the liaison manager designated by CableLabs. 
   
   It is important to note that all liaison statements made by the IETF or directed to
   the IETF shall be published by the IETF as public documents.  All
   liaison statements made by the IETF will comply with the IETF IPR
   policy as documented in <xref target="RFC3978"/>, 
  <xref target="RFC3979"/>, <xref target="RFC4748"/>, <xref target="RFC4371"/> and any updates.
  <!-- [rfced] Do you want to cite RFC 4748 here? -->
  <!-- jfm: yes added it in there and given this paragraph is about IPR policy, I have also added a citation to RFC 4371 -->

   </t>
</section>

<section title="Contributions">
   <t>
  Individuals who are involved in CableLabs' projects and are willing to contribute to IETF may make
   contributions to the IETF in their capacity as IETF participants,
   under the IETF's IPR policy, as documented in <xref target="RFC3978"/> and
   <xref target="RFC3979"/>.
   </t>
   <t>
   IETF participants whose companies are CableLabs members or have
   signed the appropriate agreements with CableLabs may also make
   contributions to CableLabs' projects and specifications.
   </t>
   <t>
   CableLabs mailing lists are not open to the general public.  It is
   recommended that work of mutual interest be discussed on the relevant
   IETF mailing lists.
   </t>
   <t>The IETF and CableLabs will not co-develop any documents or material.
   </t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">
	<t>
   This document does not directly affect the security of the Internet.
   </t>
</section>
   
<section title="IANA Considerations">
   <t>
       This section provides some guidelines for IANA to consider when
       adding references to a CableLabs specification in its
       registries.
   </t>
   <t>
       CableLabs maintains a specification repository with a stable
       URL for each published document under
       http://www.cablelabs.com/specifications/.  A stable document
       URL is one following the format:
       http://www.cablelabs.com/specifications/CableLabs_docname.pdf,
       where 'CableLabs_docname' is the CableLabs document name.
   </t>
   <t>
      IANA is requested to use the above document URL format when
      referencing CableLabs specifications in its registries.
