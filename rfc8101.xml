<section title="Introduction">

<t>
The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has defined a Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) over LTE service <xref target="TS.3GPP.22.179"/>. The MCPTT service supports an enhanced Push To Talk (PTT) service that is suitable for mission
critical scenarios and is based upon 3GPP Evolved Packet System (EPS)
services. The requirements for the MCPTT service defined within 3GPP can also form the basis for other PTT services. 


</t>

<t>The MCPTT service is intended to support communication between
several users (a group call), where each user can gain permission to
talk in an arbitrated manner. However, the MCPTT service also supports
private calls between pairs of users. </t>

<t>MCPTT is primarily targeted to provide a professional PTT service
to, e.g., public safety, transport companies, utilities, and
industrial and nuclear plants. In addition to this, a commercial PTT
service for non-professional use (e.g., groups of people on holiday)
may be delivered through an MCPTT system. Based on their operational
model, the performance and MCPTT features in use vary per user
organization, where functionality that is more
mission-critical-specific (e.g., Imminent Peril Call) might not be
available to commercial customers. </t>

<t>The MCPTT service provides its users with different priorities for
the access to network resources in order to provide means to
prioritize between calls when resources are scarce. Among other things, these priorities
take into account the priority and role of the
caller, the priority and type of the group, and the situation in which
the call is made. </t>


<t>
The SIP-level call control procedures using these namespaces are
specified in <xref target="TS.3GPP.24.379"/>. The namespaces defined
here will support a wide range of queuing options. The namespaces
correspond to what can be supported over the 3GPP Rx interface,
defined in <xref target="TS.3GPP.29.214"/>. The usage of the
namespaces can be tailored to the needs of the operator. The mechanism
to do this is to configure which values a specific user is allowed to
use. This configuration is specified in <xref
target="TS.3GPP.24.384"/>.
</t>

<t>High-priority calls (when the life of either a public safety worker or anyone else is in danger) need to be set up immediately; thus, they require preemption. Other calls may be less sensitive in call
setup time but have a high priority once established. For these calls,
a queueing mechanism is more appropriate. The MCPTT data transfer
service currently under development can benefit from a queueing
mechanism. Another example is video-only calls that are not critical
in call setup time but where keeping the call is important. </t>

<t>This document creates additional SIP
Resource-Priority namespaces to meet the requirements of the 3GPP-defined MCPTT and places these namespaces in
the IANA registry. </t>



</section>

<section title="Applicability">

<t>This document defines namespaces applicable for MCPTT services
defined by 3GPP that use the network services of a 3GPP-defined LTE
network. The use of this namespace outside such networks is
undefined. </t>

</section>

<section title="New SIP Resource-Priority Namespaces Created">

<section title="Introduction">

<t>This document introduces the following MCPTT namespaces: mcpttp and mcpttq.
The names of which come from the 3GPP-defined MCPTT
service. </t>

</section>

<section title="The MCPTT Namespaces">

<t>
The mcpttp namespace uses the priority levels listed below from lowest to highest priority. 
<list style="empty">
<t>mcpttp.0 (lowest priority)</t>
<t>mcpttp.1</t>
<t>mcpttp.2</t>
<t>mcpttp.3</t>
<t>mcpttp.4</t>
<t>mcpttp.5</t>
<t>mcpttp.6</t>
<t>mcpttp.7</t>
<t>mcpttp.8</t>
<t>mcpttp.9</t>
<t>mcpttp.10</t>
<t>mcpttp.11</t>
<t>mcpttp.12</t>
<t>mcpttp.13</t>
<t>mcpttp.14</t>
<t>mcpttp.15 (highest priority)</t>

</list>

</t>
<t>The Namespace Numerical Value is 46.</t>

<t>Intended algorithm for mcpttp is preemption. </t>

<t>New Warning code: No. </t>

<t>New SIP response code: No. </t>


<t>
The mcpttq namespace uses the priority levels listed below from lowest to highest priority. 

<list style="empty">

<t>mcpttq.0 (lowest priority)</t>
<t>mcpttq.1</t>
<t>mcpttq.2</t>
<t>mcpttq.3</t>
<t>mcpttq.4</t>
<t>mcpttq.5</t>
<t>mcpttq.6</t>
<t>mcpttq.7</t>
<t>mcpttq.8</t>
<t>mcpttq.9</t>
<t>mcpttq.10</t>
<t>mcpttq.11</t>
<t>mcpttq.12</t>
<t>mcpttq.13</t>
<t>mcpttq.14</t>
<t>mcpttq.15 (highest priority)</t>

</list>

</t>
<t>The Namespace Numerical Value is 47.</t>
<t> Intended algorithm for mcpttq is queuing. </t>
<t> New Warning code: No. </t>
<t> New SIP response code: No. </t>

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t> This document does not have any impact on the security of the SIP
MCPTT protocol. Its purpose is purely administrative in nature. </t>

</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="section.iana">

<t>Abiding by the rules established within 
<xref target="RFC4412"/> and <xref target="RFC7134"/>, this is an Informational RFC creating two new namespaces, their
associated priority-values, and intended algorithms.
