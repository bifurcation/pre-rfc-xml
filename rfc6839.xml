    <abstract>
      <t>
	A content media type name sometimes includes partitioned
	meta-information distinguished by a structured syntax to permit noting an
	attribute of the media as a suffix to the name.
	This document defines several structured syntax suffixes for use with
media type registrations. 
	In particular, it defines and registers the "+json", "+ber", "+der",
"+fastinfoset", "+wbxml" 
	and "+zip" structured syntax suffixes, and provides a 
media type structured syntax suffix registration form for the 
	"+xml" structured syntax suffix.

    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>
	<xref target='RFC3023'/> created the +xml suffix convention that can be
used when 
	defining names for media types whose representation uses XML
underneath. That is, 
	they could have been successfully
	parsed as if the media type had been application/xml in addition to
their being parsed 
	as their media type that is using the +xml suffix.
	<xref target='RFC6838'/> defines the media type "Structured Syntax
	Suffix Registry" to be used for such structured syntax suffixes.
      </t>

      <t>
	A variety of structured syntax suffixes have already been used in some media type registrations,
	in particular "+json", "+der", "+fastinfoset", and "+wbxml".
	This document defines and registers these structured syntax suffixes in the
	Structured Syntax Suffix Registry, along with "+ber" and "+zip".
	In addition, this document updates <xref target='RFC3023'/> to formally register the "+xml"
	structured syntax suffix according to the procedure defined in <xref target='RFC6838'/>.

    <section title='When to Use These Structured Syntax Suffixes'>
      <t>
	Each of the structured syntax suffixes defined in this document is appropriate for
	use when the media type identifies the semantics of the protocol payload. That is,
	knowing the semantics of the specific media type provides for more specific processing
	of the content than that afforded by generic processing of the underlying representation.
      </t>
      <t>
	At the same time, using the suffix allows receivers of the media types to do generic
	processing of the underlying representation in cases where
	<list hangIndent='0'>
	  <t>they do not need to perform special handling of the particular semantics of the
	    exact media type, and
	  </t>
	  <t>there is no special knowledge needed by such a generic processor in order to
	    parse that underlying representation other than what would be needed to parse
	    any example of that underlying representation.

      <t>
	When updating a +&lt;suffix&gt; registration, care should be taken to review all
	previously-registered xxx/yyy+&lt;suffix&gt; media types as to whether they
	might be affected by the updated +&lt;suffix&gt; registration.
	Because the generic fragment identifier processing rules take precedence over media-type-specific rules,
	introducing new or changing existing definitions may break the existing registrations of specific
	media types, as well as particular implementations of applications that process affected media types.
	Such changes can introduce interoperability and security issues.
      </t>

      <t>
	When updating the fragment identifier processing rules for a specific xxx/yyy+&lt;suffix&gt; media type,
	care should be taken
	to review the generic fragment identifier processing rules for the +&lt;suffix&gt; registration and
	not introduce any conflicts. Because the generic fragment identifier processing rules take precedence
	over media-type-specific rules, such conflicting processing requirements should be ignored by
	an implementation, but such conflicts can introduce interoperability and security issues.
      </t>

      <t>
	Note that <xref target='FRAGID-BP'/> provides additional advice to designers of fragment identifier rules
	for media type suffixes and specific media types.

<abstract><t>This specification standardizes three media types -- application/xml, application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd -- for use in exchanging network entities that are related to the Extensible Markup Language (XML) while defining text/xml and text/ xml-external-parsed-entity as aliases for the respective application/ types.  This specification also standardizes a convention (using the suffix '+xml') for naming media types outside of these five types when those media types represent XML MIME entities.  XML MIME entities are currently exchanged via the HyperText Transfer Protocol on the World Wide Web, are an integral part of the WebDAV protocol for remote web authoring, and are expected to have utility in many domains.  Major differences from [RFC3023] are alignment of charset handling for text/xml and text/xml-external-parsed-entity with application/ xml, the addition of XPointer and XML Base as fragment identifiers and base URIs, respectively, mention of the XPointer Registry, and updating of many references.</t></abstract>
