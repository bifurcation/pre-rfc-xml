<abstract>

<t>Recent statements from the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the
Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) Security and Stability
Advisory Committee have focused on the problems that the DNS is likely to experience
with top-level domains (TLDs) that contain address records 
(so-called "dotless domains").
In order to help researchers determine the extent of the issues with dotless
domains, this document lists the current dotless TLDs and gives a
script for finding them.
This document
lists data about dotless TLDs but does not address the policy and technology issues
other than to point to the statements of others.</t>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>In the past few years, well-respected groups have issued documents about top-level domains in the
DNS that contain address records (so&nbhy;called "dotless domains").  The Security and Stability
Advisory Committee (SSAC) of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) issued
a report called "Report on Dotless Domains" <xref
target="SAC053"/> in February 2012. The Internet
Architecture Board (IAB) issued a statement called "Dotless Domains Considered Harmful" <xref
target="IAB-DOTLESS"/> in July 2013.
The New gTLD Program Committee of the ICANN Board of Directors (NGPC) approved a resolution
on dotless domains <xref target="NGPC-DOTLESS"/> in August 2013.
(The authors of this document note that they are not on
the SSAC, the IAB, or the ICANN Board.)
</t>

<t>All of these documents consider the effects of dotless domains without describing the extent
of their current deployment.
In order to help researchers determine the extent of the problems with dotless domains, this document lists the known dotless domains at the time of
publication and shows how researchers can find them in the future.
In this document, we consider any TLD with an A, AAAA, and/or MX record at the apex to be dotless.
This document is meant to provide
current data to the Internet community but does not give advice.</t>

<t>Many people have expressed a belief that ICANN prohibits all TLDs
from being dotless. That belief is not true; ICANN's policies apply only to their
contracted TLDs. This document shows the extent to which dotless domains exist today.</t>

</section>

<section title="Current Dotless Domains">

<t>
This section shows the dotless domains we found on September 3, 2013,
using the script in <xref target="Script"/>.  The data was nearly constant for many
months, with very few additions or deletions of records.
</t>

<t>
We checked every TLD in the root zone to see which ones had A, AAAA,
or MX records.  We found that about 5% of the TLDs did, and all of the
TLDs that do are two-letter TLDs or country code TLDs (which are also known as ccTLDs).
</t>

<section title="TLDs with A Records">

<t>At the time this document is published, the following TLDs have A records.</t>

AC has address 193.223.78.210
AI has address 209.59.119.34

<section title="TLDs with AAAA Records">

<t>At the time this document is published, the following TLD has an AAAA record.</t>

DK has IPv6 address 2a01:630:0:40:b1a:b1a:2011:1

</section>

<section title="TLDs with MX Records">

<t>At the time this document is published, the following TLDs have MX records. The SSAC report
implies, but does not explicitly say,
that MX records would cause a TLD to be considered dotless; the IAB
report does not mention MX records at all.</t>

<t>This document lists the known dotless domains; it does not express an opinion
whether or not there are security considerations with the existence of dotless
domains. The referenced IAB and SSAC reports discuss the opinions of the respective
bodies on the security and stability considerations of dotless domains.</t>

<section anchor="Script" title="Script for Finding Dotless Domains">

<t>The following Bourne shell script was used for finding the data in this document. The authors
believe that this script will work correctly on a wide variety of operating
systems and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. As is customary
in the current legal environment,
the authors make no assurance that the script is correct or that the script will
not cause damage on a system where it is run.</t>

<t>The script checks each nameserver for each TLD instead of just doing a simple query because the
nameservers for some of the TLDs have inconsistent data in them with respect to the records shown
here.</t>
