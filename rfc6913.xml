    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines and registers with IANA the new "fax" media
   feature tag for use with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
   Currently, fax calls are indistinguishable from voice calls at call initiation. Consequently, fax calls can be routed to SIP user agents that are not fax capable. A "fax" media feature tag implemented in conjunction with caller preferences allows for more accurate fax call routing.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
		<t>Fax communications in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261"/> are handled in a "voice first" manner. Indications that a user desires to use a fax transport protocol, such as ITU-T T.38 <xref target="T38"></xref>, to send a fax are not known when the initial INVITE message is sent. The call is set up as a voice call first, and then, only after it is connected, does a switchover to the T.38 <xref target="T38"></xref> protocol occur. This is problematic in that fax calls can be routed inadvertently to SIP user agents (UAs) that are not fax capable.</t>
	
		<t>To ensure that fax calls are routed to fax-capable SIP UAs,
an implementation of caller preferences defined in RFC 3841 <xref
target="RFC3841"/> can be used. Feature preferences are a part of RFC 3841 <xref target="RFC3841"/> that would allow UAs to express their preference for receiving fax communications. Subsequently, SIP servers take these preferences into account to increase the likelihood that fax calls are routed to fax-capable SIP UAs.
</t>
	
		<t>This document defines the "fax" media feature tag for use in
the SIP tree, as per Section 12.1 of RFC 3840 <xref target="RFC3840"/>.  This
feature tag will be applied per RFC 3841 <xref target="RFC3841"/> as a feature preference for fax-capable UAs.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Terminology" title="Terminology">
		<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
"SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
	</section>
	
	<section anchor="Motivation" title="Motivation">
		<t>In the majority of circumstances, it is preferred that capabilities be handled in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) portion of the SIP <xref target="RFC3261"/> communication. However, fax is somewhat unique in that the ultimate intention of the call is not accurately signaled in the initial SDP exchange. Specifically, indications of T.38 <xref target="T38"></xref> or any other fax transport protocol in the call are not known when the call is initiated by an INVITE message. Fax calls are always considered voice calls until after they are connected. This results in the possibility of fax calls being received by SIP UAs that are not capable of handling fax transmissions.</t>
		
		<t>For example, Alice wants to send a fax to Bob. Bob has registered two SIP UAs. The first SIP UA is not fax capable, but the second one supports the T.38 <xref target="T38"></xref> fax protocol. Currently, SIP servers are unable to know at the time that the call starts that Alice prefers a fax-capable SIP UA to handle her call. Additionally, the SIP servers are also not aware of which of Bob's SIP UAs are fax capable.</t>
		
		<t>To resolve this issue of calls not arriving at a UA that
supports fax, this document defines a new media feature tag specific to fax,
per RFC 3840 <xref target="RFC3840"/>. Caller preferences, as defined in RFC 3841 <xref target="RFC3841"/>, can then be used for registering UAs that support fax and for routing fax calls to these UAs. Thus, Alice can express up front that she prefers a T.38 <xref target="T38"></xref> fax-capable SIP UA for this call. At the same time, Bob's SIP UAs have expressed their fax capabilities as well during registration. Now, when Alice places a fax call to Bob, the call is appropriately routed to Bob's fax-capable SIP UA.</t>

	</section>
	
<section anchor="Usage" title="Usage of the &quot;sip.fax&quot; Parameter">
	

<t>The "sip.fax" media feature tag is a new string parameter, defined in this
document, that allows a call to indicate a fax preference.  A receiving UA
includes the "sip.fax" media feature tag in the Contact header field of
REGISTER messages to indicate that it is fax capable, and a SIP Registrar
includes this tag in the Contact header field of its 200 OK response to confirm
the registration of this preference, all as per RFC 3840 <xref target="RFC3840"/>.</t>

<t>A calling UA SHOULD include the "sip.fax" media feature tag in the
Accept-Contact header of an INVITE request in order to express its desire for a call to
be routed to a fax-capable UA.  Otherwise, without this tag, fax call
determination is not possible until after the call is connected.  If a calling
UA includes the "sip.fax" tag and the SIP network elements that process the
call (including the called UAs) implement the procedures of RFC 3840 and RFC 3841, the call will be preferentially routed to UAs that have advertised their support for this feature (by including it in the Contact header of their REGISTER requests, as documented above).</t>

<t>It is possible for the calling UA to utilize additional procedures defined
in RFC 3840 and RFC 3841 to express a requirement (instead of a preference) that its
call be delivered to fax-capable UAs.  However, the calling UA SHOULD NOT
require the "sip.fax" media type. Doing so could result in call failure for a
number of reasons, not only because there may not be any receiving UAs
registered that have advertised their support for this feature, but also
because one or more SIP network elements that process the call may not support
the processing defined in RFC 3840 and RFC 3841. A calling UA that wishes to express this requirement should be prepared to relax it to a preference if it receives a failure response indicating that the requirement mechanism itself is not supported by the called UAs, their proxies, or other SIP network elements.</t>

<t>When calls do connect through the use of "sip.fax" either as a preference
or a requirement, UAs should follow standard fax negotiation
procedures documented in ITU-T T.38 <xref target="T38"></xref> for T.38 fax calls and ITU-T G.711 <xref target="G711"></xref> and ITU-T V.152 <xref target="V152"></xref>, Sections 6 and 6.1, for fax passthrough calls.  Subsequently, the "sip.fax" feature tag has two allowed values: "t38" and "passthrough".  The "t38" value indicates that the impending call will utilize the ITU-T T.38 <xref target="T38"></xref> protocol for the fax transmission.  The "passthrough" value indicates that the ITU-T G.711 <xref target="G711"></xref> codec will be used to transport the fax call.</t>
