<t>The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and GSM Association (GSMA) held a
joint workshop on Managing Radio Networks in an Encrypted World (MaRNEW), on
September 24-25, 2015. This workshop aimed to discuss solutions for bandwidth
optimization on mobile networks for encrypted content, as current solutions
rely on unencrypted content, which is not indicative of the security needs of
today's Internet users. The workshop gathered IETF attendees, IAB members, and
participants from various organizations involved in the telecommunications
industry including original equipment manufacturers, content providers, and
mobile network operators.</t> 

<t>The group discussed Internet encryption trends and deployment issues
identified within the IETF and the privacy needs of users that should be
adhered to.  Solutions designed around sharing data from the network to the
endpoints and vice versa were then discussed; in addition, issues
experienced when using current transport-layer protocols were also discussed.
Content providers and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) gave their own views of
their experiences delivering their content with mobile network operators.
Finally, technical responses to regulation were discussed to help the
regulated industries relay the issues of impossible-to-implement or
bad-for-privacy technologies back to regulators.</t>

<t>A group of suggested solutions were devised, which will be discussed in
various IETF groups moving forward.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and GSM Association (GSMA) held a
joint workshop on Managing Radio Networks in an Encrypted World (MaRNEW), on
September 24-25, 2015. This workshop aimed to discuss solutions for bandwidth
optimization on mobile networks for encrypted content, as current solutions
rely on unencrypted content, which is not indicative of the security needs of
today's Internet users.</t> 

<t>Mobile networks have a set of properties that place a large emphasis on
sophisticated bandwidth optimization.  The use of encryption is increasing on
the Internet, which is positive for consumer and business privacy and
security.  Many existing solutions for mobile bandwidth optimization primarily
operate on non-encrypted communications; this can lead to performance issues
being amplified on mobile networks.  The use of encryption on networks will
continue to increase; with this understanding, the workshop aimed to
understand how we can solve the issues of bandwidth optimization and
performance on radio networks in this encrypted world.</t>

<section anchor="understanding-bandwidth-optimization" title='Understanding "Bandwidth Optimization"'>

<t>For the purposes of this workshop, bandwidth optimization encompasses a
variety of technical topics related to traffic engineering, prioritization,
optimization, and efficiency enhancements. It also encompasses user-related
topics such as specific subscription or billing models, and it may touch upon regulatory aspects or other issues relating to government-initiated regulatory concerns.</t>

<t>The first category of bandwidth optimization includes the following:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Caching</t>
  <t>Prioritization of interactive traffic over background traffic</t>
  <t>Per-user bandwidth limits</t>
</list></t>

<t>The second category of bandwidth optimization may depend on one or more of the first category optimization strategies, but may, in particular, also encompass business-related topics such as content delivery arrangements with content providers.</t>

<t>Finally, while not strictly speaking of traffic management, some networks employ policy-based filtering (e.g., requested parental controls), and many networks support some form of legal interception functionality per applicable laws.</t>

<t>Many of these functions can continue as they are performed today, even with
increased use of encryption.  Others are using methods that inspect parts of
the communication that are not encrypted today, but will be encrypted, and
these functions will have to be done differently in an increasingly encrypted Internet.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="topics" title="Topics">
<t>The workshop aimed to answer questions that focused on:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>understanding the bandwidth optimization use cases particular to radio networks;</t>
  <t>understanding existing approaches and how these do not work with encrypted traffic;</t>
  <t>understanding reasons why the Internet has not standardized support for lawful intercept and why mobile networks have;</t>
  <t>determining how to match traffic types with bandwidth optimization methods</t>
  <t>discussing minimal information to be shared to manage networks but ensure user security and privacy;</t>
  <t>developing new bandwidth optimization techniques and protocols within these new constraints;</t>
  <t>discussing the appropriate network layer(s) for each management function;
  and</t>
  <t>cooperative methods of bandwidth optimization and issues associated with these.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The further aim was to gather architectural and engineering guidance on
future work in the bandwidth optimization area based on the discussions around
the proposed approaches. The workshop also explored possible areas for
standardization, e.g., new protocols that can aid bandwidth optimization whilst
ensuring that user security is in line with new work in transport-layer
protocols.</t> 

</section>
<section anchor="organization-of-this-report" title="Organization of This Report">

<t>This workshop report summarizes the contributions to and discussions at the
workshop, organized by topic.  The workshop began with scene-setting topics
that covered the issues around deploying encryption, the increased need for
privacy on the Internet, and setting a clear understanding that ciphertext
should remain unbroken. Later sessions focused on key solution areas; these
included evolution on the transport layer and sending data up or down the
path. A session on application layers and CDNs aimed to highlight both issues
and solutions experienced on the application layer. The workshop ended 
with a session dedicated to discussing a technical response to regulation with
regards to encryption. The contributing documents identified the issues
experienced with encryption on radio networks and suggested solutions. Of 
the solutions suggested, some focused on transport
evolution, some on trusted middleboxes, and others on collaborative data
exchange. Solutions were discussed within the sessions. All accepted position
papers and detailed transcripts of discussion are available at <xref
target="MARNEW"/>.</t> 

<t>The outcomes of the workshop are discussed in Sections <xref
target="suggested-principles-and-solutions" format="counter"/> and <xref
target="since-marnew" format="counter"/>; they discuss the progress made since
the workshop toward each of the identified work items through the time this
document was approved for publication.</t>

<t>Report readers should be reminded that this workshop did not aim to discuss regulation or legislation, although policy topics were mentioned in discussions from time to time.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="use-of-note-well-and-chatham-house-rule" 
	 title="Use of Note Well and the Chatham House Rule">

<t>The workshop was conducted under the IETF <xref target="NOTE_WELL"/> with
the exception of the "Technical Analysis and Response to Potential Regulatory
Reaction" session, which was conducted under the <xref target="CHATHAM_HOUSE_RULE"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="ietf-and-gsma" title="IETF and GSMA">

<t>The IETF and GSMA <xref target="GSMA"/> have different working practices, standards, and processes. IETF is an open organization with community-driven standards, with the key aim of functionality and security for the Internet's users, while the GSMA is membership based and serves the needs of its membership base, most of whom are mobile network operators.</t>

<t>Unlike IETF, GSMA makes few standards. Within the telecommunications industry, standards are set in various divergent groups depending on their purpose. Perhaps of most relevance to the bandwidth optimization topic here is the work of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) <xref target="SDO_3GPP"/>, which works on radio network and core network standards. &nbsp;3GPP members include mobile operators and original equipment manufacturers.</t>

<t>One of the 3GPP standards relevant to this workshop is Policy and Charging
Control QoS <xref target="PCC-QOS"/>. Traditionally, mobile networks have managed different applications and services based on the resources available and priorities given; for instance, emergency services have a top priority, data has a lower priority, and voice services are somewhere in-between. &nbsp;3GPP defined the PCC-QoS mechanism to support this functionality, and this depends on unencrypted communications <xref target="EffectEncrypt"/>.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="scene-setting-sessions" title="Scene-Setting Sessions">

<t>Scene-setting sessions aimed to bring all attendees up to a basic
understanding of the problem and the scope of the workshop.</t>

<t>There were three scene-setting sessions:
<list style="symbols">
<t><xref target="scene-setting"/>: Scene Setting</t>
<t><xref target="encryption-deployment-considerations"/>: Encryption
Deployment Considerations</t>
<t><xref target="awareness-of-user-choice-privacy"/>: Awareness of User Choice
(Privacy)</t>
</list>
</t>


<section anchor="scene-setting" title="Scene Setting">

<t>The telecommunications industry and Internet standards community are
extremely different in terms of ethos and practices. Both groups drive
technical standards in their domain and build technical solutions with some
policy-driven use cases. These technologies, use cases, and technical
implementations are different, and the motivators between the two industries
are also diverse.</t>

<t>To ensure all attendees were aligned with contributing to discussions and
driving solutions, this "Scene Setting" session worked on generating a clear
scope with all attendees involved. In short, it was agreed that 1) ciphertext 
encrypted by one party and intended to be decrypted by a second party should
not be decrypted by a third party in any solution, 2) the Radio Access Network
(RAN) does experience issues with increased encrypted traffic, 3) the RAN
issues need to be understood precisely, and 4) the goal is to improve user 
experience on the Internet. Proposing new technical solutions
based on presumed future regulation was not in scope. The full scope is given
below.</t>

<section anchor="scope" title="Scope">
<t>The attendees identified and agreed to the scope described here.</t>
<t>We should
do the following:<list style="symbols"> 
  <t>in discussion, assume that there is no broken crypto;
  ciphertext is increasingly common; congestion does need to be
  controlled (as do other transport issues); and network management, including efficient use of resources in RAN and elsewhere, has to work;</t>
  <t>identify how/why RAN is different for transport, and attempt to
  understand the complexities of RAN (i.e., how hard it is to manage) and why
  those complexities matter;</t> 
  <t>identify the precise problems caused by increased use of encryption;</t>
  <t>identify players (in addition to end users), the resulting tensions, and
  how ciphertext changes those tensions;</t>
  <t>discuss how some solutions will be radically changed by ciphertext (it's ok to talk about that)</t>
  <t>assume that the best possible quality of experience for the end user
  is a goal; and lastly,</t> 
  <t>for the next two days, aim to analyze the situation and identify
  specific achievable tasks that could be tackled in the IETF or GSMA (or
  elsewhere) and that improve the Internet given the assumptions above.</t>
</list></t>
  <t>We should not delve into the following:</t>
<t><list style="symbols">
      <t>ways of doing interception, legal or not, for the reasons
      described in <xref target="RFC2804"/>; and,</t>
      <t>unpredictable political actions.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="encryption-statistics-and-radio-access-network-differences" title="Encryption Statistics and Radio Access Network Differences">

<t>According to then-current statistics, attendees were shown that
encrypted content reaches around 50% <xref target="STATE_BROWSER"/> <xref target="STATE_SERVER"/>. The IAB is
encouraging all IETF working groups to consider the effect encryption being
"on by default" will have on new protocol work. The IETF is also working on
encryption at lower layers. One recent example of this work is opportunistic
TCP encryption within the TCP Increased Security <xref target="TCPINC"/> Working Group. The aims of
these work items are greater security and privacy for end users and their
data.</t>

<t>Telecommunications networks often contain middleboxes that operators have previously considered to be trusted, but qualifying trust is difficult and should not be assumed. Some interesting use cases exist with these middleboxes, such as anti-spam and malware detection, but these need to be balanced against their ability to open up cracks in the network for attacks such as pervasive monitoring.</t>

<t>When operators increase the number of radio access network cells (base
stations), this can improve the radio access network quality of service;
however, it also adds to radio pollution. This is one example of the balancing 
act required when devising radio access network architecture.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="encryption-deployment-considerations" title="Encryption Deployment Considerations">

<t>Encryption across the Internet is on the rise. However, some organizations
and individuals that are mainly driven by commerical perspectives come across
a common set of operational issues when deploying encryption. <xref
target="RFC8404"/> explains these network management function
impacts, detailing areas around incident monitoring, access control
management, and regulation on mobile networks. The data was collected from
various Internet players, including system and network administrators across
enterprise, governmental organizations, and personal use. The aim of the
document is to gain an understanding of what is needed for technical solutions
to these issues while maintaining security and privacy for users. Attendees
commented that worthwhile additions would be different business environments
(e.g., cloud environments) and service chaining. Incident monitoring in
particular was noted as a difficult issue to solve given the use of URLs in
today's incident monitoring middleware.</t>

<t>Some of these impacts to mobile networks can be resolved using different
methods, and the <xref target="NETWORK_MANAGEMENT"/> document details these
methods. The document focuses heavily on methods to manage network traffic
without breaching user privacy and security.</t>

<t>By reviewing encryption deployment issues and the alternative methods
of network management, MaRNEW attendees were made aware of the issues
that affect radio networks, the deployment issues that are solvable
and require no further action, and those issues that have not yet been solved
but should be addressed within the workshop.</t> 

</section>
<section anchor="awareness-of-user-choice-privacy" title="Awareness of User Choice (Privacy)">

<t>Some solutions intended to improve delivery of encrypted content could affect some or all of the privacy benefits that encryption provides. Understanding user needs and desires for privacy is therefore important when designing these solutions.</t>

<t>
From a then-current study <xref target="Pew2014"/>, 64% of users said
concerns over privacy have increased, and 67% of mobile Internet users would
like to do more to protect their privacy. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
and IETF have both responded to user desires for better privacy by
recommending encryption for new protocols and web technologies. Within the
W3C, new security standards are emerging, and the design principles for HTML
maintain that users are the stakeholders with the highest priority, followed by
implementors and other stakeholders, which further enforces the "user first"
principle. Users also have certain security expectations from particular
contexts and sometimes use new technologies to further protect their privacy,
even if those technologies weren't initially developed for that purpose.</t>


<t>Operators may deploy technologies that can either impact user privacy 
without being aware of those privacy implications or incorrectly assume that 
the benefits users gain from the new technology outweigh the loss of privacy. 
If these technologies are necessary, they should be opt in.</t>

<t>Internet stakeholders should understand the priority of other stakeholders. Users should be considered the first priority. Other stakeholders include implementors, developers, advertisers, operators, and other ISPs. Some technologies, such as cookie use and JavaScript injection, have been abused by these parties. This has caused some developers to encrypt content to circumvent these technologies that are seen as intrusive or bad for user privacy.</t>

<t>If users and content providers are to opt in to network management services
with negative privacy impacts, they should see clear value from using these
services and understand the impacts of using these services. Users should also
have easy abilities to opt out. Some users will always automatically click
through consent requests, so any model relying on explicit consent is flawed
for these users. Understanding the extent of "auto click-through" may improve
decisions about the use of consent requests in the future. 
One model (Cooperative Traffic Management) works as an agent of the user; by
opting in, metadata can be shared. Issues with this involve trust only being applied at endpoints.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="network-or-transport-solution-sessions" title="Network or Transport Solution Sessions">

<t>Network or Transport Solution Sessions discussed proposed solutions
for managing encrypted traffic on radio access networks. Most solutions focus
on metadata sharing, whether this sharing takes place from the endpoint to the
network, from the network to the endpoint, or cooperatively in both
directions. Transport-layer protocol evolution could be another approach to
solve some of the issues radio access networks experience, which cause them to
rely on network management middleboxes. By removing problems at the transport
layer, reliance on expensive and complex middleboxes could decrease.</t>

<section anchor="sending-data-up-down-for-network-management-benefits" title="Sending Data Up/Down for Network Management Benefits">

<t>Collaboration between network elements and endpoints could bring about
better content distribution. A number of suggestions were given; these
included the following:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Mobile Throughput Guidance <xref target="MTG"/>: exchanges metadata
  between network elements and endpoints via TCP options. It also allows for
  better understanding of how the transport protocol behaves and further improves
  the user experience, although additional work on MTG is still
  required.</t>
  <t>Session Protocol for User Datagrams <xref target="SPUD"/>: a UDP-based encapsulation protocol to allow
  explicit cooperation with middleboxes while using, new encrypted transport
  protocols.</t>
  <t>Network Status API: an API for operators to share congestion status or
  the state of a cell before an application starts sending data that could allow applications to change their behavior.</t>
  <t>Traffic Classification: classifying traffic and adding these classifications as metadata for analysis throughout the network. This idea has trust and privacy implications.</t>
  <t>Congestion Exposure <xref target="CONEX"/>: a mechanism where senders inform the network about the congestion encountered by previous packets on the same flow, in-band at the IP layer.</t>
  <t>Latency versus Bandwidth: a bit that allows the content provider to
  indicate whether higher bandwidth or lower latency is of greater priority
  and allows the network to react based on that indication. Where this bit
  resides in the protocol stack and how it is authenticated would need to be
  decided.</t> 
  <t>No Network Management Tools: disabling all network management tools
  from the network and relying only on end-to-end protocols to manage
  congestion.</t>

  <t>Flow Queue Controlled Delay (FQ-CoDel) <xref target="FLOWQUEUE"/>: a hybrid packet scheduler / Active Queue Management (AQM) <xref target="RFC7567"/> algorithm aiming to reduce bufferbloat and latency. FQ-CoDel manages packets from multiple flows and reduces the impact of head-of-line blocking from bursty traffic.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Some of these suggestions rely on signaling from network elements to
endpoints.  Others aim to create "hop-by-hop" solutions, which could be more
aligned with how congestion is managed today but with greater privacy
implications.</t>

<t>Still others rely on signaling from endpoints to network elements. Some of
these rely on implicit signaling and others on explicit signaling. Some workshop attendees agreed that relying on applications to explicitly declare the quality of service they require was not a good path forward given the lack of success with this model in the past.</t>

<section anchor="competition-cooperation-and-mobile-network-complexities" title="Competition, Cooperation, and Mobile Network Complexities">

<t>One of the larger issues in sharing data about the problems encountered
with encrypted traffic in wireless networks is the matter of competition;
network operators are reluctant to relinquish data about their own networks
because it contains information that is valuable to competitors, and
application providers wish to protect their users and reveal as little
information as possible to the network. Some people think that if middleboxes
were authenticated and invoked explicitly, this would be an improvement over
current transparent middleboxes that intercept traffic without endpoint
consent.  Some workshop attendees suggested any exchange of information should
be bidirectional in an effort to improve cooperation between the elements. A
robust incentive framework could provide a solution to these issues or at
least help mitigate them.</t>

<t>The radio access network is complex because it must deal with a number of conflicting demands. Base stations reflect this environment, and information within these base stations can be of value to other entities on the path. Some workshop participants thought solutions for managing congestion on radio networks should involve the base station if possible. For instance, understanding how the radio resource controller and AQM <xref target="RFC7567"/> interact (or don't interact) could provide valuable information for solving issues. Although many workshop attendees agreed that even though there is a need to understand the base station, not all agreed that the base station should be part of a future solution.</t>

<t>Some suggested solutions were based on network categorization and on providing this information to the protocols or endpoints. Completely categorizing radio networks could be impossible due to their complexity, but categorizing essential network properties could be possible and valuable.</t>

</section>

</section>
<section anchor="transport-layer-issues-optimisation-and-solutions" title="Transport Layer: Issues, Optimization, and Solutions">

<t>TCP has been the dominant transport protocol since TCP/IP replaced the
Network Control Protocol (NCP) on the ARPANET in March 1983. TCP was originally devised to work on a
specific network model that did not anticipate the high error rates and highly
variable available bandwidth scenarios experienced on modern radio access
networks. Furthermore, new network elements have been introduced (NATs and
network devices with large buffers creating bufferbloat), and considerable
peer-to-peer traffic is competing with traditional client-server
traffic. Consequently, the transport layer today has requirements beyond what
TCP was designed to meet. TCP has other issues as well; too many services rely
on TCP and only TCP, blocking deployment of new transport protocols like
the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) and Datagram Congestion Control
Protocol (DCCP). This means that true innovation on the transport layer becomes
difficult because deployment issues are more complicated than just building a
new protocol.</t>

<t>The IETF is trying to solve these issues through the IAB's IP Stack
Evolution program, and the first step in this program is to collect data.
Network and content providers can provide data including: the cost of
encryption, the advantages of network management tools, the deployment of
protocols, and the effects when network management tools are disabled.  For
mostly competitive reasons, network operators do not tend to reveal network
information and so are unlikely to donate this information freely to the
IETF.  The GSMA is in a position to try to collect this data and anonymize it
before bringing it to IETF, which should alleviate the network operator
worries but still provide IETF with some usable data.</t>

<t>Although congestion is only detected when packet loss is encountered and
better methods based on detecting congestion would be beneficial, a
considerable amount of work has already been done on TCP, especially
innovation in bandwidth management and congestion control.</t>

<t>Furthermore, although the deficiencies of TCP are often considered key
issues in the evolution of the Internet protocol stack, the main route to
resolve these issues may not be a new TCP, but an evolved stack. Some workshop
participants suggested that SPUD <xref target="SPUD"/> and Information-Centric
Networking (ICN) <xref target="RFC7476"/> may help
here. Quick UDP Internet Connection <xref target="QUIC"/> engineers stated that the problems solved by QUIC are general problems, rather than TCP issues. This view was not shared by all attendees of the workshop. Moreover, TCP has had some improvements in the last few years, which may mean some of the network lower layers should be investigated to see whether improvements can be made.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="application-layer-optimisation-caching-and-cdns" title="Application-Layer Optimization, Caching, and CDNs">

<t>Many discussions on the effects of encrypted traffic on radio access
networks happen between implementers and the network operators. This session
aimed to gather the opinions of the content and caching providers regarding
their experiences running over mobile networks, the quality of experience
their users expect, and the content and caching that providers would like to
achieve by working with or using the mobile network.</t>

<t>Content providers explained how even though this workshop cited encrypted
data over radio access networks as the main issue, the real issue is network
management generally, and all actors (applications providers, networks, and
devices) need to work together to overcome these general network management
issues. Content providers explained how they assume the mobile networks are
standards compliant. When the network is not standards compliant (e.g., using
non-standards-compliant intermediaries), content providers can experience real
costs as users contact their support centers to report issues that are
difficult to test for and resolve.</t>

<t>Content providers cited other common issues concerning data traffic over
mobile networks. Data subscription limits (known as "caps") cause issues for users;
users are confused about how data caps work or are unsure how expensive media
is and how much data it consumes. Developers build products on networks not
indicative of the networks their customers are using, and not every
organization has the finances to build a caching infrastructure.</t>

<t>Strongly related to content providers, content owners consider CDNs to be
trusted deliverers of content, and CDNs have shown great success in fixed
networks. Now that more traffic is moving to mobile networks, there is a need
to place caches near the user at the edge of the mobile network. Placing
caches at the edge of the mobile network is a solution, but it requires standards
developed by content providers and mobile network operators. The IETF's CDN
Interconnection <xref target="CDNI"/> Working
Group aims to allow global CDNs to interoperate
with mobile CDNs, but this causes huge issues for the caching of encrypted
data between these CDNs. Some CDNs are experimenting with approaches like
"Keyless SSL" <xref target="KeylessSSL"/> to enable safer storage of content
without passing private keys to the CDN. Blind Caching <xref
target="BLIND_CACHING"/> is another proposal aimed at caching encrypted content
closer to the user and managing the authentication at the original content
provider servers.</t>

<t>At the end of the session, each panelist was asked to identify one key
collaborative work item. Work items named were: evolving to cache encrypted
content, using one bit for latency / bandwidth trade-off (explained below),
better collaboration between the network and application, better metrics to
aid troubleshooting and innovation, and indications from the network to allow
the application to adapt.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="technical-analysis-and-response-to-potential-regulatory-reaction" title="Technical Analysis and Response to Potential Regulatory Reaction">

<t>This session was conducted under the Chatham House Rule. The session aimed to
discuss regulatory and political issues, but not their worth or need, and to understand the laws that exist and how technologists can properly respond to them.</t>

<t>Mobile networks are regulated; compliance is mandatory and can incur costs
on the mobile network operator, while non-compliance can result in service
license revocation in some nations. Regulation does vary geographically. Some
regulations are court orders and others are self-imposed regulations, for
example, "block lists" of websites such as the Internet Watch Foundation <xref target="IWF"/> list. Operators are not expected to decrypt sites, so those
encrypted sites will not be blocked because of content.</t>

<t>Parental-control-type filters also exist on the network and are easily
bypassed today, vastly limiting their effectiveness. Better solutions would
allow for users to easily set these restrictions themselves. Other regulations
are also hard to meet, such as user data patterns, or will become harder to
collect, such as Internet of Things (IoT) cases. Most attendees agreed that if
a government cannot get information it needs (and is legally entitled to have)
from network operators, they will approach content providers. Some governments
are aware of the impact of encryption and are working with, or trying to work
with, content providers. The IAB has concluded that blocking and filtering can be
done at the endpoints of the communication.</t>

<t>Not all of these regulations apply to the Internet, and the Internet
community is not always aware of their existence. Collectively, the Internet
community can work with GSMA and 3GPP and act together to alleviate the risk
imposed by encrypted traffic. Some participants expressed concern that
governments might require operators to provide information that they no longer
have the ability to provide because previously unencrypted traffic is now
being encrypted, and this might expose operators to new liability, but no
specific examples were given during the workshop. A suggestion from some
attendees was that if any new technical solutions are necessary, they should
easily be "switched off".</t>

<t>Some mobile network operators are producing transparency reports covering regulations including lawful intercept. Operators who have done this already are encouraging others to do the same.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="suggested-principles-and-solutions" title="Suggested Principles and Solutions">

<t>Based on the talks and discussions throughout the workshop, a set of
suggested principles and solutions has been collected. This is not an
exhaustive list, and no attempt was made to come to consensus during the
workshop, so there are likely at least some participants who would not agree
with any particular principle listed below. The list is a union of participant
thinking, not an intersection.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Encrypted Traffic: Any solution should encourage and support encrypted traffic.</t>
  <t>Flexibility: Radio access network qualities vary vastly, and the network
  needs of content can differ significantly, so any new solution should be
  flexible across either the network type, content type, or both.</t>
  <t>Privacy: New solutions should not introduce new ways for information to be discovered and attributed to individual users.</t>
  <t>Minimum data only for collaborative work: User data, application data, and network data all need protection, so new solutions should use minimal information to make a working solution.</t>
</list></t>

<t>A collection of solutions suggested by various participants during the workshop is given below. Inclusion in this list does not imply that other workshop participants agreed. Again, the list is a union of proposed solutions, not an intersection.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Evolving TCP or evolution on the transport layer: This could take a
  number of forms, and some of this work is already underway within the
  IETF.</t>
  <t>Congestion Control: Many attendees cited congestion control as a key issue. Further analysis, investigation, and work could be done in this space.</t>
  <t>Sprout <xref target="SPROUT"/>: Researched at MIT, Sprout is a transport protocol for applications that desire high throughput and low delay.</t>

  <t>PCC <xref target="PCC"/>: Performance-oriented Congestion Control is a new architecture that aims for consistent high performance, even in challenging scenarios. PCC endpoints observe the connection between their actions and their known performance, which allows them to adapt their actions.</t>
  <t>CDNs and Caches: This suggests that placing caches closer to the edge of the radio network, as close as possible to the mobile user, or making more intelligent CDNs, would result in faster content delivery and less strain on the network.</t>
  <t>Blind Caching <xref target="BLIND_CACHING"/>: This is a proposal for caching of encrypted content.</t>
  <t>CDN Improvements: This includes Keyless SSL and better CDN placement.</t>
  <t>Mobile Throughput Guidance <xref target="MTG"/>: This is a mechanism and protocol
  elements that allow the cellular network to provide near real-time
  information on capacity available to the TCP server.</t> 
  <t>One Bit for Latency / Bandwidth Trade-Off: This suggests determining whether using a
  single bit in an unencrypted transport header to distinguish between traffic
  that the sender prefers to be queued and traffic that the sender would
  prefer to drop rather than delay provides additional benefits beyond what
  can be achieved without this signaling.</t> 
  <t>Base Station: Some suggestions involved using the base station, but this was not defined in detail. The base station holds the radio resource controller and scheduler, which could provide a place to host solutions, or data from the base station could help in devising new solutions.</t>
  <t>Identify Traffic Types via 5-Tuple: Information from the 5-tuple could provide understanding of the traffic type, and network management appropriate for that traffic type could then be applied.</t>
  <t>Heuristics: Networks can sometimes identify traffic types by observing characteristics, such as data flow rate, and then apply network management to these identified flows. This is not recommended, as categorizations can be incorrect.</t>
  <t>APIs: An API for operators to share congestion status or the state of a
  cell before an application starts sending data could allow applications to
  change their behavior. Alternatively, an API could provide the network with
  information on the data type, allowing appropriate network
  management for that data type; however, this method exposes privacy issues.</t>
  <t>Standard approach for the operator to offer services to 
Content Providers: Mobile network operators could provide caching services or other services for content providers to use for faster and smoother content delivery.</t>
  <t>AQM <xref target="RFC7567"/> and ECN <xref target="RFC3168"/> deployments: Queuing and congestion management methods have existed for some time in the form of AQM, ECN, and others, which can help the transport and Internet protocol layers adapt to congestion faster.</t>
  <t>Trust Model or Trust Framework: Some solutions in this area (e.g., SPUD) have a reliance on trust when content providers or the network are being asked to add classifiers to their traffic.</t>
  <t>Keyless SSL <xref target="KeylessSSL"/>: This allows content providers to
  maintain their private keys on a key server and host the content elsewhere
  (e.g., on a CDN). This could become standardized in the IETF. <xref target="LURK"/></t>
  <t>Meaningful capacity sharing: This includes the ConEx <xref target="CONEX"/> work, which exposes information about congestion to the network nodes.</t>
  <t>Hop-by-hop: Some suggestions offer hop-by-hop methods that allow nodes to adapt flow given the qualities of the networks around them and the congestion they are experiencing.</t>
  <t>Metrics and metric standards: In order to evolve current protocols to be best suited to today's networks, data is needed about current network conditions, protocol deployments, packet traces, and middlebox behavior. Beyond this, proper testing and debugging on networks could provide great insight for stack evolution.</t>
  <t>5G: Mobile operator standards bodies are in the process of setting the
  requirements for 5G. Requirements for network management could be added.</t>
</list></t>

<t>In the workshop, attendees identified other areas where greater understanding could help the standards process. These were identified as:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>greater understanding of the RAN within the IETF;</t>
  <t>reviews and comments on 3GPP perspective; and,</t>
  <t>how to do congestion control in the RAN.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="better-collaboration" title="Better Collaboration">

<t>Throughout the workshop, attendees placed emphasis on the need for better collaboration between the IETF and telecommunications bodies and organizations. The workshop was one such way to achieve this, but the good work and relationships built in the workshop should continue so the two groups can work on solutions that are better for both technologies and users.</t>

<section anchor="since-marnew" title="Since MaRNEW">

<t>Since MaRNEW, a number of activities have taken place in various IETF
working groups and in groups external to IETF. The Alternatives to Content
Classification for Operator Resource Deployment (ACCORD) BoF was held at IETF
95 in November 2015, which brought the workshop discussion to the wider IETF
audiences by providing an account of the discussions that had taken place
within the workshop and highlighting key areas to progress on. Key areas to
progress on and an update on their current status are as follows:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The collection of usable metrics and data were requested by a number of MaRNEW attendees, especially for use within the IRTF Measurement and Analysis for Protocols (MAP) Research Group; this data has been difficult to collect due to the closed nature of mobile network operators.</t>
  <t>Understanding impediments to protocol stack evolution has continued
  within the IAB's IP Stack Evolution program and throughout transport-related
  IETF working groups such as the Transport Area Working Group (TSVWG).</t>

  <t>The Mobile Throughput Guidance document <xref target="MTG" /> has entered into a testing and
  data collection phase, although further advancements in transport
  technologies (QUIC, among others) may have stalled efforts in TCP-related proposals.</t>
  <t>Work on proposals for caching encrypted content continue, albeit with some security flaws that proponents are working on further proposals to fix. Most often, these are discussed within the IETF HTTPbis Working Group.</t>

  <t>The Path Layer UDP Substrate (PLUS) BOF at IETF 96 in July 2016 did not
  result in the formation of a working group, as attendees expressed concern
  on the privacy issues associated with the proposed data-sharing
  possibilities of the shim layer.</t>

  <t>The Limited Use of Remote Keys (LURK) BOF at IETF 96 in July 2016 did not result in the formation of a working group because the BOF identified more problems with the presumed approach than anticipated.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The most rewarding output of MaRNEW is perhaps the most intangible. MaRNEW gave two rather divergent industry groups the opportunity to connect and discuss common technologies and issues affecting users and operations. Mobile network providers and key Internet engineers and experts have developed a greater collaborative relationship to aid development of further standards that work across networks in a secure manner.</t>

<abstract><t>The bandwidth available for end user devices in cellular networks can vary by an order of magnitude over a few seconds due to changes in the underlying radio channel conditions, as device mobility and changes in system load as other devices enter and leave the network. Furthermore, packets losses are not always signs of congestion.  The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) can have difficulties adapting to these rapidly varying conditions leading to inefficient use of a cellular network's resources and degraded application performance. Problem statement, requirements and the architecture for a solution is documented in [Req_Arch_MTG_Exposure].  This document proposes a mechanism and protocol elements that allow the cellular network to provide near real-time information on capacity available to the TCP server.  This "Throughput Guidance" (TG) information would indicate the throughput estimated to be available at the radio downlink interface (between the Radio Access Network (RAN) and the mobile device (UE)).  TCP server can use this TG information to ensure high network utilization and high service delivery performance.  The document describes the applicability of the proposed mechanism for video delivery over cellular networks; it also presents test results from live operator's environment.</t></abstract>
