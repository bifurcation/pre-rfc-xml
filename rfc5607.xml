    <t>This document specifies Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service
       (RADIUS) attributes for authorizing management access to a Network 
        Access Server (NAS).  Both local and remote management are supported,
        with granular access rights and management privileges.  Specific
        provisions are made for remote management via Framed Management
        protocols and for management access over a secure transport protocol.

        <section title="Introduction">
        <t>
        RFC 2865 <xref target="RFC2865"/> defines the NAS-Prompt (7) and Administrative (6) values of 
        the Service-Type (6) Attribute.   Both of these values provide access to 
        the interactive, text-based Command Line Interface (CLI) of the NAS, 
        and were originally developed to control access to the physical
        console port of the NAS, most often a serial port.
        </t>
        
        <t>Remote access to the CLI of the NAS has been available in NAS 
        implementations for many years, using protocols such as Telnet,
        Rlogin, and the remote terminal service of the Secure SHell (SSH).  In order to distinguish
        local, physical, console access from remote access, the NAS-Port-Type (61)
        Attribute is generally included in Access-Request and Access-Accept
        messages, along with the Service-Type (6) Attribute, to indicate the form 
        of access.  A NAS-Port-Type (61) Attribute with a value of Async (0) is used to signify a local
        serial port connection, while a value of Virtual (5) is used to
        signify a remote connection, via a remote terminal protocol.  This
        usage provides no selectivity among the various available remote
        terminal protocols (e.g., Telnet, Rlogin, SSH, etc.).
        </t>
        
       <t>Today, it is common for network devices to support more than the two
       privilege levels for management access provided by the Service-Type (6)
       Attribute with values of NAS-Prompt (7)
       (non-privileged) and Administrative (6) (privileged).  Also, other 
       management mechanisms may be used, such as Web-based management,
       the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), and the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF).  
       To provide support for these additional features, this specification 
       defines attributes for Framed Management protocols, management protocol 
       security, and management access privilege levels.
       </t>
       
       <t>Remote management via the command line is carried over
       protocols such as Telnet, Rlogin, and the remote terminal
       service of SSH.  Since these protocols are primarily for the
       delivery of terminal or terminal emulation services, the term
       "Framed Management" is used to describe management protocols
       supporting techniques other than the command line.  Typically,
       these mechanisms format management information in a binary or
       textual encoding such as HTML, XML, or ASN.1/BER.  Examples
       include Web-based management (HTML over HTTP or HTTPS), NETCONF
       (XML over SSH or BEEP or SOAP), and SNMP (SMI over ASN.1/BER).
       Command line interface, menu interface, or other text-based
       (e.g., ASCII or UTF-8) terminal emulation services are not
       considered to be Framed Management protocols.

        <section title="Terminology">
        <t>
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
        "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
        and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        This document uses terminology from RFC 2865 <xref target="RFC2865"/>, RFC 2866 <xref target="RFC2866"/>,
        and RFC 5176 <xref target="RFC5176"/>.
        </t>
            <t> The term "integrity protection", as used in this document, is 
                *not* the same as "authentication", as used in SNMP.  Integrity 
                protection requires the sharing of cryptographic keys, but it 
                does not require authenticated principals.  Integrity protection 
                could be used, for example, with anonymous Diffie-Hellman key 
                agreement.  In SNMP, the proof of identity of the principals 
                (authentication) is conflated with tamper-resistance of the 
                protected messages (integrity). In this document, we assume that 
                integrity protection and authentication are separate concerns.  
                Authentication is part of the base RADIUS protocol.
            </t>
            <t> SNMP uses the terms "auth" and "noAuth", as well as "priv" and 
                "noPriv".  There is no analog to auth or noAuth in this 
                document.  In this document, we are assuming that authentication 
                always occurs when it is required, i.e., as a prerequisite to 
                provisioning of access via an Access-Accept packet.
            </t>
        </section>
        
        <section title="Overview">
        <t>To support the authorization and provisioning of Framed Management
        access to managed entities, this document introduces a new value for
        the Service-Type (6) Attribute <xref target="RFC2865"/> and one new attribute.  The new
        value for the Service-Type (6) Attribute is Framed-Management (18), used for
        remote device management via a Framed Management protocol.  The new
        attribute is Framed-Management-Protocol (133), the value of which specifies a 
        particular protocol for use in the remote management session.
        </t>
        
        <t>Two new attributes are introduced in this document in support of
        granular management access rights or command privilege levels.
        The Management-Policy-Id (135) Attribute provides a text string
        specifying a policy name of local scope, that is assumed to have
        been pre-provisioned on the NAS.  This use of an attribute to 
        specify use of a pre-provisioned policy is similar to 
        the Filter-Id (11) Attribute defined in <xref target="RFC2865"/> Section 5.11.
        </t>
        
        <t>The local application of the Management-Policy-Id (135) Attribute within the managed
        entity may take the form of (a) one of an enumeration of command
        privilege levels, (b) a mapping into an SNMP Access Control Model,
        such as the View-Based Access Control Model (VACM) <xref target="RFC3415"/>, or (c)
        some other set of management access policy rules that is mutually
        understood by the managed entity and the remote management
        application.  Examples are given in <xref target="EXAMPLES"/>.
        </t>
        
        <t>The Management-Privilege-Level (136) Attribute contains an
        integer-valued management privilege level indication.  This attribute
        serves to modify or augment the management permissions provided by
        the NAS-Prompt (7) value of the Service-Type (6) Attribute, and thus applies to 
        CLI management.
        </t>

        <t>To enable management security requirements to be specified, the
        Management-Transport-Protection (134) Attribute is introduced.  The value 
        of this attribute indicates the minimum level of secure transport 
        protocol protection required for the provisioning of NAS-Prompt (7),
        Administrative (6), or Framed-Management (18) service.   
        </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Domain of Applicability">
            <t>
                Most of the RADIUS attributes defined in this document have broad applicability for provisioning
                local and remote management access to NAS devices.  However, those attributes that provision
                remote access over Framed Management protocols and over secure transports have special considerations. 
                This document does not specify the
                details of the integration of these protocols with a RADIUS client in the NAS implementation.
                However, there are functional
                requirements for correct application of Framed Management protocols and/or secure transport protocols that
                will limit the selection of
                such protocols that can be considered for use with RADIUS.  Since the RADIUS user credentials are
                typically obtained by the RADIUS client from the secure transport protocol server or the 
                Framed Management protocol server, the
                protocol, and its implementation in the NAS, MUST support forms of credentials that are compatible with the
                authentication methods supported by RADIUS.
            </t>
            <t>
                RADIUS currently supports the following user authentication methods, although others may be
                added in the future:

             <list style="symbols">
                 <t>
                 Password - RFC 2865
                 </t>
                 <t>
                 CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol) - RFC 2865
                 </t>
                 <t>
                 ARAP (Apple Remote Access Protocol) - RFC 2869
                 </t>
                 <t>
                 EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) - RFC 2869, RFC 3579
                 </t>
                 <t>
                 HTTP Digest - RFC 5090
                 </t>
                 </list>


The remote management protocols selected for use with the RADIUS
             remote NAS management sessions, for example, those
             described in <xref target="FMP"/>, and the secure
             transport protocols selected to meet the protection
             requirements, as described in <xref target="MTP"/>,
             obviously need to support user authentication methods
             that are compatible with those that exist in RADIUS.  The
             RADIUS authentication methods most likely usable with
             these protocols are Password, CHAP, and possibly HTTP
             Digest, with Password being the distinct common
             denominator.  There are many secure transports that
             support other, more robust, authentication mechanisms,
             such as public key.  RADIUS has no support for public key
             authentication, except within the context of an EAP
             Method.  The applicability statement for EAP indicates
             that it is not intended for use as an application-layer
             authentication mechanism, so its use with the mechanisms
             described in this document is NOT RECOMMENDED.  In some
             cases, Password may be the only compatible RADIUS
             authentication method available.
            </t>

            <section title="Service-Type">
            <t>
            The Service-Type (6) Attribute is defined in Section 5.6 of RFC 2865 
            <xref target="RFC2865"/>. This document defines a new value of the
            Service-Type Attribute, as follows:

<section title="New RADIUS Attributes">
<t>
This document defines four new RADIUS attributes related to management authorization.
</t>
            
<section title="Framed-Management-Protocol" anchor="FMP">
<t>
The Framed-Management-Protocol (133) Attribute indicates the application-layer management
protocol to be used for Framed Management access.  It MAY be used in both Access-Request
and Access-Accept packets.  This attribute is used in conjunction with a Service-Type (6)
Attribute with the value of Framed-Management (18).
</t>

<t>
It is RECOMMENDED that the NAS include an appropriately valued
Framed-Management-Protocol (133) Attribute in an Access-Request packet, indicating
the type of management access being requested.  It is further
RECOMMENDED that the NAS include a Service-Type (6) Attribute with the value
Framed-Management (18) in the same Access-Request packet.  The RADIUS
server MAY use these attributes as a hint in making its authorization decision.
</t>

<t>
The RADIUS server MAY include a Framed-Management-Protocol (133) Attribute in an
Access-Accept packet that also includes a Service-Type (6) Attribute with a
value of Framed-Management (18), when the RADIUS server chooses to enforce a
management access policy for the authenticated user that dictates one form
of management access in preference to others.
</t>

<t>
When a NAS receives a Framed-Management-Protocol (133) Attribute in an
Access-Accept packet, it MUST deliver that specified form of management
access or disconnect the session.  If the NAS does not support the
provisioned management application-layer protocol, or the management access
protocol requested by the user does not match that of the
Framed-Management-Protocol (133) Attribute in the Access-Accept packet, the NAS
MUST treat the Access-Accept packet as if it had been an Access-Reject.

A summary of the Framed-Management-Protocol (133) Attribute format is shown below.

            The Management-Transport-Protection (134) Attribute specifies the minimum level of
            protection that is required for a protected transport used
            with the Framed or non-Framed Management access session.  The protected
            transport used by the NAS MAY provide a greater level of protection,
            but MUST NOT provide a lower level of protection.
            </t>
            
            <t>
            When a secure form of non-Framed Management access is specified,
            it means that the remote terminal session is encapsulated
            in some form of protected transport, or tunnel. It may also mean that an explicit
            secure mode of operation is required, when the Framed Management
            protocol contains an intrinsic secure mode of operation. The Management-Transport-Protection (134) Attribute
            does not apply to CLI access via a local serial port, or other non-remote connection.
            </t>
            
            <t>
            When a secure form of Framed Management access is specified, it means that the application-layer
            management protocol is encapsulated in some form of protected
            transport, or tunnel.  It may also mean that an explicit
            secure mode of operation is required, when the Framed Management
            protocol contains an intrinsic secure mode of operation.
            </t>
            
            <t>
            A value of "No Protection (1)" indicates that a secure transport protocol is not required, and
            that the NAS SHOULD accept a connection over any transport associated with the
            application-layer management protocol.  The definitions of management application 
            to transport bindings are defined in the relevant documents that specify those management 
            application protocols.  The same "No Protection" semantics are conveyed by omitting this attribute
            from an Access-Accept packet.

            <t>
            Specific protected transport protocols, cipher suites, key agreement methods, or authentication methods

            <t>
            It is RECOMMENDED that the NAS include an appropriately valued Management-Transport-Protection (134) Attribute
            in an Access-Request packet, indicating the level of transport protection for the management access being
            requested, when that information is available to the RADIUS client.  The RADIUS server MAY use this
            attribute as a hint in making its authorization decision.
            </t>
            
            <t>
            The RADIUS server MAY include a Management-Transport-Protection (134) Attribute in an Access-Accept packet that
            also includes a Service-Type (6) Attribute with a value of Framed-Management (18), when the RADIUS server chooses
            to enforce an management access security policy for the authenticated user that dictates a minimum level
            of transport security.
            </t>
            
            <t>
            When a NAS receives a Management-Transport-Protection (134) Attribute in an Access-Accept packet, it MUST deliver
            the management access over a transport with equal or better protection characteristics or disconnect the session.
            If the NAS does not support protected management transport protocols, or the level of protection available does
            not match that of the Management-Transport-Protection (134) Attribute in the Access-Accept packet, the NAS MUST treat
            the response packet as if it had been an Access-Reject.

            <t>
            The Management-Policy-Id (135) Attribute indicates the name of the 
            management access policy for this user.  Zero or one Management-
            Policy-Id (135) Attributes MAY be sent in an Access-Accept packet.  
            Identifying a policy by name allows the policy to be used on 
            different NASes without regard to implementation details.
            </t>
            
            <t>
            Multiple forms of management access rules may be expressed by the 
            underlying named policy, the definition of which is beyond the scope 
            of this document. The management access policy MAY be applied 
            contextually, based on the nature of the management access method.  
            For example, some named policies may only be valid for application to 
            NAS-Prompt (7) services and some other policies may only be valid for SNMP.
            </t>
            
            <t>
            The management access policy named in this attribute, received in an 
            Access-Accept packet, MUST be applied to the session authorized by 
            the Access-Accept.  If the NAS supports this attribute, but the policy name is unknown, or 
            if the RADIUS client is able to determine that the policy 
            rules are incorrectly formatted, the NAS MUST treat the Access-Accept packet as if it 
            had been an Access-Reject.
            </t>
            
            <t>
            No precedence relationship is defined for multiple occurrences of the Management-Policy-Id (135) Attribute.  
            NAS behavior in such cases is undefined.  Therefore, two or more occurrences of this attribute SHOULD NOT be
            included in an Access-Accept or CoA-Request (Change-of-Authorization).  In the absence of 
            further specification defining some sort of precedence relationship, 
            it is not possible to guarantee multi-vendor interoperability when
            using multiple instances of this attribute in a single Access-Accept
            or CoA-Request packet.
            </t>
            
            <t>
            The content of the Management-Policy-Id (135) Attribute is expected to be the name of a management access
            policy of local significance to the NAS, within a namespace of significance to the NAS.  In
            this regard, the behavior is similar to that for the Filter-Id (11) Attribute.  The policy names and rules are
            committed to the local configuration data-store of the NAS, and are provisioned by means beyond the scope of
            this document, such as via SNMP, NETCONF, or CLI.
            </t>
            
            <t>
            The namespace used in the Management-Policy-Id (135) Attribute is simple and monolithic.  There
            is no explicit or implicit structure or hierarchy.  For example, in the text string "example.com",
            the "." (period or dot) is just another character.  It is expected that text string matching will be performed
            without parsing the text string into any sub-fields.
            </t>
            
            <t>
            Overloading or subdividing this simple name with multi-part specifiers (e.g., Access=remote, Level=7)
            is likely to lead to poor multi-vendor interoperability and SHOULD NOT be utilized.  If a simple,
            unstructured policy name is not sufficient, it is RECOMMENDED that
            a Vendor Specific (26) Attribute be used instead, rather than overloading the semantics of
            Management-Policy-Id.

        The Management-Privilege-Level (136) Attribute indicates the integer-valued
        privilege level to be assigned for management access for the authenticated
        user.   Many NASes provide the notion of differentiated management privilege
        levels denoted by an integer value.  The specific access rights conferred by
        each value are implementation dependent.  It MAY be used in both Access-Request

        The mapping of integer values for this attribute to specific collections
        of management access rights or permissions on the NAS is vendor and
        implementation specific.  Such mapping is often a user-configurable

        It is RECOMMENDED to limit use of the Management-Privilege-Level (136) Attribute to sessions where the 
        Service-Type (6) Attribute
        has a value of NAS-Prompt (7) (not Administrative).  Typically, NASes treat NAS-Prompt as the minimal
        privilege CLI service and Administrative as full privilege.  Using the 
        Management-Privilege-Level (136) Attribute with a Service-Type (6) Attribute having a value of NAS-Prompt (7)
        will have the effect of increasing the minimum privilege level.  Conversely, it is NOT RECOMMENDED
        to use this attribute with a Service-Type (6) Attribute with a value of Administrative (6), which may require decreasing the
        maximum privilege level.
        </t>
        <t>
        It is NOT RECOMMENDED to use the Management-Privilege-Level (136) Attribute in combination with a

        for management access methods other than interactive CLI.  The behavior resulting from such an overlay
        of management access control provisioning is not defined by this document, and in the absence of further
        specification, is likely to lead to unexpected behaviors, especially in multi-vendor environments.

        <section title="Use with Dynamic Authorization">
        <t>
        It is entirely OPTIONAL for the NAS management authorization attributes specified in this document
        to be used in conjunction with Dynamic Authorization extensions to RADIUS <xref target="RFC5176" />.
        When such usage occurs, those attributes MAY be used as listed in the Table of Attributes in <xref target="TOA" />.
        </t>
        <t>
        Some guidance on how to identify existing management sessions on a NAS for the purposes of
        Dynamic Authorization is useful.  The primary session identifiers SHOULD be User-Name (1) and Service-Type (6).  To accommodate
        instances when that information alone does not uniquely identify a session, a NAS supporting Dynamic Authorization SHOULD
        maintain one or more internal session identifiers that can be represented as RADIUS attributes.  Examples of such 
        attributes include Acct-Session-Id (44), Acct-Multi-Session-Id (50),
        NAS-Port (5), or NAS-Port-Id (87).  In the case of a remote management session, common identifier values might include things such
        as the remote IP address and remote TCP port number, or the file descriptor value for use with the open socket.  Any
        such identifier is obviously transient in nature, and implementations SHOULD take care to avoid and/or properly 
        handle duplicate or stale values.
        </t>
        <t>
        In order for the session identification attributes to be available to the Dynamic Authorization Client, a NAS supporting
        Dynamic Authorization for management sessions SHOULD include those session identification attributes in the Access-Request message
        for each such session.
        Additional discussion of session identification attribute usage may be found in Section 3 of <xref target="RFC5176" />.

(Note 1) When included within a CoA-Request, these attributes
  represent an authorization change request.  When one of these
  attributes is omitted from a CoA-Request, the NAS assumes that the
  attribute value is to remain unchanged.  Attributes included in a
  CoA-Request replace all existing values of the same attribute(s).

The following table defines the meaning of the above table entries.

    0    This attribute MUST NOT be present in a packet.
    0+   Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present in
         a packet.
    0-1  Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present in
         a packet.
    1    Exactly one instance of this attribute MUST be present in

   in transit.  They do not prevent an authorized RADIUS/Diameter server
   or proxy from inserting attributes with malicious intent.
   </t>
   
   <t>A legacy NAS may not recognize the attributes in this document
  that supplement the provisioning of CLI management access.  If
  the value of the Service-Type Attribute is NAS-Prompt or 
  Administrative, the legacy NAS may silently discard such 
  attributes, while permitting the user to access the CLI
  management interface(s) of the NAS.  This can lead to users
  improperly receiving authorized management access to the NAS,
  or access with greater levels of access rights than were intended.
  RADIUS servers SHOULD attempt to ascertain whether or not the
  NAS supports these attributes before sending them in an 
  Access-Accept message that provisions CLI access.
   </t>
   
   <t>
   It is possible that certain NAS implementations may not be able to determine the protection properties of the
   underlying transport protocol as specified by the Management-Transport-Protection Attribute.  This may be
   a limitation of the standard application programming interface of the underlying transport implementation or of the integration
   of the transport into the NAS implementation.  In either event, NASes conforming to this specification, 
   which cannot determine the protection state of the remote management connection, MUST treat an Access-Accept 
   message containing a Management-Transport-Protection Attribute containing a value other than No-Protection (1) as if it
   were an Access-Reject message, unless specifically overridden by local policy configuration.
   </t> 
       <t>
           Use of the No-Protection (1) option for the 
           Management-Transport-Protection (134) Attribute is NOT RECOMMENDED 
           in any deployment where secure management or configuration is 
           required.

   <section title="RADIUS Proxy Operation Considerations">
        <t>
        The device management access authorization attributes presented in this 
        document present certain considerations when used in RADIUS proxy environments.
        These considerations are not different from those that exist in RFC 2865 <xref target="RFC2865"/>
        with respect to the Service-Type Attribute values of Administrative and NAS-Prompt.
        </t>
        <t>
        Most RADIUS proxy environments are also multi-party environments.  In multi-party
        proxy environments it is important to distinguish which entities have the
        authority to provision management access to the edge devices, i.e., NASes,
        and which entities only have authority to provision network access services of
        various sorts.
        </t>
        <t>
        It may be important that operators of the NAS are able to ensure that access 
        to the CLI, or other management interfaces of the NAS, is only provisioned to 
        their own employees or contractors.  One way for the NAS to enforce this requirement is to use
        only local, non-proxy RADIUS servers for management access requests.  Proxy RADIUS 
        servers could be used for non-management access requests, based on local policy.
        This "bifurcation" of RADIUS authentication and authorization is a simple case of 
        separate administrative realms.  The NAS may be designed so as to maintain separate
        lists of RADIUS servers for management AAA use and for non-management AAA use.
        </t>
        <t>
        An alternate method of enforcing this requirement would be for the first-hop
        RADIUS proxy server, operated by the owner of the NAS, to filter out any RADIUS attributes
        that provision management access rights that originate from "up-stream" proxy
        servers not operated by the NAS owner.  Access-Accept messages that provision
        such locally unauthorized management access MAY be treated as if they were an
        Access-Reject by the first-hop proxy server.
        </t>
        <t>
        An additional exposure present in proxy deployments is that sensitive user credentials, e.g., passwords,
        are likely to be available in cleartext form at each of the proxy servers.  Encrypted or hashed credentials
        are not subject to this risk, but password authentication is a very commonly used mechanism
        for management access authentication, and in RADIUS passwords are only protected on a hop-by-hop basis.
        Malicious proxy servers could misuse this sensitive information.
        </t>
        <t>
        These issues are not of concern when all the RADIUS servers, local and proxy, used by the NAS
        are under the sole administrative control of the NAS owner.
