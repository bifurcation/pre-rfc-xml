This memo defines the procedure used to update the IANA Language Subtag
Registry, in conjunction with the publication of RFC 5646, for use in forming tags for
identifying languages.
</t>
</abstract>

<section title="Introduction">
<t>
<xref target="RFC4646" /> provides for a Language Subtag Registry and
describes its format.  The initial contents of the registry and rules
for determining them are specified in <xref target="RFC4645" />.
</t>
<t>
<xref target="RFC5646" /> expands on <xref target="RFC4646" />
by adding support for approximately 7,500 new primary and extended language
subtags based on <xref target="ISO639-3" /> and <xref target="ISO639-5" />
alpha-3 code elements, and seven new region subtags based on
<xref target="ISO3166-1" /> exceptionally reserved code elements.  This memo
describes the process of updating the registry to include these additional
subtags and to make secondary changes to the registry that result from
adding the new subtags and from other decisions made by the Language Tag
Registry Update (LTRU) Working Group.
</t>
<t>
In writing this document, a complete replacement of the contents of
the Language Subtag Registry was provided to the Internet Assigned
Numbers Authority (IANA) to record the necessary updates.
</t>
<t>
The format of the Language Subtag Registry as well as the definition and
intended purpose of each of the fields are described in <xref target="RFC5646" />.
</t>
<t>
The registry is expected to change over time, as new subtags are registered
and existing subtags are modified or deprecated.  The process of updating
the registry is described in Section 3 of <xref target="RFC5646" />.
</t>
<t>
Many of the subtags defined in the Language Subtag Registry are based on
code elements defined in <xref target="ISO639-1" />,
<xref target="ISO639-2" />, <xref target="ISO639-3" />,
<xref target="ISO639-5" />, <xref target="ISO3166-1" />,
<xref target="ISO15924" />, and <xref target="UN_M.49" />.  The registry is
not a mirror of the code lists defined by these standards and should not
be used as one.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Updating the Registry">
<t>
This section describes the process for determining the updated contents
of the Language Subtag Registry.
</t>

<section title="Starting Point">
<t>
The version of the Language Subtag Registry that was current at the time
of IESG approval of this memo served as the starting point for this
update.  This version was created according to the process described in
<xref target="RFC4645" /> and maintained according to the process
described in <xref target="RFC4646" />.
</t>
<t>
The source data for <xref target="ISO639-3" /> used for this update
consisted of three files, available from the official site of the ISO
639-3 Registration Authority. (Note that this file is updated from time
to time.  The version used in the preparation of this memo was the one
in place on February 24, 2009.)
<list style="symbols">
<t>
<xref target="iso-639-3_20090210" /> is a list of all language code
elements in <xref target="ISO639-3" />, including the alpha-3 code
element and reference name for each code element.  For example, the
entry for the Dari language contained the code element &lsquo;prs&rsquo;
and the name &ldquo;Dari&rdquo; (among other information).
</t>
<t>
<xref target="iso-639-3_Name_Index_20090210" /> is a list containing
all names associated with each language according to
<xref target="ISO639-3" />, including both inverted and non-inverted
forms where appropriate.  An &ldquo;inverted&rdquo; name is one that is
altered from the usual English-language order by moving adjectival
qualifiers to the end, after the main language name and separated by
a comma.  A code element may have more than one entry in this file; the
reference name and its inverted form are usually, but not always, given
in the first entry.  For example, this file contained an entry for the
code element &lsquo;prs&rsquo; with the name &ldquo;Dari&rdquo; (twice)
and another entry with the names &ldquo;Eastern Farsi&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Farsi, Eastern&rdquo;.
</t>
<t>
<xref target="iso-639-3-macrolanguages_20090120" /> is a list of all
alpha-3 code elements for languages that are encompassed by a
macrolanguage in <xref target="ISO639-3" />, together with the alpha-3
code element for the macrolanguage.  For example, a line containing the
code elements &lsquo;fas&rsquo; and &lsquo;prs&rsquo; indicated that the
macrolanguage &ldquo;Persian&rdquo; encompasses the individual language
&ldquo;Dari&rdquo;.  (Note that these alpha-3 code elements may not have
corresponded directly to subtags in the registry, which uses 2-letter
subtags derived from <xref target="ISO639-1" /> when possible.)
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
The source data for <xref target="ISO639-5" /> used for this update
consisted of one file, available from the official site of the ISO 639-5
Registration Authority. (Note that this file is updated from time
to time.  The version used in the preparation of this memo was the one
in place on February 24, 2009.)
<list style="symbols">
<t>
<xref target="iso639-5.tab.txt" /> is a list of all language code
elements in <xref target="ISO639-5" />, including the alpha-3 code
elements and English name for each code element.  For example, this file
includes an entry containing the code element &lsquo;ira&rsquo; and the
name &ldquo;Iranian languages&ldquo; (among other information).
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
Language code elements that were already retired in all of the source
standards prior to IESG approval of this memo were not listed in these
files and, consequently, were not considered in this update.
</t>
<t>
The values of the File-Date field, the Added date for each new subtag
record, and the Deprecated date for each existing grandfathered or
redundant tag deprecated by this update were set to a date as near as
practical to the date this memo was approved for publication by IESG.
</t>
</section>

<section title="New Language Subtags" anchor="new-language-subtags">
<t>
For each language in <xref target="ISO639-3" /> that was not already
represented by a language subtag in the Language Subtag Registry, a new
language subtag was added to the registry, using the
<xref target="ISO639-3" /> code element as the value for the Subtag field
and using each of the non-inverted <xref target="ISO639-3" /> names as a separate
Description field.  The <xref target="ISO639-3" /> reference name is
represented by the first Description field.
</t>
<t>
If the language was encompassed by one of the <xref target="ISO639-3" />
macrolanguages &lsquo;ar&rsquo; (Arabic), &lsquo;kok&rsquo; (Konkani),
&lsquo;ms&rsquo; (Malay), &lsquo;sw&rsquo; (Swahili), &lsquo;uz&rsquo;
(Uzbek), or &lsquo;zh&rsquo; (Chinese), as determined by
<xref target="iso-639-3-macrolanguages_20090120" />, an extended
language subtag was also added, with the primary language subtag of the
macrolanguage as the value for the Prefix field.  These macrolanguage
subtags were already present in the Language Subtag Registry and were
chosen because they were determined by the LTRU Working Group to have
been used to represent a single dominant language as well as the
macrolanguage as a whole, making the extended language mechanism
suitable for languages encompassed by the macrolanguage.
</t>
<t>
If the name of the language included the word &ldquo;Sign&rdquo;, an
extended language subtag was added, with the string &ldquo;sgn&rdquo;
as the value for the Prefix field.  This is a special case that treats
the existing primary language subtag for &ldquo;Sign languages&rdquo;
as if it were a macrolanguage encompassing all sign languages.
</t>
<t>
All extended language subtags were added with a Preferred-Value equal to
the corresponding primary language subtag.
</t>
<t>
If the language was encompassed by a macrolanguage, as determined by
<xref target="iso-639-3-macrolanguages_20090120" />, a Macrolanguage field
was added for the encompassed language, with a value equal to the subtag of
the macrolanguage.  (Note that &lsquo;sgn&rsquo; is defined as a
&ldquo;collection code&rdquo; by <xref target="ISO639-3" /> and hence is not
included in that standard; therefore, no Macrolanguage field was added for
sign language subtags.)
</t>
<t>
If the language was assigned a &ldquo;Scope&rdquo; value of &lsquo;M&rsquo;
(Macrolanguage) in <xref target="iso-639-3_20090210" />, a Scope value of
&ldquo;macrolanguage&rdquo; was added for the language.  Otherwise, if the
language was assigned a &ldquo;Scope&rdquo; value of &lsquo;S&rsquo;
(Special), a Scope value of &ldquo;special&rdquo; was added.  Most languages
in <xref target="ISO639-3" /> have scope &lsquo;I&rsquo; (Individual) and
thus were not assigned a Scope value in the registry.
</t>
<t>
For each language in <xref target="iso639-5.tab.txt" /> that was not
already represented by a language subtag in the Language Subtag
Registry, a new language subtag was added to the registry, using the
<xref target="ISO639-5" /> code element as the value for the Subtag
field and using the &ldquo;English name&rdquo; field as the Description field.
Each of these languages was assigned a Scope value of
&ldquo;collection&rdquo; in the registry.
</t>
<t>
All subtags were added to the registry maintaining alphabetical order within
each type of subtag: all 2-letter &ldquo;language&rdquo; subtags first, then
all 3-letter &ldquo;language&rdquo; subtags, and finally all
&ldquo;extlang&rdquo; subtags.  Some existing records were moved to ensure
this order.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Modified Language Subtags" anchor="modified-language-subtags">
<t>
For each language in <xref target="ISO639-3" /> that was already
represented by a language subtag in the Language Subtag Registry,
Description fields were added as necessary to reflect all non-inverted
names listed for that language in
<xref target="iso-639-3_Name_Index_20090210" />.  Any existing
Description fields that reflected inverted names or that
represented a strict subset of the information provided by the
<xref target="ISO639-3" /> name were deleted.  An example of the latter
was the name &ldquo;Ainu&rdquo; for the subtag &lsquo;ain&rsquo;, which
provided less information than the <xref target="ISO639-3" /> name
&ldquo;Ainu (Japan)&rdquo;.
</t>
<t>
The order of Description fields was adjusted to ensure that the
reference name from <xref target="ISO639-3" /> was listed first, followed
by other names from <xref target="ISO639-3" /> in the order presented by
that standard, followed by any other names already existing in the
registry.  In some cases, this resulted in a reordering of Description
fields for existing entries, even when no new values were added.
</t>
<t>
For each language that was encompassed by a macrolanguage in
<xref target="ISO639-3" />, a Macrolanguage field was added, with a
value equal to the subtag of the macrolanguage.
</t>
<t>
For each language in <xref target="iso639-5.tab.txt" /> that was already
represented in the Language Subtag Registry, the Description field was
adjusted as necessary to match the &ldquo;English name&rdquo; field in
<xref target="iso639-5.tab.txt" />.  Names in inverted form were
rearranged to remove the inversion.  Each of these languages was
assigned a Scope value of &ldquo;collection&rdquo;.  Existing language
subtags whose code elements were assigned prior to the publication of
<xref target="ISO639-3" /> or <xref target="ISO639-5" /> and that were
identified by the <xref target="ISO639-3" /> Registration Authority as
representing collections were also assigned a Scope value of
&ldquo;collection&rdquo;, even though they are not listed as such in
<xref target="iso639-5.tab.txt" />.
</t>
<t>
Note in particular that the change from <xref target="ISO639-2" /> names
such as &ldquo;Afro-Asiatic (Other)&rdquo; to <xref target="ISO639-5" />
names such as &ldquo;Afro-Asiatic languages&rdquo; implies a broadening
of scope for some of these subtags, designated &ldquo;remainder
groups&rdquo; in <xref target="ISO639-5" />.  While
<xref target="iso639-5.tab.txt" /> includes a field indicating which
code elements are designated as &ldquo;groups&rdquo; or &ldquo;remainder
groups&rdquo; in <xref target="ISO639-2" />,
<xref target="RFC5646" /> does not make this
distinction, and consequently this field was not used in updating the
Language Subtag Registry.
</t>
<t>
A Scope value of &ldquo;private-use&rdquo; was added for the unique record
with Subtag value &lsquo;qaa..qtz&rsquo;.  This record has a Description of
&ldquo;Private use&rdquo; (changed from &ldquo;PRIVATE USE&rdquo;) and
corresponds to a range of code elements that is reserved for private use
in <xref target="ISO639-2" />.  The Description fields for script and
region private-use subtags were also capitalized as &ldquo;Private
use&rdquo;.
</t>
</section>

<section title="New Region Subtags" anchor="new-region-subtags">
<t>
<xref target="RFC5646" /> expands the scope of
region subtags by adding subtags based on code elements defined as
&ldquo;exceptionally reserved&rdquo; in <xref target="ISO3166-1" />.
These code elements are reserved by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency
&ldquo;at the request of national ISO member bodies, governments and
international organizations&rdquo;.  At the time of IESG approval of
this memo, ISO 3166/MA had defined nine exceptionally reserved code
elements, all of which were added to the Language Subtag Registry
except for the following:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
&lsquo;FX&rsquo; (Metropolitan France) was already present in the
Language Subtag Registry because it was an assigned <xref target="ISO3166-1" />
code element from 1993 to 1997, but was deprecated with a
Preferred-Value of &ldquo;FR&rdquo;.
</t>
<t>
&lsquo;UK&rsquo; (United Kingdom) was not added because it is associated
with the same UN M.49 code (826) as the existing region subtag
&lsquo;GB&rsquo;.  <xref target="RFC5646" />, Section
3.4, item 15 (D) states that a new region subtag is not added to the
Language Subtag Registry if it carries the same meaning as an existing
region subtag.
</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Grandfathered and Redundant Tags" anchor="grandfathered">
<t>
As stated in <xref target="RFC5646" />,
&ldquo;grandfathered&rdquo; and &ldquo;redundant&rdquo; tags are
complete tags in the Language Subtag Registry that were registered under
<xref target="RFC1766" /> or <xref target="RFC3066" /> and remain valid.
Grandfathered tags cannot be generated from a valid combination of
subtags, while redundant tags can be.
</t>
<t>
Under certain conditions, registration of a subtag under
<xref target="RFC5646" /> may cause a grandfathered
tag to be reclassified as redundant.  It may also enable the creation of
a generative tag with the same meaning as a grandfathered or redundant
tag; in that case, the grandfathered or redundant tag is marked as
Deprecated, and the generative tag (including the new subtag) becomes
its Preferred-Value.
</t>
<t>
As a result of adding the new subtags in this update, each of the following
grandfathered tags became composable, were reclassified as redundant,
and were deprecated with the indicated generative tag serving as the
Preferred-Value:
<list style="empty">
	<t>zh-cmn (Preferred-Value: cmn)</t>
	<t>zh-cmn-Hans (Preferred-Value: cmn-Hans)</t>
	<t>zh-cmn-Hant (Preferred-Value: cmn-Hant)</t>
	<t>zh-gan (Preferred-Value: gan)</t>
	<t>zh-wuu (Preferred-Value: wuu)</t>
	<t>zh-yue (Preferred-Value: yue)</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
The following grandfathered tags were deprecated, with the indicated
generative tag serving as the Preferred-Value:
<list style="empty">
	<t>i-ami (Preferred-Value: ami)</t>
	<t>i-bnn (Preferred-Value: bnn)</t>
	<t>i-pwn (Preferred-Value: pwn)</t>
	<t>i-tao (Preferred-Value: tao)</t>
	<t>i-tay (Preferred-Value: tay)</t>
	<t>i-tsu (Preferred-Value: tsu)</t>
	<t>zh-hakka (Preferred-Value: hak)</t>
	<t>zh-min (no Preferred-Value; see below)</t>
	<t>zh-min-nan (Preferred-Value: nan)</t>
	<t>zh-xiang (Preferred-Value: hns)</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
The tag &ldquo;zh-min&rdquo;, originally registered under
<xref target="RFC1766" />, is a special case: it represents a small
class of Chinese languages, but is not a true macrolanguage.  The string
&ldquo;min&rdquo; could not ever be used to tag these languages since
the <xref target="ISO639-3" /> code element &lsquo;min&rsquo; is
assigned to an individual language (Minangkabau) that is not related to
Chinese (&lsquo;zh&rsquo;).  Because it is not believed to represent a
useful linguistic entity for tagging purposes, it was deprecated without
a Preferred-Value.
</t>
<t>
The following grandfathered and redundant sign language tags were
deprecated, with the indicated generative tag serving as the
Preferred-Value:
<list style="empty">
	<t>sgn-BE-FR (Preferred-Value: sfb)</t>
	<t>sgn-BE-NL (Preferred-Value: vgt)</t>
	<t>sgn-BR (Preferred-Value: bzs)</t>
	<t>sgn-CH-DE (Preferred-Value: sgg)</t>
	<t>sgn-CO (Preferred-Value: csn)</t>
	<t>sgn-DE (Preferred-Value: gsg)</t>
	<t>sgn-DK (Preferred-Value: dsl)</t>
	<t>sgn-ES (Preferred-Value: ssp)</t>
	<t>sgn-FR (Preferred-Value: fsl)</t>
	<t>sgn-GB (Preferred-Value: bfi)</t>
	<t>sgn-GR (Preferred-Value: gss)</t>
	<t>sgn-IE (Preferred-Value: isg)</t>
	<t>sgn-IT (Preferred-Value: ise)</t>
	<t>sgn-JP (Preferred-Value: jsl)</t>
	<t>sgn-MX (Preferred-Value: mfs)</t>
	<t>sgn-NI (Preferred-Value: ncs)</t>
	<t>sgn-NL (Preferred-Value: dse)</t>
	<t>sgn-NO (Preferred-Value: nsl)</t>
	<t>sgn-PT (Preferred-Value: psr)</t>
	<t>sgn-SE (Preferred-Value: swl)</t>
	<t>sgn-US (Preferred-Value: ase)</t>
	<t>sgn-ZA (Preferred-Value: sfs)</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
No change was made to the Description field(s) for any of the
grandfathered or redundant tags.  For example, the redundant tag
&ldquo;sgn-US&rdquo; continues to carry the Description &ldquo;American
Sign Language&rdquo;.  The sign language tags registered prior to
<xref target="RFC4646" /> remain an exception to the general principle
that the meaning of a non-grandfathered tag can be derived from its
component subtags.
</t>
<t>
In previous versions of the registry, grandfathered tags that had been
deprecated as a result of adding an ISO 639-based language subtag
included a Comments field, with a value of the form &ldquo;replaced by
ISO code xxx&rdquo;, where &lsquo;xxx&rsquo; represented the new
language subtag.  These comments duplicated the information contained
within the Preferred-Value field and were deleted as part of this
update.  No changes were made to other Comments fields.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Preferred-Value Changes" anchor="preferred-value">
<t>
<xref target="RFC5646" />, Section 3.1.7 provides for
the value of Preferred-Value fields to be updated as necessary to
reflect changes in one of the source standards.  Accordingly, the
Preferred-Value fields for the following deprecated tags were changed:
<list style="empty">
	<t>i-hak (changed from zh-hakka to hak)</t>
	<t>zh-guoyu (changed from zh-cmn to cmn)</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
This makes it unnecessary for consumers of the Language Subtag Registry
to follow a &ldquo;chain&rdquo; of Preferred-Values in order to arrive
at a non-deprecated subtag.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Additional Changes" anchor="additional-changes">
<t>
For consistency with the handling of alternative names in language
subtags, Description fields for script subtags taken from
<xref target="ISO15924" /> that represent alternative names were
converted to multiple Description fields.  For example, the Description
&ldquo;Han (Hanzi, Kanji, Hanja)&rdquo; was converted to four separate
Description fields.  Some Description fields for script subtags contained
parenthetical material that was explanatory, rather than identifying
alternative names; these fields were not altered.
</t>
<t>
This situation does not apply to region subtags taken from
<xref target="ISO3166-1" /> and <xref target="UN_M.49" /> because those
standards do not provide freely available alternative names for code
elements.
</t>
<t>
Description fields in inverted form for script and region subtags were
rearranged to remove the inversion, for consistency with the handling of
language subtags in Sections <xref format="counter" target="new-language-subtags" /> and
<xref format="counter" target="modified-language-subtags" />.  For example, the
Description field &ldquo;Korea, Republic of&rdquo; was changed to
&ldquo;Republic of Korea&rdquo;.
</t>
<t>
The capitalization of the Subtag fields for certain grandfathered and
redundant tags (sgn-BE-fr, sgn-BE-nl, sgn-CH-de, and yi-latn) was modified
to conform with the capitalization conventions described in
<xref target="RFC5646" />, Section 2.1.1.  This has
no effect on the validity or meaning of these tags.
</t>
<t>
The Description field for subtag &lsquo;sgn&rsquo; was capitalized as
&ldquo;Sign languages&rdquo; to match the capitalization used for other
languages in <xref target="ISO639-5" />, even though this capitalization
does not exactly match that used for code element &lsquo;sgn&rsquo; in any
of the ISO 639 parts.
</t>
<t>
The Deprecated field for the region subtag TP was modified from
2002-11-15 to 2002-05-20, to correct a clerical error.  The corrected
date reflects the actual date the code element TP was withdrawn in
<xref target="ISO3166-1" />.
</t>
<t>
The order of fields within records in the registry was adjusted as necessary
to match the order in which these fields are described in
<xref target="RFC5646" />, Section 3.1.2.  This ordering
is not required by <xref target="RFC5646" /> and may not
necessarily be reflected in future additions or modifications to the
registry.
