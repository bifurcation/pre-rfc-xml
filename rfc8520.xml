    <abstract>
<t>This memo specifies a component-based architecture for Manufacturer
Usage Descriptions (MUDs). The goal of MUD is to provide a means for
end devices to signal to the network what sort of access and network
functionality they require to properly function.  The initial focus is
on access control.  Later work can delve into other aspects.</t>

<t>This memo specifies two YANG modules, IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP options, a
Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) TLV, a URL, an X.509 certificate extension, and a means to sign
and verify the descriptions.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>The Internet has largely been constructed for general purpose
computers, those devices that may be used for a purpose that is
specified by those who own the device.  In <xref target="RFC1984"/>, it was presumed that an
end device would be most capable of protecting itself.  This made
sense when the typical device was a workstation or a mainframe, and it
continues to make sense for general purpose computing devices today,
including laptops, smart phones, and tablets.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC7452"/> discusses design patterns for, and poses questions about,
smart objects.  Let us then posit a group of objects that are
specifically not intended to be used for general purpose computing
tasks.  These devices, which this memo refers to as Things, have a
specific purpose.  By definition, therefore, all other uses are not
intended.  If a small number of communication patterns follows from
those small number of uses, the combination of these two statements
can be restated as a Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) that can be
applied at various points within a network.  MUD primarily addresses
threats to the device rather than the device as a threat.  In some
circumstances, however, MUD may offer some protection in the latter
case, depending on how the MUD URL is communicated and how devices and
their communications are authenticated.</t>

<t>We use the notion of "manufacturer" loosely in this context to refer
to the entity or organization that will state how a device is intended
to be used.  For example, in the context of a light bulb, this might
indeed be the light bulb manufacturer.  In the context of a smarter
device that has a built in Linux stack, it might be an integrator of
that device.  The key points are that the device itself is assumed to
serve a limited purpose, and that there exists an organization in
the supply chain of that device that will take responsibility for
informing the network about that purpose.</t>

<t>The intent of MUD is to provide the following:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Substantially reduce the threat surface on a device to those
communications intended by the manufacturer.</t>
  <t>Provide a means to scale network policies to the ever-increasing
number of types of devices in the network.</t>
  <t>Provide a means to address at least some vulnerabilities in a way
that is faster than the time it might take to update systems.  This will be
particularly true for systems that are no longer supported.</t>
  <t>Keep the cost of implementation of such a system to the bare minimum.</t>
  <t>Provide a means of extensibility for manufacturers to express other
device capabilities or requirements.</t>
</list></t>

<t>MUD consists of three architectural building blocks:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A URL that can be used to locate a description;</t>
  <t>The description itself, including how it is interpreted; and</t>
  <t>A means for local network management systems to retrieve the description.</t>
</list></t>

<t>MUD is most effective when the network is able to identify in some way
the remote endpoints that Things will talk to.</t>

<t>In this specification, we describe each of these building blocks and how
they are intended to be used together.  However, they may also be used
separately, independent of this specification, by local deployments
for their own purposes.</t>

<section anchor="what-mud-doesnt-do" title="What MUD Doesn't Do">
<t>MUD is not intended to address network authorization of general
purpose computers, as their manufacturers cannot envision a specific
communication pattern to describe.  In addition, even those devices
that have a single or small number of uses might have very broad
communication patterns.  MUD on its own is not for them either.</t>

<t>Although MUD can provide network administrators with some additional
protection when device vulnerabilities exist, it will never replace the
need for manufacturers to patch vulnerabilities.</t>

<t>Finally, no matter what the manufacturer specifies in a MUD file,
these are not directives, but suggestions.  How they are instantiated
locally will depend on many factors and will be ultimately up to the
local network administrator, who must decide what is appropriate in
a given circumstances.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="a-simple-example" title="A Simple Example">

<t>A light bulb is intended to light a room.  It may be remotely
controlled through the network, and it may make use of a rendezvous
service (which could be accessed by an application on a smart phone).  What we can
say about that light bulb, then, is that all other network access is
unwanted.  It will not contact a news service, nor speak to the
refrigerator, and it has no need of a printer or other devices.  It
has no social networking friends.  
   Therefore, applying an access list 
   to it that states it will only connect to the single rendezvous
   service will not impede performing its function; at the same time,
   this will allow the network to provide the light bulb and other 
   devices an additional layer of protection.</t>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='MUD:'>

  <t hangText='MUD file server:'>

  the system that requests and receives the MUD file from the MUD

  the entity that configures the Thing to emit the MUD URL and the one

might not always be the entity that constructs a Thing.  It could,
for instance, be a systems integrator, or even a component provider.</t>
</list></t>

<t>  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
    described in BCP&nbsp;14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> 
    when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="determining-intended-use" title="Determining Intended Use">
<t>The notion of intended use is in itself not new.  Network
administrators apply access lists every day to allow for only such
use.  This notion of white listing was well described by Chapman and
Zwicky in <xref target="FW95"/>.  Profiling systems that make use of heuristics
to identify types of systems have existed for years as well.</t>

<t>A Thing could just as easily tell the network what sort of access it
requires without going into what sort of system it is.  This would, in
effect, be the converse of <xref target="RFC7488"/>.  In seeking a general
solution, however, we assume that a device will implement
functionality necessary to fulfill its limited purpose.  This is basic
economic constraint.  Unless the network would refuse access to such a
device, its developers would have no reason to provide the network any
information.  To date, such an assertion has held true.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="finding-a-policy-the-mud-url" title="Finding a Policy: The MUD URL">

<t>Our work begins with the device emitting a Universal
Resource Locator (URL) <xref target="RFC3986"/>.  This URL serves both to
classify the device type and to provide a means to locate a policy
file.</t>

<t>MUD URLs MUST use the "https" scheme <xref target="RFC7230"/>.</t>

<t>In this memo, three means are defined to emit the MUD URL, as follows:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">

  <t>A DHCP option <xref target="RFC2131"/> <xref target="RFC8415"/> that the DHCP client uses to
inform the DHCP server.  The DHCP server may take further actions,
such as acting as the MUD manager or passing the MUD URL along
to the MUD manager.</t>

  <t>An X.509 constraint.  The IEEE has developed IEEE 802.1AR <xref target="IEEE8021AR"/> to
provide a certificate-based approach to communicate device characteristics,
which itself relies on <xref target="RFC5280"/>.  The MUD URL extension is
non-critical, as required by IEEE 802.1AR. Various means may be used
to communicate that certificate, including the Tunnel Extensible
Authentication Protocol (TEAP) <xref target="RFC7170"/>.</t>

  <t>Finally, a Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) frame is defined <xref target="IEEE8021AB"/>.</t>
</list></t>

<t>It is possible that there may be other means for a MUD URL to be
learned by a network.  For instance, some devices may already be
fielded or have very limited ability to communicate a MUD URL, and yet
they can be identified through some means, such as a serial number or a
public key.  In these cases, manufacturers may be able to map those
identifiers to particular MUD URLs (or even the files themselves).
Similarly, there may be alternative resolution mechanisms available
for situations where Internet connectivity is limited or does not
exist.  Such mechanisms are not described in this memo, but they are
possible.  Implementors are encouraged to allow for the
flexibility of how MUD URLs may be learned.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="processing-of-the-mud-url" title="Processing of the MUD URL">

<t>MUD managers that are able to do so SHOULD retrieve MUD URLs and
signature files as per <xref target="RFC7230"/>, using the GET method <xref target="RFC7231"/>.
They MUST validate the certificate using the rules in <xref target="RFC2818"/>,
Section 3.1.</t>

<t>Requests for MUD URLs SHOULD include an "Accept" header field (<xref target="RFC7231"/>,
Section 5.3.2) containing "application/mud+json", an "Accept-Language"
header field (<xref target="RFC7231"/>, Section 5.3.5), and a "User-Agent" header
field (<xref target="RFC7231"/>, Section 5.5.3).</t>

<t>MUD managers SHOULD automatically process 3xx response status codes.</t>

<t>If a MUD manager is not able to fetch a MUD URL, other means MAY
be used to import MUD files and associated signature files.  So long
as the signature of the file can be validated, the file can be used.
In such environments, controllers SHOULD warn administrators when
cache-validity expiry is approaching so that they may check for new
files.</t>

<t>It may not be possible for a MUD manager to retrieve a MUD file at any
given time.  Should a MUD manager fail to retrieve a MUD file, it
SHOULD consider the existing one safe to use, at least for a time.
After some period, it SHOULD log that it has been unable to retrieve
the file.  There may be very good reasons for such failures, including
the possibility that the MUD manager is in an offline environment,
the local Internet connection has failed, or the remote Internet
connection has failed.  It is also possible that an attacker is
attempting to interfere with the deployment of a device.  How to handle such circumstances is a local decision.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="types-of-policies" title="Types of Policies">

<t>When the MUD URL is resolved, the MUD manager retrieves a file that
describes what sort of communications a device is designed to have.
The manufacturer may specify either specific hosts for cloud-based
services or certain classes for access within an operational network.
An example of a class might be "devices of a specified manufacturer
type", where the manufacturer type itself is indicated simply by the
authority component (e.g., the domain name) of the MUD URL.  Another
example might be to allow or disallow local access.  Just like other
policies, these may be combined.  For example:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Allow access to devices of the same manufacturer</t>
  <t>Allow access to and from controllers via the Constrained Application
Protocol (COAP) <xref target="RFC7252"/></t>
  <t>Allow access to local DNS/NTP</t>
  <t>Deny all other access</t>
</list></t>

<t>A printer might have a description that states:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Allow access for port IPP or port LPD</t>
  <t>Allow local access for port HTTP</t>
  <t>Deny all other access</t>
</list></t>

<t>In this way, anyone can print to the printer, but local access would
be required for the management interface.</t>

<t>The files that are retrieved are intended to be closely aligned to
existing network architectures so that they are easy to deploy.  We
make use of YANG <xref target="RFC7950"/> because it provides accurate and adequate
models for use by network devices.  JSON <xref target="RFC8259"/> is used as a serialization
format for compactness and readability, relative to XML.  Other formats may
be chosen with later versions of MUD.</t>

<t>While the policy examples given here focus on access control, this is
not intended to be the sole focus.  By structuring the model described
in this document with clear extension points, other
descriptions could be included.  One that often comes to mind is
quality of service.</t>

<t>The YANG modules specified here are extensions of
<xref target="RFC8519"/>.  The extensions to this model allow for
a manufacturer to express classes of systems that a manufacturer would
find necessary for the proper function of the device.  Two modules are
specified. The first module specifies a means for domain names to be
used in Access Control Lists (ACLs) so that devices that have their controllers in the cloud
may be appropriately authorized with domain names, where the mapping
of those names to addresses may rapidly change.</t>

<t>The other module abstracts away IP addresses into certain classes that
are instantiated into actual IP addresses through local processing.
Through these classes, manufacturers can specify how the device is
designed to communicate, so that network elements can be configured by
local systems that have local topological knowledge.  That is, the
deployment populates the classes that the manufacturer specifies.  The
abstractions below map to zero or more hosts, as follows:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='Manufacturer:'>
  A device made by a particular manufacturer, as identified by the authority
component of its MUD URL.</t>
  <t hangText='same-manufacturer:'>
  Devices that have the same authority component of their MUD URL.</t>
  <t hangText='controller:'>
  Devices that the local network administrator admits to the particular class.</t>
  <t hangText='my-controller:'>
  Devices intended to serve as controllers for the MUD URL that the Thing emitted.</t>
  <t hangText='local:'>
  The class of IP addresses that are scoped within some administrative boundary.
By default, it is suggested that this be the local subnet.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The "manufacturer" classes can be easily specified by the
manufacturer, whereas controller classes are initially envisioned to
be specified by the administrator.</t>

<t>Because manufacturers do not know who will be using their devices, it
is important for functionality referenced in usage descriptions to be
relatively ubiquitous and mature.  For these reasons, the YANG-based
configuration in a MUD file is limited to the modules either specified
or referenced in this document, or specified in documented
extensions.</t>

architecture.  This leads us to ASCII art.</t>

]]></artwork></figure>

<t>In the above diagram, the switch or router collects MUD URLs and
forwards them to the MUD manager (a network management system) for
processing.  This happens in different ways, depending on how the URL
is communicated.  For instance, in the case of DHCP, the DHCP server
might receive the URL and then process it.  In the case of IEEE 802.1X
<xref target="IEEE8021X"/>, the switch would carry the URL via a certificate to the
authentication server via the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) over Radius <xref target="RFC3748"/>, which would then
process it.  One method to do this is TEAP, as described in <xref target="RFC7170"/>.
The certificate extension is described below.</t>

<t>The information returned by the MUD file server is valid for as long
as the Thing is connected.  There is no expiry.  However, if the MUD
manager has detected that the MUD file for a Thing has changed, it
SHOULD update the policy expeditiously, taking into account whatever
approval flow is required in a deployment.  In this way, new
recommendations from the manufacturer can be processed in a timely
fashion.</t>

<t>The information returned by the MUD file server (a web server) is
valid for the duration of the Thing's connection, or as specified in
the description.  Thus, if the Thing is disconnected, any associated
configuration in the switch can be removed.  Similarly, from time to
time the description may be refreshed, based on new capabilities or
communication patterns or vulnerabilities.</t>

<t>The web server is typically run by or on behalf of the manufacturer.
Its domain name is that of the authority found in the MUD URL.  For
legacy cases where Things cannot emit a URL, if the switch is able to
determine the appropriate URL, it may proxy it.  In a trivial case,
it may hardcode a MUD URL on a switch port or a map from some
available identifier such as an L2 address or certificate hash to a
MUD URL.</t>

<t>The role of the MUD manager in this environment is to do the
following:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>receive MUD URLs,</t>
  <t>fetch MUD files,</t>
  <t>translate abstractions in the MUD files to specific network element
configuration,</t>
  <t>maintain and update any required mappings of the abstractions, and</t>
  <t>update network elements with appropriate configuration.</t>
</list></t>

<t>A MUD manager may be a component of an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) system or a network management system. Communication within those systems and from those systems to
network elements is beyond the scope of this memo.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="order-of-operations" title="Order of Operations">
<t>As mentioned above, MUD contains architectural building blocks, so
the order of operation may vary.  However, here is one clear intended
example:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Thing emits a URL.</t>

  <t>That URL is forwarded to a MUD manager by the nearest switch
(how this happens depends on the way in which the MUD URL is emitted).</t>

  <t>The MUD manager retrieves the MUD file and signature from the MUD file
server, assuming it doesn't already have copies.  After validating
the signature, it may test the
URL against a web or domain reputation service, and it may test any hosts within
the file against those reputation services, as it deems fit.</t>

  <t>The MUD manager may query the administrator for permission to
add the Thing and associated policy.  If the Thing is known or
the Thing type is known, it may skip this step.</t>

  <t>The MUD manager instantiates local configuration based on
the abstractions defined in this document.</t>

  <t>The MUD manager configures the switch nearest the Thing.
Other systems may be configured as well.</t>

  <t>When the Thing disconnects, policy is removed.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="the-mud-model-and-semantic-meaning" title="The MUD Model and Semantic Meaning">

<t>A MUD file consists of a YANG model instance that has been serialized in JSON
<xref target="RFC7951"/>.  For purposes of MUD, the nodes that can be modified are
access lists as augmented by this model.  The MUD file is limited to
the serialization of only the following YANG schema:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>ietf-access-control-list <xref target="RFC8519"/></t>
  <t>ietf-mud (RFC 8520)</t>
  <t>ietf-acldns (RFC 8520)</t>
</list></t>

<t>Extensions may be used to add additional schema.  This is described
further on.</t>

<t>To provide the widest possible deployment, publishers of MUD files
SHOULD make use of the abstractions in this memo and avoid the use of
IP addresses.  A MUD manager SHOULD NOT automatically implement any
MUD file that contains IP addresses, especially those that might have
local significance.  The addressing of one side of an access list is
implicit, based on whether it is applied as to-device-policy or
from&nbhy;device&nbhy;policy.</t>

<t>With the exceptions of the "name" of the ACL, "type", "name" of the Access Control Entry (ACE), and TCP
and UDP source and destination port information, publishers of MUD
files SHOULD limit the use of ACL model leaf nodes expressed to those
found in this specification.  Absent any extensions, MUD files are
assumed to implement only the following ACL model features:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>match-on-ipv4, match-on-ipv6, match-on-tcp,
match-on-udp, match-on-icmp</t>
</list></t>

<t>Furthermore, only "accept" or "drop" actions SHOULD be included.  A
MUD manager MAY choose to interpret "reject" as "drop".  A MUD
manager SHOULD ignore all other actions.  This is because
manufacturers do not have sufficient context within a local deployment
to know whether reject is appropriate.  That is a decision that should
be left to a network administrator.</t>

<t>Given that MUD does not deal with interfaces, the support of the
"ietf-interfaces" module <xref target="RFC8343"/> is not required. Specifically,
the support of interface-related features and branches (e.g.,
interface-attachment and interface-stats) of the ACL YANG module is
not required.</t>

<t>In fact, MUD managers MAY ignore any particular component of a
description or MAY ignore the description in its entirety, and they SHOULD
carefully inspect all MUD descriptions.  Publishers of MUD files MUST
NOT include other nodes except as described in <xref target="extensions"/>.  See
that section for more information.</t>

<section anchor="the-ietf-mud-yang-module" title="The IETF-MUD YANG Module">

<t>This module is structured into three parts:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The first component, the "mud" container, holds information that is
relevant to retrieval and validity of the MUD file itself, as well
as policy intended to and from the Thing.</t>

  <t>The second component augments the matching container of the ACL
model to add several nodes that are relevant to the MUD URL, or they are
otherwise abstracted for use within a local environment.</t>

  <t>The third component  augments the tcp-acl container of the ACL
model to add the ability to match on the direction of initiation of a
TCP connection.</t>
</list></t>

<t>A valid MUD file will contain two root objects: a "mud" container and
an "acls" container.  Extensions may add additional root
objects as required.  As a reminder, when parsing acls,
elements within a "match" block are logically ANDed.  In general, a
single abstraction in a match statement should be used.  For instance,
it makes little sense to match both "my-controller" and "controller"
with an argument, since they are highly unlikely to be the same value.</t>

<t>A simplified graphical representation of the data models is used in
this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is
explained in <xref target="RFC8340"/>.</t>

pattern of a Thing, and that includes indicating what is to be
permitted or denied in either direction of communication.  Hence, each

association with a particular Thing.  They contain references to
specific access lists.</t>

<t>This uint8 is the period of time in hours that a network management

NOT be more than 168 for any Thing that is supported.  This period
SHOULD be no shorter than any period determined through HTTP caching
directives (e.g., "cache-control" or "Expires").  N.B., the expiring of
this timer does not require the MUD manager to discard the MUD
file, nor terminate access to a Thing.  See <xref target="secon"/> for more
information.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="is-supported" title="is-supported">
<t>This boolean is an indication from the manufacturer to the network
administrator as to whether or not the Thing is supported.  In this
context, a Thing is said to not be supported if the manufacturer
intends never to issue a firmware or software update to the Thing or
never to update the MUD file.  A MUD manager MAY still periodically check
for updates.</t>

the MUD URL cannot be.  This would be the case, for instance, with
MUD URLs that are contained in 802.1AR certificates.</t>

<t>This optional leaf-list names MUD extensions that are used in the MUD

<section anchor="augmentation-to-the-acl-model" title="Augmentation to the ACL Model">

<t>Note that in this section, when we use the term "match", we are
referring to the ACL model "matches" node.</t>

<section anchor="manufacturer" title="manufacturer">
<t>This node consists of a hostname that would be matched against the
authority component of another Thing's MUD URL.  In its simplest form,
"manufacturer" and "same-manufacturer" may be implemented as
access lists. In more complex forms, additional network capabilities
may be used.  For example, if one saw the line
 "manufacturer" : "flobbidy.example.com", then all Things that
registered with a MUD URL that contained flobbity.example.com in its
authority section would match.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="same-manufacturer" title="same-manufacturer">
<t>This null-valued node is an equivalent for when the manufacturer
element is used to indicate that the authority found in another
Thing's MUD URL matches that of the authority found in this Thing's
MUD URL.  For example, if the Thing's MUD URL were
"https://b1.example.com/ThingV1", then all devices
that had a MUD URL with an authority section of b1.example.com would
match.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="documentation" title="documentation">
<t>This URI consists of a URL that points to documentation relating to
the device and the MUD file.  This can prove particularly useful when
the "controller" class is used, so that its use can be explained.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="model" title="model">
<t>This string matches the entire MUD URL, thus covering the model that
is unique within the context of the authority.  It may contain not
only model information, but versioning information as well, and any
other information that the manufacturer wishes to add.  The intended
use is for devices of this precise class to match, to permit or
deny communication between one another.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="local-networks" title="local-networks">
<t>This null-valued node expands to include local networks.  Its
default expansion is that packets must not traverse toward a default
route that is received from the router.  However, administrators may
expand the expression as is appropriate in their deployments.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="controller" title="controller">
<t>This URI specifies a value that a controller will register with the
MUD manager.  The node then is expanded to the set
of hosts that are so registered.  This node may also be a URN.  In
this case, the URN describes a well-known service, such as DNS or
NTP, that has been standardized.  Both of those URNs may be found in
<xref target="urns"/>.</t>

<t>When "my-controller" is used, it is possible that the administrator
will be prompted to populate that class for each and every model.  Use
of "controller" with a named class allows the user to populate that
class only once for many different models that a manufacturer may
produce.</t>

<t>Controller URIs MAY take the form of a URL (e.g., "http[s]://").
However, MUD managers MUST NOT resolve and retrieve such files, and
it is RECOMMENDED that there be no such file at this time, as their
form and function may be defined at a point in the future.  For now,
URLs should serve simply as class names and may be populated by the
local deployment administrator.</t>

<t>Great care should be taken by MUD managers when invoking the
controller class in the form of URLs.  For one thing, it requires some
understanding by the administrator as to when it is appropriate.
Pre-registration in such classes by controllers with the MUD server is
encouraged.  The mechanism to do that is beyond the scope of this
work.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="my-controller" title="my-controller">
<t>This null-valued node signals to the MUD manager to use whatever
mapping it has for this MUD URL to a particular group of hosts.  This may
require prompting the administrator for class members.  Future work
should seek to automate membership management.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="direction-initiated" title="direction-initiated">
<t>This MUST only be applied to TCP.  This matches the direction in which
a TCP connection is initiated.  When the direction initiated is
"from-device", packets that are transmitted in the direction of a
Thing MUST be dropped unless the Thing has first initiated a TCP
connection.  By way of example, this node may be implemented in its
simplest form by looking at naked SYN bits, but it may also be
implemented through more stateful mechanisms.</t>

<t>When applied, this matches packets when the flow was initiated in the
corresponding direction.  <xref target="RFC6092"/> specifies IPv6 guidance best
practices.  While that document is scoped specifically to IPv6, its
contents are applicable for IPv4 as well.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="processing-of-the-mud-file" title="Processing of the MUD File">
<t>To keep things relatively simple in addition to whatever definitions
exist, we also apply two additional default behaviors:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Anything not explicitly permitted is denied.</t>
  <t>Local DNS and NTP are, by default, permitted to and from the
Thing.</t>
</list></t>

<t>An explicit description of the defaults can be found in <xref target="defaults"/>.
These are applied AFTER all other explicit rules.  Thus, a default
behavior can be changed with a "drop" action.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="mudurl" title="What Does a MUD URL Look Like?">

<t>MUD URLs are required to use the "https" scheme, in order to establish the
MUD file server's identity and assure integrity of the MUD file.</t>

<t>Any "https://" URL can be a MUD URL. For example:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  https://things.example.org/product_abc123/v5
  https://www.example.net/mudfiles/temperature_sensor/
  https://example.com/lightbulbs/colour/v1
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>A manufacturer may construct a MUD URL in any way, so long as it makes
use of the "https" scheme.</t>

<section anchor="the-domain-name-extension-to-the-acl-model" title="The Domain Name Extension to the ACL Model">

<t>This module specifies an extension to the IETF-ACL model such that domain
names may be referenced by augmenting the "matches" node.
Different implementations may deploy differing methods to maintain the
mapping between the IP address and domain name, if indeed any are needed.
However, the intent is that resources that are referred to using a
name should be authorized (or not) within an access list.</t>

<t>The structure of the change is as follows:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
module: ietf-acldns
  augment /acl:acls/acl:acl/acl:aces/acl:ace/
    acl:matches/acl:l3/acl:ipv4/acl:ipv4:
    +--rw src-dnsname?   inet:host
    +--rw dst-dnsname?   inet:host
  augment /acl:acls/acl:acl/acl:aces/acl:ace/
    acl:matches/acl:l3/acl:ipv6/acl:ipv6:
    +--rw src-dnsname?   inet:host
    +--rw dst-dnsname?   inet:host
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The choice of these particular points in the access control list model is
based on the assumption that we are in some way referring to
IP-related resources, as that is what the DNS returns.  A domain name
in our context is defined in <xref target="RFC6991"/>. The augmentations are
replicated across IPv4 and IPv6 to allow MUD file authors the ability
to control the IP version that the Thing may utilize.</t>

<t>The following nodes are defined.</t>

<section anchor="src-dnsname" title="src-dnsname">
<t>The argument corresponds to a domain name of a source as specified by
inet:host.  A number of means may be used to resolve hosts.  What is
important is that such resolutions be consistent with ACLs that are required by
Things to properly operate.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="dst-dnsname" title="dst-dnsname">
<t>The argument corresponds to a domain name of a destination as
specified by inet:host.  See the previous section (<xref target="src-dnsname"/>) relating to
resolution.</t>

<t>Note that when using either of these with a MUD file, because access is
associated with a particular Thing, MUD files MUST NOT contain either
a src-dnsname in an ACL associated with from-device-policy or
a dst-dnsname associated with to-device-policy.</t>

<t>In this example, two policies are declared: one from the Thing and
the other to the Thing.  Each policy names an access list that
applies to the Thing and one that applies from the Thing.  Within each access
list, access is permitted to packets flowing to or from the Thing
that can be mapped to the domain name of "service.bms.example.com".
For each access list, the enforcement point should expect that the
Thing initiated the connection.</t>

<t>The intent of this option is to provide both a new Thing classifier

<section anchor="client-behavior" title="Client Behavior">
<t>A DHCPv4 client MAY emit a DHCPv4 option, and a DHCPv6 client MAY emit
a DHCPv6 option.  These options are singletons, as specified in
<xref target="RFC7227"/>.  Because clients are intended to have at most one MUD URL
associated with them, they may emit at most one MUD URL option via
DHCPv4 and one MUD URL option via DHCPv6. In the case where both v4
and v6 DHCP options are emitted, the same URL MUST be used.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="server-behavior" title="Server Behavior">

<t>A DHCP server may ignore these options or take action based on receipt
of these options.  When a server consumes this option, it will either
forward the URL and relevant client information (such as the gateway
address or giaddr and requested IP address, and lease length) to a
network management system or retrieve the usage description
itself by resolving the URL.</t>

<t>DHCP servers may implement MUD functionality themselves or they may
pass along appropriate information to a network management system or
MUD manager.  A DHCP server that does process the MUD URL MUST adhere
to the process specified in <xref target="RFC2818"/> and <xref target="RFC5280"/> to validate
the TLS certificate of the web server hosting the MUD file.  Those
servers will retrieve the file, process it, and create and install the
necessary configuration on the relevant network element.  Servers
SHOULD monitor the gateway for state changes on a given interface.  A
DHCP server that does not provide MUD functionality and has forwarded
a MUD URL to a MUD manager MUST notify the MUD manager
of any corresponding change to the DHCP state of the client
(such as expiration or explicit release of a network address lease).</t>

<t>Should the DHCP server fail, in the case when it implements the MUD
manager functionality, any backup mechanisms SHOULD include the MUD
state, and the server SHOULD resolve the status of clients upon its
restart, similar to what it would do absent MUD manager
functionality.  In the case where the DHCP server forwards information
to the MUD manager, the MUD manager will either make use of
redundant DHCP servers for information or clear state based
on other network information, such as monitoring port status on a
switch via SNMP, Radius accounting, or similar mechanisms.</t>

<section anchor="lldp" title="The Manufacturer Usage Description LLDP Extension">

<t>The IEEE802.1AB Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) is a
one-hop, vendor-neutral link-layer protocol used by end host network
Things for advertising their identity, capabilities, and neighbors on
an IEEE 802 local area network. Its Type-Length-Value (TLV) design
allows for "vendor-specific" extensions to be defined. IANA has a
registered IEEE 802 organizationally unique identifier (OUI) defined
as documented in <xref target="RFC7042"/>. The MUD LLDP extension uses a subtype
defined in this document to carry the MUD URL.</t>

<t>The LLDP vendor-specific frame has the following format:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
+--------+--------+----------+---------+--------------
|TLV Type|  len   |   OUI    |subtype  | MUDString

+--------+--------+----------+---------+--------------
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>where:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">

<t>The intent of this extension is to provide both a new Thing

<t>Hosts, routers, or other network elements that implement this option

may transmit at most one MUD URL value.</t>

<t>Hosts, routers, or other network elements that implement this option may
ignore these options or take action based on receipt of these options.
For example, they may fill in information in the respective extensions
of the LLDP Management Information Base (MIB). LLDP operates in a
one-way direction. Link Layer Discovery Protocol Data Units (LLDPDUs) are not exchanged as information requests
by one Thing and responses sent by another Thing. The other Things do
not acknowledge LLDP information received from a Thing.  No specific
network behavior is guaranteed.  When a Thing consumes this extension,
it may either forward the URL and relevant remote Thing information to
a MUD manager or retrieve the usage description by
resolving the URL in accordance with normal HTTP semantics.</t>

<section anchor="creating-and-processing-of-signed-mud-files" title="The Creating and Processing of Signed MUD Files">

<t>Because MUD files contain information that may be used to configure
network access lists, they are sensitive.  To ensure that they have
not been tampered with, it is important that they be signed.  We make
use of DER-encoded Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) <xref target="RFC5652"/> for
this purpose.</t>

<section anchor="creating-a-mud-file-signature" title="Creating a MUD File Signature">
<t>A MUD file MUST be signed using CMS as an opaque binary object.  In
order to make successful verification more likely, intermediate
certificates SHOULD be included.  The signature is stored at the
location specified in the MUD file.  Signatures are
transferred using content-type "application/pkcs7-signature".</t>

<t>For example:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
% openssl cms -sign -signer mancertfile -inkey mankey \
              -in mudfile -binary -outform DER -binary \
              -certfile intermediatecert -out mudfile.p7s
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Note: A MUD file may need to be re-signed if the signature expires.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="validate" title="Verifying a MUD File Signature">
<t>Prior to processing the rest of a MUD file, the MUD manager MUST
retrieve the MUD signature file by retrieving the value of
"mud-signature" and validating the signature across the MUD file. The
Key Usage Extension in the signing certificate MUST be present and
have the bit digitalSignature(0) set.  When the id-pe-mudsigner
extension is present in a device's X.509 certificate, the MUD
signature file MUST have been generated by a certificate whose subject
matches the contents of that id-pe-mudsigner extension.  If these
conditions are not met, or if it cannot validate the chain of trust to
a known trust anchor, the MUD manager MUST cease processing the MUD
file until an administrator has given approval.</t>

<t>The purpose of the signature on the file is to assign accountability
to an entity, whose reputation can be used to guide administrators on
whether or not to accept a given MUD file.  It is already common place
to check web reputation on the location of a server on which a file
resides.  While it is likely that the manufacturer will be the signer
of the file, this is not strictly necessary, and it may not be desirable.
For one thing, in some environments, integrators may install their own
certificates.  For another, what is more important is the
accountability of the recommendation, and not just the relationship
between the Thing and the file.</t>

<t>An example:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
% openssl cms -verify -in mudfile.p7s -inform DER -content mudfile
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Note the additional step of verifying the common trust root.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="ext" title="Extensibility">

<t>One of our design goals is to see that MUD files are able to be
understood by as broad a cross-section of systems as is possible.
Coupled with the fact that we have also chosen to leverage existing
mechanisms, we are left with no ability to negotiate extensions and a
limited desire for those extensions in any event.  As such, a
two-tier extensibility framework is employed, as follows:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>At a coarse grain, a protocol version is included in a MUD URL.
 This memo specifies MUD version 1.  Any and all changes are
 entertained when this version is bumped.  Transition approaches
 between versions would be a matter for discussion in future versions.</t>

  <t>At a finer grain, only extensions that would not incur additional
 risk to the Thing are permitted.  Specifically, adding nodes to the
 mud container is permitted with the understanding that such additions
 will be ignored by unaware implementations.  Any such extensions
 SHALL be standardized through the IETF process and MUST be named in
 the "extensions" list.  MUD managers MUST ignore YANG nodes they
 do not understand and SHOULD create an exception to be resolved by an
 administrator, so as to avoid any policy inconsistencies.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="depcon" title="Deployment Considerations">

<t>Because MUD consists of a number of architectural building blocks, it
is possible to assemble different deployment scenarios.  One key
aspect is where to place policy enforcement.  In order to protect the
Thing from other Things within a local deployment, policy can be
enforced on the nearest switch or access point.  In order to limit
unwanted traffic within a network, it may also be advisable to enforce
policy as close to the Internet as possible.  In some circumstances,
policy enforcement may not be available at the closest hop.  At that
point, the risk of lateral infection (infection of devices that reside
near one another) is increased to the number of Things that are able
to communicate without protection.</t>

<t>A caution about some of the classes: admission of a Thing into the
"manufacturer" and "same-manufacturer" class may have impact on the access
of other Things.  Put another way, the admission may grow the
access list on switches connected to other Things, depending on how
access is managed.  Some care should be given on managing that
access list growth.  Alternative methods such as additional
network segmentation can be used to keep that growth within reason.</t>

<t>Because as of this writing MUD is a new concept, one can expect a
great many devices to not have implemented it.  It remains a local
deployment decision as to whether a device that is first connected
should be allowed broad or limited access.  Furthermore, as mentioned
in the introduction, a deployment may choose to ignore a MUD policy in
its entirety and simply take into account the MUD URL as a
classifier to be used as part of a local policy decision.</t>

<t>Finally, please see directly below information regarding device lifetimes and use
of domain names.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="secon" title="Security Considerations">

<t>Based on how a MUD URL is emitted, a Thing may be able to lie about
what it is, thus gaining additional network access.  This can happen
in a number of ways when a device emits a MUD URL using DHCP or LLDP,
such as being inappropriately admitted to a class such as
"same-manufacturer", being given access to a device such as "my-controller",
or being permitted access to an Internet resource, where such access
would otherwise be disallowed.  Whether that is the case will depend
on the deployment.  Implementations SHOULD be configurable to disallow
additive access for devices using MUD URLs that are not emitted in a
secure fashion such as in a certificate.  Similarly, implementations
SHOULD NOT grant elevated permissions (beyond those of devices
presenting no MUD policy) to devices that do not strongly bind their
identity to their L2/L3 transmissions.  When insecure methods are used
by the MUD manager, the classes SHOULD NOT contain devices that use
both insecure and secure methods, in order to prevent privilege
escalation attacks, and MUST NOT contain devices with the same MUD URL
that are derived from both strong and weak authentication methods.</t>

<t>Devices may forge source (L2/L3) information.  Deployments should
apply appropriate protections to bind communications to the
authentication that has taken place.  For 802.1X authentication, IEEE
802.1AE (MACsec) <xref target="IEEE8021AE"/> is one means by which this may happen.
A similar approach can be used with 802.11i (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2)) <xref target="IEEE80211i"/>.
Other means are available with other lower-layer technologies.
Implementations using session-oriented access that is not
cryptographically bound should take care to remove state when any form
of break in the session is detected.</t>

<t>A rogue certification authority (CA) may sign a certificate that contains the same subject name
as is listed in the MUDsigner field in the manufacturer certificate,
thus seemingly permitting a substitute MUD file for a device.

There
are two mitigations available: First, if the signer changes, this may
be flagged as an exception by the MUD manager. Second, if the MUD file also
changes, the MUD manager SHOULD seek administrator approval (it should
do this in any case).  In all circumstances, the MUD manager MUST
maintain a cache of trusted CAs for this purpose.  When such a rogue
is discovered, it SHOULD be removed.</t>

<t>Additional mitigations are described below.</t>

<t>When certificates are not present, Things claiming to be of a certain
manufacturer SHOULD NOT be included in that manufacturer grouping
without additional validation of some form.  This will be relevant
when the MUD manager makes use of primitives such as "manufacturer" for
the purpose of accessing Things of a particular type.  Similarly,
network management systems may be able to fingerprint the Thing.  In
such cases, the MUD URL can act as a classifier that can be proven or
disproven.  Fingerprinting may have other advantages as well: when
802.1AR certificates are used, because they themselves cannot change,
fingerprinting offers the opportunity to add artifacts to the MUD
string in the form of the reserved field discussed in <xref target="dhcpopt"/>.
The meaning of such artifacts is left as future work.</t>

<t>MUD managers SHOULD NOT accept a usage description for a Thing with
the same Media Access Control (MAC) address that has indicated a change of the URL authority
without some additional validation (such as review by a network
administrator).  New Things that present some form of unauthenticated
MUD URL SHOULD be validated by some external means when they would be
given increased network access.</t>

<t>It may be possible for a rogue manufacturer to inappropriately
exercise the MUD file parser, in order to exploit a vulnerability.
There are two recommended approaches to address this threat.  The
first is to validate that the signer of the MUD file is known to and
trusted by the MUD manager.  The second is to have a system do a
primary scan of the file to ensure that it is both parseable and
believable at some level.  MUD files will likely be relatively small,
to start with.  The number of ACEs used by any given Thing should be
relatively small as well.  It may also be useful to limit retrieval of
MUD URLs to only those sites that are known to have decent web or
domain reputations.</t>

<t>Use of a URL necessitates the use of domain names.  If a domain name
changes ownership, the new owner of that domain may be able to provide
MUD files that MUD managers would consider valid. MUD managers
SHOULD cache certificates used by the MUD file server.  When a new
certificate is retrieved for whatever reason, the MUD manager
should check to see if ownership of the domain has changed.  A fair
programmatic approximation of this is when the name servers for the
domain have changed.  If the actual MUD file has changed, the
MUD manager MAY check the WHOIS database to see if registration
ownership of a domain has changed.  If a change has occurred, or if for
some reason it is not possible to determine whether ownership has
changed, further review may be warranted.  Note, this remediation does
not take into account the case of a Thing that was produced long ago
and only recently fielded, or the case where a new MUD manager has
been installed.</t>

<t>The release of a MUD URL by a Thing reveals what the Thing is and
provides an attacker with guidance on what vulnerabilities may be
present.</t>

<t>While the MUD URL itself is not intended to be unique to a specific
Thing, the release of the URL may aid an observer in identifying
individuals when combined with other information.  This is a privacy
consideration.</t>

<t>In addressing both of these concerns, implementors should take into
account what other information they are advertising through mechanisms
such as Multicast DNS (mDNS) <xref target="RFC6872"/>; how a Thing might otherwise be identified,
perhaps through how it behaves when it is connected to the network;
and whether a Thing is intended to be used by individuals or carry
personal identifying information, and then apply appropriate data
minimization techniques.  One approach is to make use of TEAP
<xref target="RFC7170"/> as the means to share information with authorized
components in the network.  Network elements may also assist in
limiting access to the MUD URL through the use of mechanisms such as
DHCPv6-Shield <xref target="RFC7610"/>.</t>

<t>There is the risk of the MUD manager itself being spied on to
determine what things are connected to the network.  To address this
risk, MUD managers may choose to make use of TLS proxies that they
trust that would aggregate other information.</t>

<t>Please note that the security considerations mentioned in Section 3.7
of <xref target="RFC8407"/> are not applicable in this case
because the YANG serialization is not intended to be accessed via
NETCONF.  However, for those who try to instantiate this model in a
network element via the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF), all objects in each model in this document
exhibit similar security characteristics as
<xref target="RFC8519"/>.  The basic purpose of MUD is to
configure access, so by its very nature, it can be disruptive if used
by unauthorized parties.</t>

<section anchor="defaults" title="Default MUD Nodes">

<t>What follows is the portion of a MUD file that permits DNS traffic to
a controller that is registered with the URN "urn:ietf:params:mud:dns"
and traffic NTP to a controller that is registered with
"urn:ietf:params:mud:ntp".  This is considered the default behavior,
and the ACEs are in effect appended to whatever other "ace" entries
that a MUD file contains.  To block DNS or NTP, one repeats the
matching statement but replaces the "forwarding" action "accept" with
"drop".  Because ACEs are processed in the order they are received,
the defaults would not be reached.  A MUD manager might further
decide to optimize to simply not include the defaults when they are
overridden.</t>

<t>Four "acl" list entries that implement default MUD nodes are listed
below.  Two are for IPv4 and two are for IPv6 (one in each direction
for both versions of IP).  Note that neither the access list name nor the ace
name need be retained or used in any way by local implementations; they are simply there for the sake of completeness.</t>

<section anchor="extexample" title="A Sample Extension: DETNET-indicator">

<t>In this sample extension, we augment the core MUD model to indicate
whether the device implements DETNET.  If a device claims not to use
DETNET, but then later attempts to do so, a notification or exception
might be generated.  Note that this example is intended only for
illustrative purposes.</t>

<t>This extension augments the MUD model to include a single node,
using the following sample module that has the following tree
structure:</t>
