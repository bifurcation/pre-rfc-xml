    <abstract>
      <t>Certification Authorities (CAs) within the Resource Public Key
      Infrastructure (RPKI) manage BGPsec router certificates as well as RPKI
      certificates. The rollover of BGPsec router certificates must be
      carefully performed in order to synchronize the distribution of router
      public keys with BGPsec UPDATE messages verified with those router
      public keys. This document describes a safe rollover process, and it 
      discusses when and why the rollover of BGPsec router certificates is
      necessary. When this rollover process is followed, the rollover will be
      performed without routing information being lost.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In BGPsec, a key rollover (or re-key) is the process of changing a
      router's BGPsec key pair (or key pairs), issuing the corresponding new
      BGPsec router certificate, and (if the old certificate is still valid)
      revoking the old certificate. This process will need to happen at
      regular intervals, normally due to policies of the local network. This
      document describes a safe rollover process that results in a BGPsec
      receiver always having the needed verification keys.   Certification
      Practice Statement (CPS) documents may reference this memo. This memo
      only addresses changing of a router's BGPsec key pair within the RPKI.
      Refer to <xref target="RFC6489"></xref> for a procedure to roll over RPKI
      Certification Authority key pairs.</t>

      <t>When a router receives or creates a new key pair (using a key
      provisioning mechanism), this key pair will be used to sign new BGPsec
      UPDATE messages <xref target="RFC8205"></xref> that are originated at or that
      transit through the BGP speaker. Additionally, the BGP speaker will
      refresh its outbound BGPsec UPDATE messages to include a signature using
      the new key (replacing the old key). When the rollover process finishes,
      the old BGPsec router certificate (and its key) will no longer be valid;
      thus, any BGPsec UPDATE message that includes a signature performed by the
      old key will be invalid. Consequently, if the router does not refresh
      its outbound BGPsec UPDATE messages, previously sent routing information
      may be treated as unauthenticated after the rollover process is
      finished. Therefore, it is extremely important that new BGPsec router
      certificates have been distributed throughout the RPKI before the router
      begins signing BGPsec UPDATE messages with a new private key.</t>

      <t>It is also important for an AS to minimize the BGPsec router
      key-rollover interval (i.e., the period between the time when an AS
      distributes a BGPsec router certificate with a new public key and the
      time a BGPsec router begins to use its new private key). This can be due
      to a need for a BGPsec router to distribute BGPsec UPDATE messages signed with a
      new private key in order to invalidate BGPsec UPDATE messages signed with the
      old private key. In particular, if the AS suspects that a stale BGPsec
      UPDATE message is being distributed instead of the most recently signed
      attribute, it can cause the stale BGPsec UPDATE messages to be invalidated by
      completing a key-rollover procedure. The BGPsec router rollover interval
      can be minimized when an automated certificate provisioning process such
      as Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) <xref target="RFC7030"></xref>
      is used.</t>

      <t>"Security Requirements for BGP Path Validation" <xref
      target="RFC7353"></xref> also describes the need for protecting against
      suppression of BGP UPDATE messages with Withdrawn Routes or replay of BGP UPDATE messages,
      such as controlling BGPsec's window of exposure to such attacks. The
      BGPsec router certificate rollover method in this document can be used
      to achieve this goal.</t>

      <t>In <xref target="RFC8635"></xref>, the
      "operator-driven" method is introduced, in which a key pair can be
      shared among multiple BGP speakers. In this scenario, the rollover of
      the corresponding BGPsec router certificate will impact all the BGP
      speakers sharing the same private key.</t>

    <section anchor="BGPSEC" title="Key Rollover in BGPsec">
      <t>A BGPsec router certificate SHOULD be replaced when the following
      events occur, and it can be replaced for any other reason at the discretion
      of the AS responsible for the BGPsec router certificate.<list
          hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Scheduled rollover:">BGPsec router certificates have an
          expiration date (NotValidAfter) that requires a frequent rollover
          process to refresh certificates or issue new certificates. The
          validity period for these certificates is typically expressed in the
          CA's CPS document.</t>

          <t hangText="Router certificate field changes:">Information
          contained in a BGPsec router certificate (such as the Autonomous System Number (ASN) or the
          Subject) may need to be changed.</t>

          <t hangText="Emergency router key rollover:">Some special
          circumstances (such as a compromised key) may require the
          replacement of a BGPsec router certificate.</t>

          <t
          hangText="Protection against withdrawal suppression and replay attacks:">An
          AS may determine that withdrawn BGPsec UPDATE messages are being propagated
          instead of the most recently propagated BGPsec UPDATE messages. Changing the
          BGPsec router signing key, distributing a new BGPsec router
          certificate, and revoking the old BGPsec router certificate will
          invalidate the replayed BGPsec UPDATE messages.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In some of these cases, it is possible to generate a new certificate
      without changing the key pair. This practice simplifies the rollover
      process as the BGP speakers receiving BGPsec UPDATE messages do not even need to
      be aware of the change of certificate. However, not replacing the
      certificate key for a long period of time increases the risk that a
      compromised router private key may be used by an attacker to deliver
      unauthorized or false BGPsec UPDATE messages. Distributing the old public key in
      a new certificate is NOT RECOMMENDED when the rollover event is due to a
      compromised key or when it is suspected that withdrawn BGPsec UPDATE messages 
      are being distributed.</t>

      <section anchor="re-keying" title="Rollover Process">
        <t>The key-rollover process is dependent on the key provisioning
        mechanisms adopted by an AS <xref
        target="RFC8635"></xref>. An automatic provisioning
        mechanism such as EST will allow procedures for router key management to
        include automatic re-keying methods with minimum development cost.</t>

        <t>A safe BGPsec router key-rollover process is as follows. <list
            style="numbers">
            <t>New Certificate Publication: The first step in the rollover
            mechanism is to publish the new certificate. If required, a new
            key pair will be generated for the BGPsec router. A new
            certificate will be generated and the certificate will be published at the
            appropriate RPKI repository publication point. The details of this
            process will vary as they depend on 1) whether the keys are assigned
            per-BGPsec speaker or shared among multiple BGPsec speakers,
            2) whether the keys are generated on each BGPsec speaker or in a
            central location, and 3) whether the RPKI repository is locally or
            externally hosted.</t>

            <t>Staging Period: A staging period will be required from the time
            a new certificate is published in the global RPKI repository until
            the time it is fetched by RPKI caches around the globe. The exact
            minimum staging time will be dictated by the conventional interval
            chosen between repository fetches. If rollovers will be done more
            frequently, an administrator can provision two certificates for
            every router concurrently with different valid start times. In
            this case, when the rollover operation is needed, the relying
            parties around the globe would already have the new router public
            keys. However, if an administrator has not previously provisioned
            the next certificate, implementing a staging period may not be possible
            during emergency key rollover. If there is no staging
            period, routing may be disrupted due to the inability of a BGPsec
            router to validate BGPsec UPDATE messages signed with a new private
            key.</t>

            <t>Twilight: In this step, the BGPsec speaker holding the
            rolled-over private key will stop using the old key for
            signing and will start using the new key. Also, the router
            will generate appropriate refreshed BGPsec UPDATE messages, just
            as in the typical operation of refreshing outbound BGP
            polices. This operation may generate a great number of
            BGPsec UPDATE messages.  A BGPsec speaker may vary the
            distribution of BGPsec UPDATE messages in this step for
            every peer in order to distribute the system load (e.g.,
            skewing the rollover for different peers by a few minutes
            each would be sufficient and effective).</t>

            <t>Certificate Revocation: This is an optional step, but it SHOULD be
            taken when the goal is to invalidate BGPsec UPDATE messages signed with
            the old key. Reasons to invalidate old BGPsec UPDATE messages include (a)
            the AS has reason to believe that the router signing key has been
            compromised, and (b) the AS needs to invalidate already-propagated
            BGPsec UPDATE messages signed with the old key. As part of the rollover
            process, a CA MAY decide to revoke the old certificate by
            publishing its serial number on the CA's Certificate Revocation List (CRL). Alternatively, the
            CA will just let the old certificate expire and not revoke it.
            This choice will depend on the reasons that motivated the rollover
            process.</t>

            <t>RPKI-Router Protocol Withdrawals: At the expiration of the old
            certificate's validation, the RPKI relying parties around the
            globe will need to communicate to their router peers that the old
            certificate's public key is no longer valid (e.g., using the
            RPKI-Router Protocol described in <xref target="RFC8210"></xref>).
            A router's reaction to a message indicating withdrawal of a router
            key in the RPKI-Router Protocol SHOULD include the removal of any
            RIB entries (i.e., BGPsec updates) signed with that key and the
            generation of the corresponding BGP UPDATE message with Withdrawn Routes (either implicit
            or explicit).</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>This rollover mechanism depends on the existence of an automatic
        provisioning process for BGPsec router certificates. It requires a
        staging mechanism based on the RPKI propagation time (at the time of writing, this is typically a 24-hour period), and an AS is
        REQUIRED to re-sign all originated and transited BGPsec UPDATE messages that
        were previously signed with the old key.</t>

        <t>The first two steps (New Certificate Publication and Staging
        Period) may happen in advance of the rest of the process. This will
        allow a network operator to perform its subsequent key rollover in an
        efficient and timely manner.</t>

        <t>When a new BGPsec router certificate is generated without changing
        its key, steps 3 (Twilight) and 5 (RPKI-Router Protocol Withdrawals)
        SHOULD NOT be executed.</t>

    <section anchor="replay"
             title="BGPsec Router Key Rollover as a Measure against Replay Attacks">
      <t>There are two typical generic measures to mitigate replay attacks in
      any protocol: the addition of a timestamp or the addition of a serial
      number. However, neither BGP nor BGPsec provides these measures. The
      timestamp approach was originally proposed for BGPsec <xref
      target="PROTECTION-DESIGN-DISCUSSION"></xref> but
      was later dropped in favor of the key-rollover approach. This section
      discusses the use of key rollover as a measure to mitigate
      replay attacks.</t>

      <section anchor="requirements"
               title="BGP UPDATE Window of Exposure Requirement">
        <t>The need to limit the vulnerability to replay attacks is described
        in Section 4.3 of <xref target="RFC7353"></xref>. One important comment
        is that during a window of exposure, a replay attack is effective only
        in very specific circumstances: there is a downstream topology change
        that makes the signed AS path no longer current, and the topology
        change makes the replayed route preferable to the route associated
        with the new update. In particular, if there is no topology change at
        all, then no security threat comes from a replay of a BGPsec UPDATE message
        because the signed information is still valid.</t>

        <t>"BGPsec Operational Considerations" <xref
        target="RFC8207"></xref> gives some idea of requirements for the size
        of the window of exposure to replay attacks. It states that the
        requirement will be in the order of a day or longer.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="proposal"
               title="BGPsec Key Rollover as a Mechanism to Protect against Replay Attacks">
        <t>Since the window requirement is on the order of a day (as
        documented in <xref target="RFC8207"></xref>) and the BGP speaker
        performing re-keying is the edge router of the origin AS, it is
        feasible to use key rollover to mitigate replays. In this case, it is
        important to complete the full process (i.e., the old and new
        certificates do not share the same key). By re-keying, an AS is
        letting the BGPsec router certificate validation time be a type of
        "timestamp" to mitigate replay attacks. However, the use of frequent
        key rollovers comes with an additional administrative cost and risks
        if the process fails.


	As documented in <xref target="RFC8207"/>, re-keying should be supported by automatic tools, and for the
  great majority of the Internet, it will be done with good lead time to
  ensure that the public key corresponding to the new router
  certificate will be available to validate the corresponding BGPsec
  UPDATE messages when received.
</t>

        <t>If a transit AS also originates BGPsec UPDATE messages for its own prefixes
        and it wishes to mitigate replay attacks on those prefixes, then the
        transit AS SHOULD be provisioned with two unique key pairs and
        certificates. One of the key pairs is used to sign BGPsec UPDATE messages for
        prefixes originated from the transit AS, and it can have a replay
        protection policy applied to it. The other key pair is used to sign
        BGPsec UPDATE messages in transit and SHOULD NOT have a replay protection policy
        applied to it. Because the transit AS is not likely to know or care
        about the policy of origin ASes elsewhere, there is no value gained by the
        transit AS performing key rollovers to mitigate replay attacks against
        prefixes originated elsewhere. If the transit AS were instead to
        perform replay protection for all updates that it signs, its process for key
        rollovers would generate a large number of BGPsec UPDATE
        messages, even in the complete Default-Free Zone (DFZ). Therefore, it
        is best to let each AS independently manage the replay attack
        vulnerability window for the prefixes it originates. </t>

        <t>Advantages to re-keying as a replay attack protection mechanism are
        as follows:<list style="numbers">
            <t>All expiration policies are maintained in the RPKI.</t>

            <t>Much of the additional administrative cost is paid by the
            provider that wants to protect its infrastructure, as it bears the
            cost of creating and initiating distribution of new router key
            pairs and BGPsec router certificates. (It is true that the cost of
            relying parties will be affected by the new objects, but their
            responses should be completely automated or otherwise
            routine.)</t>

            <t>The re-keying can be implemented in coordination with planned
            topology changes by either origin ASes or transit ASes (e.g., if
            an AS changes providers, it completes a key rollover).</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Disadvantages to re-keying as replay attack protection mechanism
        are as follows: <list style="numbers">
            <t>Frequent rollovers add administrative and BGP processing loads,
            although the required frequency is not clear. Some initial ideas
            are found in <xref target="RFC8207"></xref>.</t>

            <t>The minimum replay vulnerability is bounded by the propagation
            time for RPKI caches to obtain the new certificate and CRL (2x
            propagation time because first the new certificate and then the
            CRL need to propagate through the RPKI system). If provisioning is
            done ahead of time, the minimum replay vulnerability window size
            is reduced to 1x propagation time (i.e., propagation of the CRL).
            However, these bounds will be better understood when the RPKI
   and RPKI relying party software are well deployed; this will also contribute to the propagation time for
   objects in the RPKI being better understood.
</t>

            <t>Re-keying increases the dynamics and size of the RPKI
            repository.</t>

      <t>This document does not contain a protocol update to either the RPKI
      or BGPsec. It describes a process for managing BGPsec router
      certificates within the RPKI.</t>

      <t>Routers participating in BGPsec will need to roll over their signing
      keys as part of conventional processing of certificate management. However,
      because rolling over signing keys will also have the effect of
      invalidating BGPsec UPDATE message signatures, the rollover process must be
      carefully orchestrated to ensure that valid BGPsec UPDATE messages are not
      treated as invalid. This situation could affect Internet routing. This
      document describes a safe method for rolling over BGPsec router
      certificates. It takes into account both normal and emergency key-rollover requirements.</t>

      <t>Additionally, the key-rollover method described in this document can
      be used as a measure to mitigate BGP UPDATE replay attacks, in which an
      entity in the routing system is suppressing current BGPsec UPDATE messages and
      replaying withdrawn updates. When the key used to sign the withdrawn
      updates has been rolled over, the withdrawn updates will be considered
      invalid. When certificates containing a new public key are provisioned
      ahead of time, the minimum replay vulnerability window size is reduced
      to the propagation time of a CRL invalidating the certificate containing
      an old public key. For a discussion of the difficulties deploying a more
      effectual replay protection mechanism for BGPSEC, see <xref
