<section title="Introduction">
	<t>This document provides the network management framework for the
Transport Profile for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP).  Requirements
for network management in an MPLS-TP network are documented in <xref
target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-nm-req">"Network Management Requirements for
MPLS-based Transport Networks"</xref>, and this
document explains how network elements and networks that support MPLS-TP can be
managed using solutions that satisfy those requirements.  The relationship
between Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM), management, and other
framework documents is described in the <xref
target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-framework"> MPLS-TP framework</xref> document.

	<section title="Terminology">
		<t>This framework relies on the management terminology from the ITU-T to describe the management architecture that could be used for an MPLS-TP management network.  The terminology listed below are taken from/based on the definitions found in <xref target="ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701">ITU-T G.7710</xref>, <xref target="ITU-T G.7712/Y.1703">ITU-T G.7712</xref>, and <xref target="ITU-T M.3013">ITU-T M.3013</xref>.

	<t>The management of the MPLS-TP network could be based on a
multi-tiered distributed management systems, for example as described in <xref
target="ITU-T M.3010">ITU-T M.3010</xref> and <xref target="ITU-T M.3060/Y.2401">ITU-T M.3060/Y.2401</xref>. Each tier provides a predefined
level of network management capabilities. The lowest tier of this organization
model includes the MPLS-TP network element that provides the transport service
and the Operations System (OS) at the Element Management Level. The Management Application Function (MAF) within the NEs and OSs provides the management
support. The MAF at each entity can include agents only, managers only, or both
agents and managers. The MAF that includes managers is capable of managing an
agent included in other MAF. 
	</t>

	<t>The management communication to peer NEs and/or OSs is provided via the Message Communication Function (MCF) within each entity (e.g., NE and OS). The user can access the management of the MPLS-TP transport network via a Local Craft Terminal (LCT) attached to the NE or via a Work Station (WS) attached to the OS.

ambiguity, we will use "MN" for an MPLS-TP-specific MN.  In the figure below,
O.MSN is equivalent to an OTN management Subnetwork.

		<t>The management of the MPLS-TP network is separable from the
management of the other technology-specific networks, and it operates independently of any particular client- or server-layer management plane.
		</t>

		<t>An MPLS-TP Management Network (MT.MN) could be partitioned
into MPLS-TP Management SubNetworks ("MT.MSN" or "MPLS-TP MSN", or just "MSN"
where usage is unambiguous) for consideration of scalability (e.g., geographic
or load balancing) or administration (e.g., operation or ownership). 
		</t>

		<t>The MPLS-TP MSN could be connected to other parts of the MN through one or more LCTs and/or OSs. The Message Communication Function (MCF) of an MPLS-TP NE initiates/terminates, routes, or otherwise processes management messages over CChs or via an external interface.
		</t>

		<t>Multiple addressable MPLS-TP NEs could be present at a single physical location (i.e., site or office). The inter-site communications link between the MPLS-TP NEs will normally be provided by the CChs. Within a particular site, the NEs could communicate via an intra-site CCh or via a LAN.
		</t>

	</section>

	<section anchor="Element Management Architecture" title="Element Management Architecture">
		<t>The Equipment Management Function (EMF) of an MPLS-TP NE provides the means through which a management system manages the NE.
		</t>

		<t>The EMF interacts with the NE's transport functions by exchanging Management Information (MI) across the Management Point (MP) Reference Points. The EMF may contain a number of functions that provide a data reduction mechanism on the information received across the MP Reference Points.
		</t>

		<t>The EMF includes functions such as Date and Time, FCAPS
(Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security) management, and
Control Plane functions.  The EMF provides event message processing, data
storage, and logging. The management Agent, a component of the EMF, converts
internal management information (MI signals) into Management Application
messages and vice versa. The Agent responds to Management Application messages
from the Message Communication Function (MCF) by performing the appropriate
operations on (for example) the Managed Objects in a Management Information
Base (MIB), as necessary. The MCF contains communications functions related to
the world outside of the NE (i.e., Date and Time source, Management Plane,
Control Plane, Local Craft Terminal, and Local Alarms). 
		</t>

		<t>The Date and Time functions keep track of the NE's date/time, which is used by the FCAPS management functions to e.g., time stamp event reports.

Equipment Management Function (EMF) of a Network Element (NE).  <xref

	<section anchor="Standard Management Interfaces" title="Standard Management Interfaces">
		<t> The <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-nm-req"> "Network
Management Requirements for MPLS-based Transport Networks" document</xref> places no restriction on which management
interface is to be used for managing an MPLS-TP network.  It is possible to
provision and manage an end-to-end connection across a network where some
segments are created/managed/deleted, for example by NETCONF or SNMP and other
segments by CORBA interfaces.  Use of any network management interface for one
management-related purpose does not preclude use of another network management
interface for other management-related purposes, or the same purpose at another
time. The protocol(s) to be supported are at the discretion of the operator.

	  title="Management- and Control-Specific Terminology">

		<t>Data Communication Network (DCN) is the common term for the
network used to transport Management and Signaling information between:
management systems and network elements, management systems to other management
systems, and networks elements to other network elements.  The Management
Communications Network (MCN) is the part of the DCN that supports the
transport of Management information for the Management Plane.  The Signaling
Communications Network (SCN) is the part of the DCN that supports transport
of signaling information for the Control Plane.  As shown in  
		<xref target="communication_channel_terminology">, the
communication channel terminology picture </xref> each technology has its own
terminology that is used for the channels that support the transfer of
management and control plane information.  For MPLS-TP, the management
plane uses the Management Communication Channel (MCC), and the control plane
uses the Signaling Communication Channel (SCC). 
		</t>

	<section anchor="Management Channel" title="Management Channel">
		<t>The Communication Channel (CCh) provides a logical channel between NEs for transferring Management and/or Signaling information. Note that some technologies provide separate communication channels for Management (MCC) and Signaling (SCC).

		<t>MPLS-TP NEs communicate via the DCN. The DCN connects NEs with management systems, NEs with NEs, and management systems with management systems.

	<t>A fault is the inability of a function to perform a required action.  This does not include an inability due to preventive maintenance, lack of external resources, or planned actions.  Fault management provides the mechanisms to detect, verify, isolate, notify, and recover from the fault.

	<section anchor="Supervision" title="Supervision">
		<t><xref target="ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701">ITU-T G.7710</xref> lists
five basic categories of supervision that provide the functionality necessary
to detect, verify, and notify a fault.  The categories are:  Transmission
Supervision, Quality of Service Supervision, Processing Supervision, Hardware
Supervision, and Environment Supervision.  Each of the categories provides a
set of recommendations to ensure that the fault management process is fulfilled.

	<section anchor="Validation" title="Validation">

<section anchor="Configuration Management" title="Configuration Management">
	<t>Configuration management provides the mechanisms to:
	<list style="symbols">
	<t> provision the MPLS-TP services
	</t>
	<t> set up security for the MPLS-TP services and MPLS-TP network elements
	</t>

	</t>
</list>
</t>

	<t>Also associated with configuration management are hardware and software provisioning and inventory reporting.
	</t>

	<section anchor="LSP ownership handover" title="LSP Ownership Handover">
		<t>MPLS-TP networks can be managed not only by Network Management Systems (i.e., Management Plane (MP)), but also by Control Plane (CP) protocols.  The utilization of the control plane is not a mandatory requirement (see <xref target="RFC5654">MPLS-TP Requirements</xref>), but it is often used by network operators in order to make network configuration and Label Switched Path (LSP) recovery both faster and simpler.
		</t>

		<t>In networks where both CP and MP are provided, an LSP could be created by either (CP or MP).  The entity creating an LSP owns the data plane resources comprising that LSP.  Only the owner of an LSP is typically able to modify/delete it.  This results in a need for interaction between the MP and CP to allow either to manage all the resources of a network.
		</t>

		<t>Network operators might prefer to have full control of the network resources during the set-up phase and then allow the network to be automatically maintained by the Control Plane. This can be achieved by creating LSPs via the Management Plane and subsequently transferring LSP ownership to the Control Plane. This is referred to as "ownership handover" <xref target="RFC5493">RFC 5493</xref>.  MP to CP ownership handover is then considered a requirement where a Control Plane is in use that supports it.  The converse (CP to MP ownership handover) is a feature that is recommended -- but not required -- for (G)MPLS networks because it has only minor applications (for example, moving LSPs from one path to another as a maintenance operation).
		</t>

		<t>The LSP handover procedure has already been standardized for GMPLS networks, where the signaling protocol used is RSVP-TE (<xref target="RFC3209">RFC 3209</xref>). The utilization of RSVP-TE enhancements are defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-pc-spc-rsvpte-ext"></xref>.
		</t>

		<t>MP and CP interworking also includes the exchange of
information that is either requested by the MP, or a notification by the CP as
a consequence of a request from the MP or an automatic action (for example, a
failure occurs or an operation is performed). The CP is asked to notify the MP
in a reliable manner about the status of the operations it performs and to
provide a mechanism to monitor the status of Control Plane objects (e.g., TE
Link status, available resources), and to log operations related to Control Plane LSP. Logging is one of the most critical aspects because the MP always needs to have an accurate history and status of each LSP and all Data Plane resources involved in it.

</section>

<section anchor="Performance Management" title="Performance Management">
	<t>Performance statistics could overwhelm a Management Network, so it
is important to provide flexible instrumentation that enables control over the
amount of performance data to be collected.  Mechanisms for limiting the
quantity of information collected are well known and deployed in IETF standards
(see <xref target="RFC2819">RFC 2819 (RMON) </xref> and <xref
target="RFC4502">RFC 4502 (RMON2) </xref>).  The details of the performance
data collected (including loss and delay measurement data) are found in the
<xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-nm-req"> "Network Management Requirements for
MPLS-based Transport Networks" document</xref>.
	</t>

	<t>A distinction is made between performance data that is collected
on-demand and data that is collected proactively.  The definitions of on-demand
and proactive measurement are provided for OAM in the <xref
target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-nm-req"> "Network Management Requirements for
MPLS-based Transport Networks" document</xref>.
	</t>
	
	<t>On-demand measurement provides the operator with the ability to do performance measurement for maintenance purpose, such as diagnosis or to provide detailed verification of proactive measurement. It is used typically on specific LSP service instances for a limited time, thus limiting its impact on network performance under normal operations. Therefore, on-demand measurement does not result in scaling issues. 
	</t>
	
	<t>Proactive measurement is used continuously over time after being configured with periodicity and storage information. Data collected from proactive measurement are usually used for verifying the performance of the service.  Proactive performance monitoring has the potential to overwhelm both the process of collecting performance data at a network element (for some arbitrary number of service instances traversing the NE), and the process of reporting this information to the OS. As a consequence of these considerations, operators would typically limit the services to which proactive performance measurement would be applied to a very selective subset of the services being provided and would limit the reporting of this information to statistical summaries (as opposed to raw or detailed performance statistics).

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
	<t>The ability for the authorized network operator to access EMF
interfaces (Section 2.3) when needed is critical to proper operation.
Therefore, the EMF interfaces need to be protected from denial-of-service
conditions or attack.  The EMF interfaces that use or access private
information should be protected from eavesdropping, mis-configuration, and/or
mal-configuration by unauthorized network elements, systems, or users. 
	</t>
	<t>Performance of diagnostic functions and path characterization
involves extracting a significant amount of information about network
construction that the network operator considers private.

<abstract>
<t>This document specifies an architectural framework for the application of
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) to the construction of packet-switched
transport networks. It describes a common set of protocol functions -- the MPLS
Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) -- that supports the operational models and
capabilities typical of such networks, including signaled or explicitly
provisioned bidirectional connection-oriented paths, protection and restoration
mechanisms, comprehensive Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)
functions, and network operation in the absence of a dynamic control plane or
IP forwarding support. Some of these functions are defined in existing MPLS
specifications, while others require extensions to existing specifications to
meet the requirements of the MPLS-TP.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This document defines the
subset of the MPLS-TP applicable in general and to point-to-point transport
paths. The remaining subset, applicable specifically to point-to-multipoint
transport paths, is outside the scope of this document.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This
document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) /
International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector
(ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and
Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures to support the
capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by
the ITU-T. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it

<abstract>
<t>In a transport network scenario, Data Plane connections controlled by either
a Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Control Plane (Soft
Permanent Connections - SPC) or a Management System (Permanent Connections -
PC) may independently coexist. The ability of transforming an existing PC into
an SPC and vice versa -- without actually affecting Data Plane traffic being
carried over it -- is a requirement. The requirements for the conversion
between permanent connections and switched connections in a GMPLS Network are
defined in RFC 5493.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This memo describes an extension to GMPLS
Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling that
enables the transfer of connection ownership between the Management and the
Control Planes. Such a transfer is referred to as a Handover. This document
defines all Handover-related procedures. This includes the handling of failure
conditions and subsequent reversion to original state. A basic premise of the
extension is that the Handover procedures must never impact an already
established Data Plane connection. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t></abstract></front>
