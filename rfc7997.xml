 <abstract>
   <t>
In order to support the internationalization of protocols and a more
diverse Internet community, the RFC Series must evolve to allow for 
the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs.  While English remains the 
required language of the Series, the encoding of future RFCs will
be in UTF-8, allowing for a broader range of characters than typically
used in the English language.  This document describes the RFC Editor 
requirements and gives guidance regarding the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs.
   </t>
   <t>
This document updates RFC 7322. Please view this document in PDF form to see the full text.

<section title="Introduction">
<t>
Please review the PDF version of this draft. 
</t>
<t>
For much of the history of the RFC Series, the character encoding used
for RFCs has been <xref target="RFC20">ASCII</xref>.  
This was a sensible choice at the time: the language of the Series has
always been English, a language that primarily uses ASCII-encoded characters 
(ignoring for a moment words borrowed from more richly decorated alphabets); 
and, ASCII is the "lowest common denominator" for character encoding, making 
cross-platform viewing trivial.
</t>
<t>
There are limits to ASCII, however, that hinder its continued use as the
exclusive character encoding for the Series.  The increasing need for 
easily readable, internationalized content suggests it is time to allow 
non-ASCII characters in RFCs where necessary.  To support this move away 
from ASCII, RFCs will switch to supporting UTF-8 as the default character 
encoding and will allow support for a broad range of Unicode characters 
<xref target="UnicodeCurrent"/>.  Note that the RFC Editor may reject any code point that does not render 
adequately across all formats or in enough rendering engines using the v3
tooling.
</t>
<t>
Given the continuing goal of maximum readability across platforms, the
use of non-ASCII characters should be limited to only where 
necessary within the text.  This document describes the rules under which 
non-ASCII characters may be used in an RFC.  These rules will be applied 
as the necessary changes are made to submission checking and editorial
tools.
</t>
<t>
This document updates the <xref target="RFC7322">RFC Style Guide</xref>.
</t>
<t>The details included in this document are expected to change based on
experience gained in implementing the new publication toolsets. Revised
documents will be published capturing those changes as the toolsets are
completed. Other implementers must not expect those changes to remain
backwards compatible with the details included in this document.</t> 


</section>

<section title="Basic Requirements">
<t>
Two fundamental requirements inform the guidance and examples provided
in this document.  They are:
</t>
<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Searches against RFC indexes and database tables need to return
expected results and support appropriate Unicode string matching
behaviors; </t>

  <t>RFCs must be able to be displayed correctly across a wide range of
readers and browsers.  People whose systems do not have the fonts needed to
display a particular RFC need to be able to read the various publication 
formats and the XML correctly in order to understand and implement the 
information described in the document.</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Rules for the Use of Non-ASCII Characters">
<t>
This section describes the guidelines for the use of non-ASCII characters 
in an RFC.  If the RFC Editor identifies areas where the use of non-ASCII 
characters negatively impacts 
the readability of the text, they will request alternate text.
</t>
<t>
The RFC Editor may, in cases of entire words represented in non-ASCII
characters, ask for a set of reviewers to verify the meaning, spelling, 
characters, and grammar of the text.
</t>

<section title="General Usage throughout a Document">
<t>
Where the use of non-ASCII characters is purely part of an example
and not otherwise required for correct protocol operation, escaping 
the non-ASCII character is not required.  Note, however, that as the 
language of the RFC Series is English, the use of non-ASCII characters 
is based on the spelling of words commonly used in the English language 
following the guidance in the <xref target="MerrWeb">Merriam-Webster 
dictionary</xref>. 
</t>
<t>
The RFC Editor will use the primary spelling listed in that dictionary
by default.
</t>
<t>Example of non-ASCII characters that do not require escaping
(example from Section 3.1.1.12 of RFC 4475 <xref target="RFC4475"/>, with a hex dump
replaced by the actual character glyphs):

<section title="Person Names">
<t>
Person names may appear in several places within an RFC (e.g., the header, Acknowledgements, and References). When a script 
outside the Unicode Latin blocks <xref target="UNICODE-CHART"/> is used for an
individual name, an
author-provided, ASCII-only identifier will appear immediately after the
non-Latin characters, surrounded by parentheses. This will improve general
readability of the text.

The reference entry must be in English; whatever subfields are present

As long as 
good sense is used, the reference entry may also include non-ASCII

The RFC Editor may request that a third party, such as a language

<abstract><t>This document defines the "xml2rfc" version 3 vocabulary: an XML- based language used for writing RFCs and Internet-Drafts.  It is heavily derived from the version 2 vocabulary that is also under discussion.  This document obsoletes the v2 grammar described in RFC 2629 and its followup, RFC 7749.  Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)  Discussion of this draft takes place on the rfc-interest mailing list (rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org), which has its home page at &lt;https://www.rfc-editor.org/mailman/listinfo/rfc-interest>.</t></abstract>
